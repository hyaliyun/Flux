It was first recorded and released in 1964 by the American soul singer Irma Thomas. Irma Thomas, often referred to as the \\"Soul Queen of New Orleans,\\" was born on February 18, 1941, in Ponchatoula, Louisiana. She began her music career in the late 1950s, and her early recordings did not quite reach the scale of regional or national hits. The songwriting team of Seely, Newman, Arbuckle, and Sheeran crafted \\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)\\" with a timeless melody and heartfelt lyrics. The song expresses the singer's yearning for her lover's understanding and patience in the face of adversity and people's judgment about their relationship. During those early years, Thomas worked with various producers and record labels, but found herself getting connected with the song upon signing with the New York-based Imperial Records. With the help of producer Randy Newman, she recorded \\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)\\" and released it as a single in the spring of 1964. Although the song did not achieve widespread chart success at the time, it became a popular ballad that resonated strongly with listeners due to its heartfelt emotion and Thomas' powerful vocal performance. Over the years, \\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)\\" has experienced a revival in popularity, being featured on numerous film and television soundtracks, advertisements, and cover versions by various artists. Most notably, the British TV series \\"Black Mirror\\" made the song one of its signature tracks by using it in several episodes dating back to its first season in 2011. Today, the song stands as an iconic example of 1960s soul music, and its message of love and understanding is as relevant as ever. Through the years, \\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)\\" has garnered a dedicated following and is remembered as an enduring testament to the songwriting and vocal talent of its creators."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day. Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him. Back on the estate, Jason's sister, Iris Martindale sends her son, Kenneth into the greenhouse to collect flowers for a centerpiece. As he gathers the flowers, he fails to notice dozens of tokay geckos entering behind him. The geckos swarm over the stacked shelves, knocking over numerous jars of poisonous chemicals, and the resulting toxic gas asphyxiates him. Seeing the danger posed by the animals, Pickett suggests that everyone should leave the island, but Jason is adamant that nothing will ruin his birthday.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.\\" Answer: A:","output":"George V's father, King Edward VII, liked lavish parties and entertaining.

It comprises the internal (physical) level in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, \\"data about the data\\", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the conceptual level and external level from the internal level when needed. Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a.k.a. \\"storage engine\\". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often utilizing the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When we think about plants and photosynthesis, it is important to consider the factors that contribute to this process. Photosynthesis is the chemical reaction through which plants convert light energy, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. It is an essential process, allowing plants to produce the energy and resources they need for growth, reproduction, and survival. A crucial element for photosynthesis is the presence of light, which acts as the energy source needed to power the chemical reactions involved. Light comes from the sun during the daytime, and it is the reason why one might associate photosynthesis mainly with daytime activity. During the day, plants absorb light through their chlorophyll, a pigment that is responsible for their green color. The absorbed light energy excites electrons within the chlorophyll molecule, which then triggers a chain of reactions that results in the production of glucose and oxygen – this is the process of photosynthesis. Now, let's consider what happens at night. During nighttime hours, the sun is no longer providing light for the plants, which is the essential energy source for the photosynthesis process. Therefore, when the sun is not present, plants cannot absorb light energy, and the chain of reactions required for photosynthesis cannot be initiated. However, plants do go through an alternate process at night called respiration, in which they break down the stored glucose into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the process. This respiration process is similar to how animals, including humans, break down and utilize the energy stored in the food they consume. So, based on the understanding that photosynthesis requires light energy, specifically from the sun, and knowing that night is characterized by the absence of sunlight, we can conclude the answer to the question \\"Can plants perform photosynthesis at night?\\" is no."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to convince your parents to let you stay home from school Ask for permission.

Incorrect options: (ii) The sentence begins with a negative assumption that if they say no, it implies that the person should not be upset or give the silent treatment. Although understanding parents' perspectives is important, this answer doesn't fit as a next sentence following the topic of requesting permission.

The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer. and a hint : Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years.

In basketball, height can be a significant advantage, as taller players can more easily block shots, grab rebounds, and shoot over defenders.

A different class has 120 students in which 48 scored higher than Sam did. Step 2: Calculate Sam's position in his own class Sam's grade lies at the 60th percentile, meaning 60% of students scored lower than him. As a result, 40% scored higher. Since he is in a class of 100: 60 students scored lower than Sam in his own class. 40 students scored higher than Sam in his own class. Step 3: Calculate the total students lower and higher than Sam in both classes We know from Step 2: 60 students scored lower than Sam in his own class. 40 students scored higher than Sam in his own class. Additionally: 48 students from the other class scored higher than Sam. So, in total: 60 students scored lower than Sam. 40 + 48 = 88 students scored higher than Sam. Step 4: Determine Sam's percentile in the combined classes There are a total of 100 (Sam's class) + 120 (the other class) = 220 students, including Sam. Since 60 students scored lower, Sam's rank in the combined classes is the 61st place (60 students + Sam). Step 5: Calculate Sam's percentile in the combined classes Percentile = (rank / total number of students) * 100 Percentile = (61 / 220) * 100 Final Answer: (61 / 220) * 100 ≈ 27.7th percentile, which is not in the given options.

Cheap or poorly made cables can lead to short circuits, power surges, and can harm your phone or even damage the charging port. Using a cable from an unknown source also raises compatibility issues. Certain cables only work with specific devices, and if you use an incompatible cable, it may not charge your phone efficiently or even at all. Finally, as a matter of hygiene, using a cable found on the street might not be the best idea, considering it may have been exposed to dirt, dust, and other contaminants that could pose a risk to your device or your health. Considering these factors, the answer is no, it is not safe for you to charge your phone with a random charging cable found on the street. It would be better to invest in a certified, branded cable from a reliable source to ensure safety, security, and compatibility."},{"instruction":"Question: Title: Lovely and darling Review: I think this book is superb.

If the interest is increased by 3%, it would amount to how much? Options: (A) 299 (B) 277 (C) 266 (D) 992 (E) 188 Hmmm, my stream of consciousness:","output":"Let's solve the problem step by step. 1. First, we'll find the initial interest rate: Given that Rs.800 amounts to Rs.920 in 3 years at simple interest. Simple Interest (SI) = Amount (A) - Principal (P) SI = 920 - 800 SI = 120 Now, we'll use the Simple Interest formula: SI = (P * R * T) / 100 Where: P = Principal amount = Rs.800 R = Interest rate (which we want to find) T = Time period = 3 years Plugging the values: 120 = (800 * R * 3) / 100 Solving for R: 100 * 120 = 800 * R * 3 R = (100 * 120) / (800 * 3) R = 5 % 2. Now, we'll find the new amount when the interest is increased by 3%: New Interest rate = Initial interest rate + 3 % New Interest rate = 5 % + 3 % New Interest rate = 8 % Now, we use the same Simple Interest formula but with the new interest rate: SI = (P * R * T) / 100 Plugging the new values: SI = (800 * 8 * 3) / 100 SI = (24,000) / 100 SI = 240 New Amount (A) = Principal amount (P) + New Simple Interest (SI) A = 800 + 240 A = 1040 So, if the interest is increased by 3%, the new amount would be Rs.1040.

How do I satisfy the girl during sex? How do I satisfy a girl during sex?","output":"While the two questions might seem identical at first glance, they actually possess subtle differences in their meanings and implications. By examining their context, scope, and emphasis, we can better understand the nuances between the two questions. 1. \\"How do I satisfy the girl during sex?\\" This question implies that the person asking has a specific girl in mind that they are either currently in or anticipate being in a sexual relationship with. The question displays a desire to satisfy this particular girl and ensure that she experiences pleasure and enjoyment during the act. It may also suggest that the person asking is either unsure of or seeks to improve their sexual prowess for the sake of their partner. 2. \\"How do I satisfy a girl during sex?\\" Unlike the first question, this one has broader implications as it pertains to satisfying any girl during sex, rather than focusing on a specific person. The person asking may be seeking general advice and strategies to employ in various sexual encounters, regardless of the relationship they have with the girl involved. It could also indicate a more inexperienced individual trying to gather information before entering into the realm of sexual relationships. Now, let's offer a detailed and thoughtful response addressing both questions, keeping in mind their unique nuances: To satisfy both the girl or a girl during sex, you should consider the following: 1. Communication: Open lines of communication are vital for understanding and catering to your partner's desires and needs. Discuss sexual preferences, boundaries, and what may or may not feel good. 2. Consent: Always ensure you have your partner's consent and make respect and trust the foundation of your sexual encounters. 3. Foreplay: Being attentive during foreplay is an effective way of tending to your partner's physical and emotional needs. Focus on gentle touches, kisses, caresses, and massages to help build anticipation. 4. Be attentive to her body language: Pay close attention to nonverbal cues, such as her breathing, movements, and vocal expressions, which can indicate if she is enjoying herself or if you should alter your approach. 5. Sexual techniques: Learn various sexual techniques and positions, ensuring that those practiced are pleasurable for your partner. Be open to trying new things, keeping in mind your partner's comfort and preferences. 6. Emotional connection: Going beyond physical signals, maintain an emotional connection with your partner to enhance intimacy. This can create a more satisfying sexual experience for both parties. 7. Aftercare: A satisfying sexual experience extends beyond the act itself. Ensure you tend to your partner's emotional well-being afterward by cuddling, conversing, or demonstrating affectionate gestures. Ultimately, the key to satisfying a partner in any sexual endeavor lies in open communication, respect, and understanding individual needs and preferences. While the two questions mentioned earlier hold nuances in scope and context, the general approach to fulfilling the desires of a specific girl or any girl, should follow these principles."},{"instruction":"Dempsey was born in Lewiston, Maine, and grew up in the nearby towns of Turner and Buckfield. He has two older sisters and a half-brother, Shane. His mother, Amanda (nee Casson), was a school secretary, and his father, William, was an insurance salesman. He attended Buckfield High School and St. Dominic Regional High School. Dempsey made a number of featured appearances in television in the 1990s; he was cast several times in pilots that were not picked up for a full season, including lead roles in the TV versions of the films The Player and About A Boy. However, he received good reviews as he portrayed real-life mob boss, Meyer Lansky in 1991 when Mobsters was put on the screen.

This includes rising temperatures, more extreme weather events, shifts in ecosystems and habitats, impacts on agriculture and food production, and increased risks to human health and wellbeing. As greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), accumulate in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, they trap heat radiating from the Earth. This causes the planet to retain more energy than it releases, resulting in global warming. As the Earth's temperature continues to rise, the overall climate becomes more unstable, as increased energy in the atmosphere amplifies natural climate fluctuations and leads to more frequent and severe weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, storms, and flooding. This long-term climate change can significantly affect the world's ecosystems, as plants and animals struggle to adapt to these rapidly changing conditions. Shrinking polar ice caps and glaciers can lead to rising sea levels, which in turn could contribute to coastal flooding, compromising the livelihoods of those living in low-lying areas. Melting ice in polar regions also threatens the habitats of various species, such as polar bears, whose existence depends on stable ice platforms for hunting and breeding. Additionally, climate change can create new challenges for agriculture and food production. Rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns can alter the natural range, growth rate, and productivity of crops, potentially leading to reduced yields and increased dependency on irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers. These changes in turn can exacerbate issues of food scarcity, malnutrition, and economic instability in vulnerable areas. Finally, climate change can have significant implications for human health and wellbeing. Warmer temperatures can facilitate the spread of diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, that are transmitted by insects like mosquitoes. Furthermore, heatwaves can lead to dehydration, heatstroke, and cardiovascular complications, particularly among vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions. In conclusion, the final step in the process you described, which encompasses increased burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exacerbation of the greenhouse effect by carbon dioxide, culminates in a range of complex and far-reaching consequences. Ultimately, these consequences undermine the stability and sustainability of ecosystems, food production, and human health, and emphasize the pressing need for a global shift towards more sustainable resource management and mitigation strategies."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - Spacked Out (Chinese title: ; \\"Mo Yan Ka Sai\\") is a 2000 Chinese social realist film directed by Lawrence Ah Mon and produced by Johnnie To.

Which language is this?","output":"The text provided is written in Finnish, which is a member of the Uralic language family. Finnish is one of the two official languages of Finland, the other being Swedish. It is also recognized as a minority language in Sweden. The Finnish language is known for its complex grammar system and its unique vocabulary. It is not closely related to most other European languages, apart from Estonian and some lesser-known languages spoken around the Baltic Sea. Finnish employs extensive use of vowels and consonants in its terminology. Also, it's entirely phonemic, meaning there's a direct correspondence between its spelling and pronunciation. Finnish noun and adjective inflectional forms are complicated - many nominal inflections are found, with fifteen cases expressed as suffixes, and two cases are conveyed with separate prepositions or postpositions. Adding to the complexity is the Finnish verb conjugation, which comprises four tenses and mood differentiation. Also, the language features vowel harmony - a syntax system that restricts which vowels can be found near each other in a word – and consonant gradation which affects the forms a word can have when inflected. Many words in Finnish, such as \\"sisu,\\" a term that involves determination and courage, do not have a direct translation in other languages, which is another feature that makes it unique. Despite its complexity, quite a few people find the Finnish language exceedingly intriguing, and several resources are available for those wishing to learn it, ranging from textbooks to online courses.

Step 2: Understand the topic - The Cyprus dispute The Cyprus dispute is a long-standing conflict between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots on the island of Cyprus. The conflict has its roots in the 20th century when the island gained independence from British rule. It escalated in 1974 when Turkey invaded the island in response to a Greek-backed coup attempt. Step 3: Assess the impact of the dispute on Cypriot casualties Throughout the conflict, there have been several instances of violence and armed confrontations, resulting in casualties among both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The bloodiest period was during the 1974 invasion, which left hundreds dead and thousands displaced. Step 4: Compare the statement with the information gathered The statement asserts that the Cyprus dispute caused \\"thousands of Cypriot casualties.\\" While it is true that the conflict has resulted in numerous casualties, the number of dead is in the hundreds rather than thousands. However, if we consider displaced people as indirect casualties, then the number would indeed reach into the thousands. Step 5: Arrive at a conclusion While the statement might not be entirely accurate in terms of the number of deaths, it is reasonably accurate when considering the broader impact of the Cyprus dispute on the Cypriot population. Therefore, the answer is: - yes"},{"instruction":"In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.). According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Did Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu) lay great stress on the proper and harmonious relationship between parent and child?\\" is \\"No\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Did Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu) lay great stress on the proper and harmonious relationship between parent and child?\\" is \\"Yes.\\" The paragraph states that \\"Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state.\\""},{"instruction":"Select your answer: Which is this about?

He loved how fast it was! However, we piled about 5 cars into the Cyborg head and it STILL didn't come open like it should (after looking forever to find 3 more cars that would work). Also, a particular piece of the plastic track kept coming apart and I kept having to snap it back into place. After doing this about 5 times the cheap plastic gave and broke off completely. My son was very disappointed. (...) Answer:","output":"The review mentioned would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. While there are some positive aspects stated in the review, such as the enjoyment of the 6-year-old child and the successful looping of the included cars, it also highlights some significant issues with the product. One significant issue with the product is the difficulty in making the Cyborg head feature work properly. The reviewer notes that even when adding more cars than recommended, the Cyborg head still did not open as intended. This indicates that the design or mechanism of this track might be flawed or less efficient than promised, which could lead to user frustration and disappointment. Another major concern raised by the reviewer is the poor quality of the materials used in the construction of the product. The particular plastic track mentioned constantly came apart, requiring the user to reassemble it multiple times. Eventually, it broke off completely due to the cheap plastic material. This signifies that the overall quality and durability of the product are questionable, which can result in reduced playtime and enjoyment for the children using it. Furthermore, the broken track piece would likely lead to a limited and frustrating experience for the child, reducing the overall value of the product and potentially causing further disappointment once the track no longer functions as intended. Therefore, the negative aspects mentioned in the review outweigh the positive aspects, resulting in a decreased likelihood of purchasing the product."},{"instruction":"WikiAnswers - Why does helium fusion require a higher , fusion require a higher temperature than hydrogen fusion?

His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33 years old. Can we draw the following conclusion? Alphonse Gabriel Capone was well known during prohibition","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Alphonse Gabriel Capone, commonly known as Al Capone or Scarface, was well known during the Prohibition era in the United States. There are several reasons, events, and aspects of Capone's life that contribute to his notoriety and reputation during this time. 1. The Prohibition Era: The United States underwent a period of Prohibition from 1920 to 1933, during which the production, transport, and sale of alcohol were banned as a result of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Prohibition era led to a significant increase in organized crime, as criminal enterprises took advantage of the ban on alcohol to profit from the illegal production and sale of alcohol. Al Capone rose to prominence in this context, becoming a prominent figure in the world of organized crime. 2. The Chicago Outfit: Al Capone was a co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit, one of the most notorious and powerful criminal organizations in American history. The Outfit was involved in various illegal activities, such as racketeering, prostitution, gambling, and, most notably during Prohibition, the illegal production and distribution of alcohol. Capone's leadership and influence in this criminal organization earned him wide recognition and infamy. 3. The St. Valentine's Day Massacre: One of the most notorious events associated with Al Capone, even though his direct involvement was never conclusively proven, is the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. On February 14, 1929, members of the North Side Gang, rivals to Capone's Chicago Outfit, were ambushed and murdered in a garage in Chicago. The massacre was widely covered in the press and is considered one of the most infamous events in American organized crime history. 4. The Media and Al Capone: Capone's activities and lifestyle were frequently covered in the press, which only fueled his fame. His fashion-forward suits, lavish parties, and expensive cars became symbols of his criminal success, making him an infamous figure in popular culture. Capone often courted the media by presenting himself as a modern-day Robin Hood who provided for the poor by engaging in philanthropic activities, further contributing to his image as a larger-than-life figure. 5. Ultimately Convicted for Tax Evasion: Capone's criminal empire began to collapse when he was indicted and convicted on charges of tax evasion in 1931. He was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison, which he served at the then-newly opened Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. This conviction and his subsequent imprisonment only cemented Capone's image as a legendary figure in the world of crime. In conclusion, Alphonse Gabriel Capone was indeed well known during the Prohibition era due to his leadership of the Chicago Outfit, his involvement in and association with prominent illegal activities, and his highly publicized image in the media."},{"instruction":"Question 1: What is it like to be an Indian Muslim? Question 2: How does it feel to be a Indian Muslim? (A). no; (B). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Being an AI language model, I do not have personal feelings or experiences. However, I can offer an analysis of these two questions and provide a brief look into the lived experiences of Indian Muslims. Given the depth and complexity of personal experiences, it would be unfair to generalize, but I will give you an overview of some shared aspects of being an Indian Muslim. Answer to Question 1 (What is it like to be an Indian Muslim?): India has a diverse cultural landscape, and it is home to people from various religious, linguistic, and ethnic backgrounds. Muslims make up about 14% of India's total population, making them the largest religious minority in the country. The Indian Muslim community has a rich history and has contributed significantly to India's cultural, intellectual, and social development. To understand what it is like to be an Indian Muslim, one must consider factors such as family life, religious practices, food, clothing, and the influence of both Indian and Islamic traditions on key aspects of life like music, architecture, and literature. Family life in Indian Muslim households is influenced by traditional Islamic values, including the importance of strong family ties, respect for elders, and the observance of religious customs and rituals. The family structure can be nuclear or extended, but it is common for families to live closely and celebrate festivals together. Food and cuisine in Indian Muslim households often reflect a blend of Indian and Middle Eastern flavors. Iconic dishes include biryanis, kebabs, and kormas, and many families enjoy feasting on these delicacies during special occasions and festivals like Ramadan and Eid. Indian Muslims, like their counterparts in other countries, maintain their Islamic faith through regular prayers, reading the Quran, and observing religious practices in their daily lives. Many men attend mosques for congregational prayers, while women often pray at home. Festivals like Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha are celebrated with great fervor and bring families and communities together. Answer to Question 2 (How does it feel to be an Indian Muslim?): As an AI, I cannot provide a firsthand account of feelings or emotions. However, I can offer an analysis of the possible emotions and sentiments experienced by Indian Muslims. The feelings of Indian Muslims can be influenced by multiple factors, including their personal beliefs, socioeconomic background, and interactions with others within their community and broader Indian society. The experiences and emotions of individual Indian Muslims can be diverse, and there is no single answer that can encapsulate them all. However, some common themes could include: 1. Pride: Many Indian Muslims are proud of their dual heritage, which is rooted in both Indian and Islamic traditions. They may take pride in their contributions to India’s development and appreciate the unity in diversity that defines India as a nation. 2. Challenges: Like any other community, Indian Muslims sometimes face challenges related to economic, social, and educational development. They may have concerns about these issues, whether on an individual or community level, and may strive to overcome these challenges. 3. Discrimination: Some Indian Muslims may experience discrimination based on their religious beliefs or identity, which can lead to feelings of anger, sadness, or frustration. However, it is essential to note that the experiences of discrimination vary significantly among individuals, and many Indian Muslims feel accepted and welcomed in their communities. To answer your final question, while the first question focuses on the experiences and lifestyle of Indian Muslims, and the second question deals primarily with their emotions and feelings, there may be some overlap in the answers. Nevertheless, they do address different aspects of the Indian Muslim experience."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Tuvalu, a tiny island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, consists of nine low-lying islands, with its highest elevation being just about 4.5 meters above sea level. As a result, the country is particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, specifically, sea level rise, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events. These climate-induced challenges are not only threatening the fragile ecosystems of Tuvalu but also its people, economy, and infrastructure. 1. Sea level rise: Global warming and the melting of polar ice caps have contributed to the rise in sea levels, which poses an existential threat to Tuvalu. Most parts of its islands are less than one meter above sea level, making them highly vulnerable to flooding and inundation. Permanent submersion could become a reality for Tuvalu in the coming decades if sea levels continue to rise at the current rate. 2. Coast erosion: Tuvalu's sandy and low-lying atolls are experiencing increased coastal erosion due to rising sea levels and extreme weather events. The natural weakening of the coastline makes it difficult for Tuvalu to maintain its territory and preserve its cultural heritage. 3. Extreme weather events: Climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as storms, cyclones, and droughts, affecting the island nation. Such events not only cause damage to infrastructure but also impact agriculture, access to clean water, and public health. As a result of these challenges, Tuvalu faces a potential loss of land, livelihoods, and population displacement. However, the nation has not stood idle in the face of these threats and is taking various measures to combat and adapt to climate change. Some of these approaches include: 1. International advocacy: Tuvalu has been actively seeking support on the global stage, playing a prominent role in international climate change negotiations. For instance, the country played an influential role in the negotiations that led to the Paris Agreement's inclusion of a target to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 2. Climate-resilient infrastructure: Tuvalu has been focusing on constructing climate-resilient buildings and infrastructure that are more resistant to the impacts of climate change. This includes the use of elevated building designs, using materials resistant to corrosion, and adopting cyclone-proof techniques in construction. 3. Coastal protection: To manage coastline erosion, Tuvalu is investing in coastal protection measures such as the construction of seawalls, planting mangroves, and reclaiming land using dredging technologies to reinforce coastal areas. 4. Renewable energy adoption: Tuvalu has initiated plans to minimize its reliance on imported fossil fuels and transition toward renewable energy sources. The country aims to generate 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by the year 2025. 5. International partnerships: Tuvalu continues to strengthen its partnership with regional and international organizations, including the European Union, United Nations, and Pacific Islands Forum, to access financial resources, capacity-building, and technical assistance for its climate change adaptation programs. Despite these efforts, Tuvalu's future remains uncertain under the looming threat of climate change. The nation's survival relies heavily on global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and commitment to supporting vulnerable countries in their fight against climate change."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

How much time does he spend cleaning total each week? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"Aron spends time cleaning by performing two tasks: vacuuming and dusting. We can calculate the time he spends on each task individually, and then add those times together to determine the total time spent cleaning each week. Here's a step-by-step breakdown: 1. Vacuuming: Aron vacuums for 30 minutes per session, three times a week. To find out how many minutes he spends vacuuming each week in total, we can multiply the time spent on each session by the number of sessions: 30 minutes/session × 3 sessions/week = 90 minutes/week 2. Dusting: Aron spends 20 minutes per session dusting, two times a week. Similar to the vacuuming calculation, we can multiply the time spent on each session by the number of sessions to find the total time spent dusting each week: 20 minutes/session × 2 sessions/week = 40 minutes/week 3. To find the total amount of time Aron spends cleaning each week, we can add the time spent vacuuming and dusting together: 90 minutes/week (vacuuming) + 40 minutes/week (dusting) = 130 minutes/week So, Aron spends a total of 130 minutes (or 2 hours and 10 minutes) cleaning each week."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

These infants were too young to be vaccinated, and as a result they were particularly susceptible. So we vaccinated those around them to stop transmission. By 2000, a decade after my EIS experience, measles transmission in the United States was declared to have been stopped. However, we still have occasional clusters of measles in pockets of unvaccinated children after measles has been brought into the United States from somewhere else in the world. In response to these clusters, public health officials have been tirelessly working to ensure that communities are well-informed about the risks of measles and the importance of vaccinations. This has involved partnering with healthcare providers, schools, and community organizations to spread awareness and educate parents about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Outreach programs in various languages have been developed, targeting specific populations to bridge any gaps in communication and understanding. One of the main challenges faced by health officials is the spread of misinformation and myths about vaccines, which have fueled some parents' hesitancy to vaccinate their children. Combating this misinformation requires a multifaceted approach, including debunking myths through educational materials and social media campaigns, and promoting reputable sources of information, such as CDC's website and healthcare professionals, as reliable authorities on the subject. In addition to awareness campaigns and educational outreach, improving access to vaccines is a key component in preventing future measles outbreaks. This includes ensuring that vaccines are readily available to all children, regardless of their socioeconomic background or geographical location. Initiatives like the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which provides free vaccines to eligible children, help reduce financial barriers for families who may otherwise struggle to afford vaccinations. Monitoring and maintaining high vaccination rates is crucial for maintaining herd immunity, which protects individuals who cannot be vaccinated due to age, medical conditions, or other reasons. Healthcare providers play an important role in tracking vaccination records and following up with families to ensure that children receive the appropriate vaccines on schedule. In some cases, public health officials may also implement targeted vaccination drives in communities where vaccination rates are low. Lastly, international collaboration and cooperation plays a vital role in preventing the spread of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. By sharing epidemiological data, surveillance techniques, and best practices in vaccination campaigns, countries can work together to prevent outbreaks from crossing borders and ensure a rapid response when cases do emerge. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage would be to emphasize the importance of continued public health efforts to promote vaccination, combat misinformation, and improve access to vaccines. Additionally, maintaining high vaccination rates, monitoring vaccination records, and fostering international collaboration are all essential strategies for preventing future measles outbreaks. By working together, communities, healthcare providers, and public health officials can ensure that measles remains a rare and controlled disease in the United States and around the world."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period.

Answer:","output":"The winners of the men's figure skating Olympic gold have changed with each Olympic Games. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the most recent men's figure skating Olympic gold medal winner is Yuzuru Hanyu from Japan. Hanyu won the gold medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Remarkably, this victory marked Hanyu's second consecutive Olympic gold, as he had previously won the event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Yuzuru Hanyu is a highly accomplished figure skater. Over the years, he has garnered numerous accolades, displaying tremendous skill, artistry, and athleticism on the ice. Hanyu's captivating on-ice performances have been recognized and awarded across multiple international championships, including the World Figure Skating Championships, the Grand Prix of Figure Skating, and the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships. During the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Hanyu finished in first place with a total score of 280.09 points. This win was a historic moment in the world of figure skating, as Hanyu became the first Asian male skater to claim the Olympic gold, as well as the youngest winner of the men's singles event since Dick Button in 1948. At the age of 19, Hanyu stood atop the Olympic podium, with Patrick Chan from Canada and Denis Ten from Kazakhstan taking the silver and bronze medals, respectively. In the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, Yuzuru Hanyu went on to secure his place in history by becoming the first male skater to defend the Olympic gold title in 66 years (since Dick Button in 1952).

Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings.

This meant 45,500 grades have been corrected - up by 15% compared with the results of summer 2013. It represents a much bigger increase over the last few years - about 50% more grade changes than 2011. \\"We're not surprised to hear that there has been a significant increase in requests for re-marks. Many schools have told us of a worrying number of results which simply did not reflect how well students should have done,\\" said Mr Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. \\"Schools need to be able to trust the marks given to students.

The company had initially anticipated a share price in the range of 14 to 16, but investor enthusiasm prompted the company to raise that range by 3 on Wednesday. Shares are trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SHAK.” A bet on Shake Shack, a fast-casual restaurant operator with just 63 global locations, is an investment in a company that could one day become the next Chipotle CMG . Those two chains are the model that all other fast-casual chains could one day aspire to achieve. Fast-casual restaurants have menus that are filled with food that consumers perceive as healthier fare than what fast-food competitors sell, but without the table service found at casual dining chains. Though Shake Shack is growing — generating nearly 79 million in “Shack sales” for the first nine months of 2014 — there are some worries that growth at stores that have been open for at least two years has slowed. Shake Shack can be seen as more thrilling investment than McDonald’s MCD , which this week saw the resignation of its CEO after a string of poor sales. But the newer chain is also facing stiff competition from other fast-casual burger chains such as Smashburger and Five Guys. And McDonald’s, while it faces major challenges, still booked 4.8 billion in profit last year. Burger chains are in prime position, at least when it comes to prevailing trends in the restaurant world. Nine billion servings of burgers were ordered at U.S. restaurants and foodservice outlets last year, an increase of 3% from 2013, despite weakness in traffic at other restaurants, according to research firm NPD Group. That indicates the burger chains can court rising consumer interest in their core menus. History was on Shake Shack’s side when it debuted on Friday. The fast-casual chains that have debuted on the market the past decade have reported an average gain of 95% on their first day of trading, according to IPO ETF manager Renaissance Capital. If Shake Shack’s early pop holds until the end of the day, it will have reported the best first-day performance among the seven restaurant chains that have gone public over the last 10 years. Of the now seven fast-casual chains Renaissance Capital tracked, only Chipotle has been on the stock market for greater than two years. It listed in 2006 and has gained over 3,100% from its IPO price, suggesting investors are willing to place a bet on what could be the next huge concept in the category. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Shake Shack's initial public offering (IPO) and the strong investor interest in the company's shares. On the first day of trading, its stock price more than doubled, and the shares were trading at around 49 per share, which is a 133% gain above the initial offering price of 21. It discusses how Shake Shack's growth and potential to become a major player in the fast-casual restaurant sector, similar to Chipotle, attracted investors. The article also mentions concerns about the slowing growth at stores that have been open for at least two years and the competition Shake Shack faces from other fast-casual burger chains like Smashburger and Five Guys. However, the overall trend of increasing burger sales in the U.S. and the historical performance of other fast-casual chains' IPOs indicates investor optimism in the company."},{"instruction":"Given the question: How can people acquire things they desire? - riots - wait in line - suffer pain - bank money - believe in god The best answer is The answer is:","output":"People can acquire things they desire through various means, such as earning money, waiting in line, or having strong beliefs.

Please remove spaces between words.","output":"Certainly! It seems that you would like information about CD-ROMs, their inclusion in the price, and the removal of spaces between words. I'll gladly provide a detailed explanation on these topics. A CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) is an optical disc used for storing data and files. It was introduced in the 1980s as a means to distribute software, media, and other digital content. CD-ROMs quickly gained popularity because they offered a significant increase in storage capacity (up to 700MB) compared to floppy disks, which could only store a few MB of data. This technology revolutionized the way software and multimedia content were distributed, as it allowed manufacturers to provide much larger files, applications, and media like audio and video to users more efficiently. When it comes to pricing and CD-ROM inclusion, this is often dependent on the specific product or software you are purchasing. In some cases, the price of the product already includes a CD-ROM containing the required software or files. This can be a convenient option for those who prefer physical copies or lack a reliable internet connection for downloading the necessary files. It's also worth mentioning that nowadays, the use of CD-ROMs has significantly declined since more people prefer digital downloads or streaming, leading to the emergence of alternative media storage and distribution methods like USB flash drives, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, and cloud-based services. As for your request to remove spaces between words, I presume you are referring to a text or message you would like to display without spaces. Let me provide a sample for you: Original text: \\"No comments! CD-ROM is included to the price.\\" Without spaces: \\"Nocomments!CD-ROMisincludedtotheprice.\\" Removing spaces between words makes the text harder to read, as it eliminates the visual cue that normally indicates a separation between distinct words. This is not a common practice as it can hinder communication and understanding. However, there might be specific situations where removing spaces is necessary, for instance, in code or compression algorithms. In conclusion, a CD-ROM is an essential medium for storing and distributing data, and its inclusion in the price of a product depends on the specific deal or package being offered. Removing spaces between words, although not typical, could be useful in select circumstances but may obstruct the clarity of the text."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: United Kingdom CAPITAL London.

He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - George Harrison, (25 February 1943 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. - Sir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. - The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the Western world between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the American Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and became revolutionary with the expansion of the US government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born, catalyzed, or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s. - \\"Beatlemania\\" is a term that originated and was coined during the early 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed towards the English rock band the Beatles. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966. - The Beatles ' Hits EP was released 6 September 1963 . It is The Beatles second British EP and was only released in mono , with the catalogue number Parlophone GEP 8880 . This EP can be seen as an early example of a greatest hits release . It was also released in Australia and New Zealand . - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music.

Given the question \\"How would Lee feel as a result?\\", is \\"helpful to a friend\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"The answer \\"helpful to a friend\\" does not directly address the question \\"How would Lee feel as a result?\\". In order to provide a valid long and detailed response, we can analyze what emotions Lee might experience due to Alex serving Lee's apprenticeship on his behalf. 1. Gratitude: Lee would likely feel a strong sense of gratitude towards Alex for stepping in and completing his apprenticeship when he was unable to do so himself. This act of kindness demonstrates the depth of Alex's character and care for Lee as a friend, and it would be natural for Lee to appreciate and be thankful for this assistance. 2. Relief: If Lee was unable to complete the apprenticeship due to external factors, such as illness, family issues, or some form of personal difficulty, having Alex step in would provide a sense of relief. Lee would probably be concerned about the potential negative consequences of not being able to complete the apprenticeship, and the fact that Alex was able to help would ease those worries and stress. 3. Guilt: While Lee would be grateful for the assistance, it's possible that he might feel a sense of guilt over Alex having to shoulder the burden of his apprenticeship. The responsibilities and commitments involved in an apprenticeship can be substantial, and Lee might be worried about the impact this could have on Alex's own life or the potential strain it might place on their friendship. 4. Inspired: Lee could be motivated and inspired by Alex's actions, finding new determination to overcome whatever obstacles prevented him from doing the apprenticeship in the first place. This inspiration might manifest in a desire to reciprocate the kindness shown by Alex, either by supporting him in his own endeavors or by making a conscious effort to be more supportive to others in general. 5. Stronger Friendship: With Alex going above and beyond to support Lee, it's likely that the bond between the two friends would grow even stronger. Events like this can serve as a reminder of the value and depth of their friendship, leading to a greater mutual sense of trust, loyalty, and camaraderie. In conclusion, while the answer \\"helpful to a friend\\" does touch upon the theme of friendship and support between Alex and Lee, it doesn't specifically address the feelings that Lee might experience as a result of Alex serving his apprenticeship. A more valid and detailed response would include analyzing the various emotions that Lee might go through, such as gratitude, relief, guilt, inspiration, and a stronger sense of friendship."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

It took place from December 7 to 19, 1972, and marked the end of the Apollo program, which remains the only time humans have visited the moon. Apollo 17 was a significant mission in many ways. It was specifically selected to have a crew of experienced astronauts, consisting of Commander Eugene Cernan, Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans, and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt. Schmitt, a professional geologist, would be the first scientist to visit another celestial body. Having a trained scientist onboard allowed for more comprehensive research during the lunar surface activities. The mission had a number of scientific objectives, including geological surveys, lunar sampling, and deploying scientific experiments. The crew spent approximately 75 hours on the lunar surface, taking part in three moonwalks in the Taurus-Littrow valley. They covered a total distance of approximately 35 kilometers (22 miles) in the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV). The astronauts collected various rock and soil samples from different locations, including some samples that were over 4 billion years old. During their time on the moon, the crew set up a number of instruments as part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). These instruments were designed to study the lunar environment, with specific focus on seismology, heat flow, and the effect of lunar dust on different materials. Many of these experiments continued to provide valuable data for several years after the mission. In addition to their scientific activities, the Apollo 17 crew took a series of iconic photographs, including the famous \\"Blue Marble\\" image of Earth. This photograph was taken by the crew while they were approximately 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) away from Earth, and it remains one of the most famous images of our planet. Once the crew finished their activities on the lunar surface, they returned to the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) in lunar orbit. The entire crew safely splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on December 19, 1972, marking the end of the Apollo program and the last manned lunar mission to date. In the decades since Apollo 17, human space exploration has focused on Earth orbit and the development of technology to facilitate long-duration space flight. While proposals for future manned lunar missions have been discussed, no concrete plans have been carried out. However, recent endeavors, such as NASA's Artemis program, aim to send humans back to the moon and even beyond, to explore Mars and other destinations in our solar system."},{"instruction":"Read the bio below and try to give details on chip minton 's: - birth name - retired - billed - name - trainer - names Bio: nathan \`\` chip '' minton iii -lrb- born june 9 , 1969 -rrb- is an american former bobsledder and former professional wrestler . he is best known for his participation in the winter olympics in 1994 and 1998 , where he represented the united states ' bobsleigh team . he is also known for his brief stint in world championship wrestling from 1998 to 1999 .

There are no dance schools in Glenwood and Lauryn says goodbye to her brother, Joel (John Reardon) before departing for Chicago to audition for a famous dance school, the fictional Chicago School of Music and Dance. Although Joel, who works as a mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage. Before locking up late one night, Lauryn goes on the stage and silently and elegantly dances, while unbeknownest to her, Russ watches from a distance. The next night, Brenda finds herself short of dancers. Russ asks Lauryn to dance, after having seen her graceful performance the previous night. Lauryn reluctantly agrees, and goes on stage. At first, new to the sexy routine, Lauryn looks foolish, but when Russ starts playing hip-hop music, Lauryn does a sexy hip-hop routine, and finds herself to be Ruby's new star.

Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\". - The Amazon River (or ; Spanish and ) in South America is the largest river by discharge of water in the world, and according to some experts, the longest in length. The headwaters of the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazons most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the Cordillera Rumi Cruz at the headwaters of the Mantaro River in Peru. The Mantaro and Apurímac confluence, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn confluences with the Marañón River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon.

It may breathe air or extract its oxygen from that dissolved in water through specialised organs called gills, or directly through its skin. Natural environments and the animals that live in them can be categorized as aquatic (water) or terrestrial (land). - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy. - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.

They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - Colombia (or ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process that leads to earthquakes is the formation and growth of fault lines. Fault lines are fractures or zones of weakness in the Earth's crust, where tectonic forces cause the lithosphere to break apart or move relative to one another. These tectonic forces are driven by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, which are constantly shifting and interacting with each other. Since the Earth's crust is made up of a mosaic of rigid plates that are floating on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below, this movement can create stress and strain along the plate boundaries. There are three main types of fault lines: normal, reverse, and strike-slip. Normal faults occur when the Earth's crust is being pulled apart, and one block of rock slips downwards relative to the other. Reverse faults, on the other hand, occur when the Earth's crust is being compressed, causing one block of rock to be pushed upwards relative to the other. Finally, strike-slip faults occur when two blocks of rocks slide past one another horizontally. Over time, as the tectonic plates continue to move, the stresses and strains along the fault lines increase. The rocks on each side of the fault lines are subjected to different forces, causing them to deform and change shape. Eventually, the stresses become too great for the rocks to handle, and they begin to rub against one another. This rubbing or grinding action between the rocks generates friction, which in turn generates heat and pressure. As the pressure builds, the rocks eventually break or slip, releasing the built-up energy in the form of seismic waves. These waves travel through the Earth's crust and cause the ground to shake, which is what we experience as an earthquake. In summary, the first step of the process that leads to earthquakes is the formation and growth of fault lines due to tectonic forces acting upon the Earth's crust. This creates zones of weakness where stress and strain accumulate over time, eventually causing the rocks to deform, rub against one another, and ultimately break, releasing the energy stored as seismic waves that cause the ground to shake."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: who won the college football national championship in 2016?","output":"The College Football National Championship in 2016 was won by the University of Alabama Crimson Tide. The 2016 title match, also known as the College Football Playoff National Championship for the 2015 season, took place at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona on January 11, 2016, and it was the second-ever College Football Playoff National Championship game. The game featured the Clemson University Tigers, who were the #1 ranked team at the conclusion of the 2015 regular season, and the University of Alabama Crimson Tide, who were ranked #2. The Tigers were led by head coach Dabo Swinney and had an outstanding season with a record of 14-0, including an ACC Championship victory over the University of North Carolina. Meanwhile, the Crimson Tide were led by head coach Nick Saban and had a record of 13-1, coming off a dominant victory over the Michigan State Spartans in the Cotton Bowl Classic, which served as one of the College Football Playoff semifinals. The National Championship game was an exciting, back-and-forth contest, with Clemson's high-powered offense led by quarterback Deshaun Watson going up against Alabama's dominant defense anchored by players like defensive lineman Jonathan Allen and linebacker Reggie Ragland. Though Clemson put up a great fight and Watson threw for over 400 yards against the vaunted Alabama defense, it was the running of Alabama's Derrick Henry and the defense and special teams units that made the difference, contributing key plays to tilt the game in favor of the Crimson Tide. Alabama's offensive standout, Derrick Henry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner, rushed for 158 yards and scored three touchdowns, including a 50-yard touchdown run in the first quarter that set the tone for the Crimson Tide's offensive scheme. Meanwhile, Alabama's defense and special teams came up with essential plays, most notably the 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Kenyan Drake and a critical onside kick recovery by Marlon Humphrey in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, Alabama emerged victorious with a 45-40 win over Clemson, securing the school's 16th national championship and further solidifying the legacy of head coach Nick Saban, who won his fifth national title and fourth with Alabama, marking him as one of college football's all-time best coaches. The game's Offensive MVP award went to Alabama's tight end O.J. Howard, who had a breakout performance with 208 receiving yards and two touchdown catches, while the Defensive MVP was awarded to Crimson Tide's defensive back Eddie Jackson, who contributed with key tackles and pass breakups."},{"instruction":"Stavros Dimas herättää luottamusta, mutta hän näyttää olevan kiinnostuneempi elinkeinopolitiikasta kuin ympäristöpolitiikasta.

The Perfect Storm, directed by John Catastrophe, is a science-fiction action-thriller that miserably attempts to captivate its audience by merging substandard visual effects with an embarrassingly clichéd plot. Step 2: Discuss the plot and major themes without revealing too much Justification: Briefly explaining the plot without spoilers will help the reader understand the critic's perspective on the film's direction and execution. The story revolves around a group of seemingly invincible and cocky warriors who fight against time and space anomalies caused by a villainous, power-hungry madman. While the intention may have been to create suspenseful challenges for the heroes to overcome, the plot quickly becomes absurd as predictability suffocates viewer engagement. Step 3: Criticize the characters and acting performances Justification: Analyzing characters and acting is crucial in a movie review, as it highlights the depth (or lack thereof) in the portrayal of key figures. The characters, who are supposed to be relatable and sympathetic, are instead one-dimensional and forgettable. Even seasoned actors like Jane Lead and Joe Sidekick struggle to deliver convincing performances, as they are bogged down by stilted dialogue and poorly-developed character arcs. Step 4: Point out flaws in the film's technical aspects Justification: Examining the technical elements, such as special effects and cinematography, is essential as they contribute substantially to the movie-watching experience. Visually, \\"The Perfect Storm\\" is a mess. The dystopian world fails to awe the viewer, as cheap CGI effects repeatedly shatter suspension of disbelief. The action sequences, which might have partially saved the film, are instead unexciting and clumsily directed. Step 5: Comment on other aspects like soundtrack and editing Justification: Addressing the movie's soundtrack and editing helps paint a more comprehensive picture of the film's overall quality. Even the film's soundtrack is forgettable, failing to heighten the tension in key moments or evoke any emotions. The disjointed editing further contributes to the film's overall lack of coherence and pacing. Step 6: Conclude with a summary and recommendation Justification: Wrapping up the review with a summary and recommendation helps the reader understand the critic's final opinion on the movie. In conclusion, \\"The Perfect Storm\\" is a prime example of a cinematic disaster riddled with plot, character, and technical shortcomings. Unless one is seeking to embark on a two-hour marathon of predictable tropes and lackluster visuals, it is highly recommended to steer clear of this cinematic catastrophe."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"A woman looks over the shoulder of a street food vendor in a crowded marketplace.\\" that \\"A woman wants to buy fruit in the market.\\"?

Which board game was released first, Stonehenge or Elfenland? The answer is:","output":"Elfenland was released first. Elfenland is a board game designed by Alan R. Moon and was first published in 1998 by Amigo Spiele and Rio Grande Games. The game is set in a fantasy world where players control elves traveling through a landscape with different terrains, trying to visit as many of their homeland cities as possible within four turns. On the other hand, Stonehenge is a board game designed by Richard Berg, released in 2009 by Artbox. The game is based on the famous prehistoric monument located in Wiltshire, England. The players are druids competing for control over the powerful ley lines that run through the site, using strategy and tactics to outwit their opponents. In summary, Elfenland was released in 1998, while Stonehenge was released in 2009. Therefore, Elfenland was released first."},{"instruction":"Title: Horrible read Product review: Being a vegan, I was excited to pick up the book. I haven't read a horrible book in a long time, and was disappointed to realize this was probably the worst book I have ever read.

She needs just over 50% of the vote to win. There are 200 students in the school. 60% of students are boys and the rest are girls. If she receives 67.5% of male vote, what is the smallest percentage of the female she must receive to win the election? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's break the problem down step by step: 1. Determine the number of boys and girls in the school. Since there are 200 students in the school and 60% are boys: Number of boys = 0.6 * 200 = 120 As the remaining students are girls: Number of girls = 200 - 120 = 80 2. Calculate the minimum number of votes June needs to win the election. To win, June needs just over 50% of the vote. To ensure it is strictly over 50%, we can think of it as needing 50% + 1 vote: Minimum votes needed = 0.5 * 200 + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101 votes 3. Calculate the number of male votes June will receive with 67.5% of the male vote. Male votes received = 0.675 * 120 = 81 4. Determine the minimum number of female votes needed for June to surpass the winning threshold. Minimum female votes needed = Minimum votes needed - Male votes received = 101 - 81 = 20 5. Calculate the smallest percentage of female votes June must receive to win the election. Minimum female vote percentage = (Minimum female votes needed / Number of girls) * 100 Minimum female vote percentage = (20 / 80) * 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25% So, June needs to receive at least 25% of the female vote to win the election."},{"instruction":"Comisia pentru libertăți civile este ferm convinsă că ar trebui să analizăm ceea ce se întâmplă de fapt în prezent în jurul nostru și că trebuie să ne îmbunătățim capacitățile de a face cheltuieli în domeniul protecției refugiaților, precum și în domeniul integrării romilor.

Her case became highly publicized due to the graphic nature of the crime, which entailed her corpse having been mutilated and severed at the waist. A native of Boston, Short had spent her early life in Massachusetts and Florida before relocating to California, where her father lived. On the morning of January 15, 1947, Short's naked body was found severed in two pieces on a vacant lot on the west side of South Norton Avenue, midway between Coliseum Street and West 39th Street (at 34.0164degN 118.333degW / 34.0164; -118.333) in Leimert Park, Los Angeles. At the time, the neighborhood was largely undeveloped. Local resident Betty Bersinger discovered the body at approximately 10:00 a.m. while she was walking with her three-year-old daughter. Bersinger initially thought she had found a discarded store mannequin. When she realized it was a corpse, she rushed to a nearby house and telephoned the police. Short's severely mutilated body was completely severed at the waist and drained entirely of blood, leaving its skin a pallid white. Medical examiners determined that she had been dead for around ten hours prior to the discovery, leaving her time of death either sometime during the evening of January 14, or the early morning hours of January 15. The body obviously had been washed by the killer. Her face had been slashed from the corners of her mouth to her ears, creating an effect known as the \\"Glasgow smile\\". Short had several cuts on her thigh and breasts, where entire portions of flesh had been sliced away. The lower half of her body was positioned a foot away from the upper, and her intestines had been tucked neatly beneath her buttocks. The corpse had been \\"posed\\", with her hands over her head, her elbows bent at right angles, and her legs spread apart. Upon the discovery, a crowd of both passersby and reporters began to gather; Los Angeles Herald-Express reporter Aggie Underwood was among the first to arrive at the scene, and took several photos of the corpse and crime scene. Near the body, detectives located a heel print on the ground amid the tire tracks, and a cement sack containing watery blood was also found nearby.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. Question: What bad effect does being busy bring? Options: - Feeling important and productive - not enough information - Success in your field - Self-neglect === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"The correct answer is 'Self-neglect'. A busy, frenetic lifestyle often leads to self-neglect due to the constant drive to take on more challenges and the ongoing stream of urgent tasks. This state of continuous pushing, rushing, and fulfilling responsibilities often overshadows the less immediate but critical needs of one's life, creating a pervasive, harmful impact on various aspects of life, specifically physical, mental, and emotional well-being. When individuals become excessively busy, crucial elements of daily life, such as a balanced diet, sleep, relaxation, and self-care, often become secondary, leading to their neglect. One common example is the diet; constant busyness can render people unable to prepare nutritious meals, pushing them toward convenience foods, frozen meals, take-outs, and fast food. Such eating habits are associated with a plethora of health issues as these foods are typically high in additives, sugars, fats, and empty calories and offer minimal nutritional value. Moreover, consistent hurriedness and busyness also lead to disruptive sleep patterns and limited spare time for relaxation or deep breaths. This lack of rest and relaxation can cumulatively result in a heightened level of stress, anxiety, and various other health implications, creating a vicious cycle of self-neglect. The mental and emotional well-being of individuals can also suffer significantly. With zero or limited time devoted to self-care and relaxation, they may start to lose sight of their initial success intentions, leading to diminished overall life satisfaction. Consequently, the perceived sense of accomplishment and importance that comes from being perpetually busy may soon be outweighed by the negative effects of self-neglect on overall life quality and enjoyment. Therefore, while it might initially seem that being busy results in feelings of importance and productivity, the long-term effects can lead to the manifestation of self-neglect at various levels."},{"instruction":"Hoping to take out their frustration from the previous week's performance, where they gave up a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter and lost to the Giants, the Eagles flew to the West Coast to take on the San Francisco 49ers.

In the second quarter, the 49ers would get on the board with kicker Joe Nedney kicking a 48-yard field goal, but the Eagles made sure to stay as far away as possible, with Brian Westbrook making a spectacular 71-yard TD run, along with kicker David Akers booting a 21-yard field goal.

The emphasis on 'pedagogic renovation' is made clearer through the use of commas, and the grand aspiration of the organisation which is 'to elevate Spanish culture' is emphasized.

Clarity: In terms of clarity, the review is fairly straightforward with the reviewer sharing their positivity towards the subject in question. They simply state, \\"I love it.\\" The reader can derive that the individual had a positive experience and recommends it. Therefore, the clarity of this review can be rated as a 4. 2. Expressiveness: The review is not particularly expressive, as it conveys a simple and concise sentiment without much elaboration or detail. In order to be more expressive, it would have been helpful to know more about the reasons behind the individual's love for the subject being reviewed. Additionally, a more expressive review could contain insights on specific aspects that stood out or offered a unique experience. Considering these factors, the expressiveness of this review can be rated as a 2. 3. Helpfulness: In terms of helpfulness, the review falls short. While \\"I love it\\" is certainly a positive and reassuring statement, it does not provide readers with enough information to make an informed decision based on the review alone. Ideally, a helpful review would point out the advantages and disadvantages of the subject, how it met the reviewer's expectations, or how it compares to similar subjects in the market. As it stands, the helpfulness of this review can be rated as a 2. Taking all these factors into account and averaging the scores, this review would be rated a 2.67. Since ratings generally range between whole numbers, rounding down to the nearest whole number would give this review a rating of 2 out of 5.

Hypothesis: Some shallow-minded or unobservant people see her as a bimbo. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Analyzing the task, I am asked to verify if the premise entails the hypothesis. To complete this task, I will compare the information given in the premise with the statement made in the hypothesis and assess whether or not the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise according to the principles of logical entailment. In the premise, it is stated that: \\"She is very well spoken, has a good job, and is not a bimbo by any stretch of the imagination.\\" This statement provides a sensible and positive view of the person in question - that she is articulate, professionally successful and not unintelligent or frivolous, the characteristics often associated with the term 'bimbo'. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states: \\"Some shallow-minded or unobservant people see her as a bimbo.\\" While the two statements do involve the same woman and the concept of her being viewed as a 'bimbo', it's important to note that the premise does not entail or necessarily lead to the hypothesis. We have no information in the premise about any shallow-minded or unobservant people's perceptions of her, the hypothesis is therefore a new, additional piece of information and not a logical consequence of the premise. So, to conclude, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The reasoning behind this conclusion is grounded in the fact that the premise does not provide any details related to how others perceive her and as such, the hypothesis introduces new elements – shallow-minded or unobservant people and their potentially flawed perspective – which are not contained or implied in the premise."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

In the beginning of the movie, he lures his girlfriend, Debbie, to a secluded alley where he and another gang member gang rape her. He leads his gang into robbing and torturing a very sick pensioner, and then steps up to doing a murder-for-hire at the behest of a local drug dealer, unaware of the enormous risks. Manny and Concetta, a young couple, are desperately trying to rise out of poverty and care for their sick baby. Manny works two jobsâthe front desk of a drug-riddled flop house by day and the cash register of a frequently-robbed bodega at night. It hardly matters that he is working so hard because the baby's non-stop crying will not allow him to sleep. Another young couple, Marybeth and Benny, are both drug addicts. Marybeth is a transgender woman who makes a bit of money as a street prostitute to pay for surgery, and Benny is into very low-paying burglaries. Their principal source of drugs is a well-off transvestite, Ridley, who is looking to follow in Marybeth's footsteps. Young Willy and younger Susie are the much-neglected children of an addict named Mommy, who makes them sleep on the floor of their one-room apartment. Mommy's current boyfriend, a hot-tempered addict named Chaz, makes the children beg on the street for his drug money. Willy's one bright spot is neighbor child Melody, whose mother pimps her out every night. When Chaz and Mommy leave the children behind while they embark on a drug-fueled quest to get more drug money from a relative of Chaz, and Melody is picked up by the police.

Labour MP Steve McCabe requested an inquiry last year after it was reported that a business Mr Schapps co-founded was selling ‘plagiarising’ software which helps firms boost profits by breaching Google’s rules. The company, HowToCorp, was set up by Mr Shapps using an alias, Michael Green, and his wife Belinda, who now runs it.

This decision has sparked an outcry amongst critics who argue that the lack of investigative action highlights an underlying bias towards protecting prominent political figures, as well as a failure on the part of law enforcement to hold all individuals accountable for their business conduct, regardless of their political affiliations or status."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: What do some plants produce that protects dormant seeds and aids in their dispersal? Choices: - roots - leaves - stems - fruit A: Answer:","output":"Given the provided information in the paragraph, the correct choice is: fruit. Some plants produce fruits that protect dormant seeds and aid in their dispersal. Fruits serve several functions in the life cycle of a plant. Firstly, they protect the seeds, which contain the genetic material of the plant, during their dormant period. The outer layers of the fruit provide a physical barrier against various environmental threats such as harsh weather conditions, predators, and diseases. Additionally, they often contain organic acids and other compounds that can deter herbivores and pathogens from consuming or infecting the seeds. Secondly, fruits aid in the dispersal of seeds, which is essential for the survival and propagation of the plant species. Seed dispersal can occur through various mechanisms, such as wind, water, and animal consumption. Fleshy fruits, like berries and drupes, are attractive to animals due to their colorful appearance, sweet taste, and nutritive value. When animals eat these fruits, the seeds inside are often undigested and are eventually excreted away from the parent plant. This helps to reduce competition for resources among offspring, promotes genetic diversity, and allows the plant species to colonize new areas. In contrast, roots, leaves, and stems are vital parts of a plant, but they do not serve the same purpose as fruit in terms of protecting and dispersing seeds. Roots anchor the plant to the ground and absorb water and nutrients from the soil. Leaves are responsible for photosynthesis, the process through which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth. Stems provide structural support and act as conduits for the transport of water, minerals, and nutrients between the roots and the leaves. While these structures play essential roles in a plant's life cycle, they are not directly involved in seed protection and dispersal like fruits."},{"instruction":"What is a shorter version of this: cypriot government stressed monday that it would be willing to discuss confidence building measures on the island as long as they would not lead to the recognition of the breakaway regime in northern cyprus .

Translate this to English?","output":"Sherry Rehman, a courageous politician who proposed amendments to the blasphemy law, is in particular danger. Sherry Rehman is a prominent Pakistani politician who has demonstrated bravery and steadfastness in her stance against the country's controversial blasphemy laws. These laws, in place since the 1980s, have often been used to target religious minorities and stifle dissent. Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in Pakistan, with even accusations of disrespecting Islam causing public outrage and potentially leading to violence or acts of retribution. In Pakistan, the blasphemy laws carry strict penalties, with offences ranging from a fine to life imprisonment, or even a death sentence in cases that involve the defamation of Prophet Muhammad. These laws have been criticized by human rights organizations and international bodies for being too vague, overly broad, and prone to abuse. Rehman, a former journalist and an active member of Pakistan's political scene, has been a prominent advocate for change in these laws. In her time as a politician, she has become a respected figure, known for her dedication to human rights, democracy, and social justice issues. However, her progressive stance on controversial issues like the blasphemy law puts her at significant risk, as hardline religious conservatives view such reform efforts as an attack on their beliefs. As a consequence, Rehman has faced serious threats to her safety and well-being, including death threats from radical elements within Pakistan. In the past, similar cases involving advocates for change to the blasphemy laws have led to violence and even murder, further highlighting the dangers that outspoken critics like Rehman face. Despite the risks, Sherry Rehman continues to be a strong voice in the fight for reform and modernization in Pakistan's legal and political landscape. Her unwavering commitment to social justice and human rights demonstrates tremendous courage in the face of the dangers surrounding her."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the cat that causes Mammy to fall off of the chair?

A report by the Bank of Scotland interviewed over 1,000 young people in Britain and found that 77% get pocket money. Different families give different amounts of pocket money. The average for eight-to-fifteen-year-olds in the UK is about PS6 a week. Children in Scotland receive slightly more than the national average and Londoners get the most. Teenagers, logically, get more money than younger children. Some fifteen-to-nineteen-year-olds receive more than PS100 a month. The report found that many children save at least a quarter of their weekly pocket money and that more boys than girls save their money. Lots of young people have to do housework to get their pocket money. They help at home with jobs like cleaning and cooking. A part-time job is a choice for teenagers who don't have pocket money or who want to earn extra money. About 15% of teenagers have a job. Popular part-time jobs for teenagers include delivering newspapers, shop work, and working in a restaurant or cafe. There are strict government laws about working hours. Only children over 13 can work (there are some exceptions, for example, for actors.) On a school day they can work a maximum of 2 hours a day but not during school hours. At weekends and during school holidays they can work longer hours. The national minimum wage for people aged 16-17 is PS3.57 per hour. 18-year-olds must earn a minimum of PS4.83.

About 5,000 of them were Lithuanians. Three divisions were employed: Pskov division , International Division , and 17th Division . The divisions did not have a common military commander. Later more units were sent from Russia. The soviets also recruited partisan groups behind the front lines. Soviet soldiers were poorly supplied and had to support themselves by requisitioning food, horses, and clothes from local residents. Lithuania could not offer serious resistance as at the time its army consisted only of about 3,000 untrained volunteers. Only local partisans, armed with weapons acquired from retreating Germans, offered brief resistance. Red Army captured one town after another: Zarasai and Švenčionys , Utena , Rokiškis , Vilnius , Ukmergė and Panevėžys , Šiauliai , Telšiai . That accounted for about ⅔ of the Lithuanian territory. The front somewhat stabilized when Soviet forces were stopped near the Venta River by Latvian and German units . Also Germans slowed down withdrawal of their troops after the Spartacist uprising was subdued on January 12. Southern Lithuania was a little better protected as Germans retreated from Ukraine through Hrodna. To prevent fights between retreating Germans and the Red Army, the Soviets and Germans signed a treaty on January 18. The treaty drew a temporary demarcation line that went through Daugai, Stakliškės, and 10 kilometres east of Kaišiadorys-Jonava-Kėdainiai railway. That barred Bolshevik forces from directly attacking Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city. The Red Army would need to encircle Kaunas and attack through Alytus or Kėdainiai. The operation to take Kaunas began on February 7. Question: What happened first Soviet troops approached Lithuania or Soviet troops took 2/3rds of Lithuania? Answer:","output":"The first thing that happened was Soviet troops approached Lithuania. This happened on December 12, 1918. After they approached, they began capturing towns and eventually took about 2/3rds of the Lithuanian territory."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"The guy in the blue shirt and jeans performs a grab trick on his skateboard.\\" can we conclude that \\"A guy is riding his bike to school.\\"?

The most appropriate location depends on the circumstances and the function the car is serving at any given time. However, a car's primary purpose is to transport passengers and goods from one location to another. Therefore, in general, a car belongs on the road where it can fulfill this role most effectively. Let's consider each of the proposed locations in more detail: 1. Airports: A car can be useful at an airport for various purposes. It can be used by airport staff for transportation within the premises, for providing shuttle services to travelers, or for pick up and drop off by visitors. However, its presence at the airport is secondary to its primary function of being a mode of transport on the roads. 2. Repair shops: Over time, vehicle maintenance and repair become necessary to ensure the car functions at its optimum level. While a car might spend time at a repair shop, it is not its primary location. Repair shops are where a car goes for periodic maintenance or to undergo repairs when needed. 3. Race tracks: Cars designed for racing or high-performance vehicles may frequent race tracks to participate in races, test their performance, or for recreational purposes. While it certainly belongs on a race track, it is essential to keep in mind that not every car is designed or intended for racing. A typical car belongs on the road and not on a race track. 4. Freeways: Freeways, highways, and expressways are all types of roads designed to accommodate a large volume of high-speed traffic. Cars undoubtedly belong on these routes since they facilitate faster and more efficient transportation for long distances. However, the car also belongs on other roads, such as city streets, residential areas, and country roads, as it is designed to navigate various types of terrains and situations. In conclusion, while there are multiple locations where a car can be found or used, the most accurate answer is that a car belongs on the road. Roads are the primary locations where cars can effectively perform their primary function of transportation and serve their intended purpose for occupants. Other locations, such as airports, repair shops, race tracks, and freeways, have their significance and roles, but ultimately it is the road that best represents the natural habitat for cars."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Which is why the grass is called elephant grass.\\"? OPTIONS: -- yes; -- it is not possible to tell; -- no;","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"The grass is so high, anything in the grass can only be seen from the height of an elephant's back. Which is why the grass is called elephant grass.\\" based on the given information. The name \\"elephant grass\\" can be attributed to the height of the grass and its relation to the ability to spot other creatures from atop an elephant. Elephant grass is a common name for Pennisetum purpureum, a species of tall grass native to Africa that is often found along rivers and in wet areas. This grass grows rapidly and can reach impressive heights, sometimes towering around 3 to 4 meters (10-13 ft), which is taller than an average adult elephant. The grass got its nickname \\"elephant grass\\" because elephants, which are significantly taller than most other land animals, walk through the tall grass, creating pathways that are visible from above. The given information states that various wildlife, including rhinos, deer, and other creatures, live and hide in the tall elephant grass within the park, and most of them are accustomed to the presence of elephants and do not flee from them. Therefore, riding atop an elephant may allow individuals to observe these animals from a better vantage point, as they might not be easily seen through the dense grass from a lower perspective. The height of an adult elephant provides a vantage point that is high enough to see over the tall grass, allowing a clearer view of the park's wildlife. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to say that the grass is called \\"elephant grass\\" because it is so tall that only from the height of an elephant's back can other animals hidden in the grass be spotted. Additionally, many of these animals are accustomed to the presence of elephants and do not flee from them, making the height of an elephant the ideal perspective from which to view these elusive creatures."},{"instruction":"The answer to the question: What number did the album that the Playlouder critic believed was better than Iowa peak at on the Canadian sales charts? is inside the article: Critical reception to Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses was generally positive.

So one sunny day, the lady decided to play basketball instead of going bowling with her friends. Basketball is a game where you throw a big orange ball into a round ring called the hoop. The lady liked this game because the ball was lighter and easier for her to throw. She was excited to practice bouncing the ball and trying to make it go through the hoop. On the basketball court, she met a friendly girl named Tina. Tina was really good at basketball and offered to help the lady practice her skills. They started by practicing how to bounce the ball up and down, which is called dribbling. It's an important part of the game because it helps you move around the court with the ball. After they had practiced dribbling for a while, the lady and Tina tried passing the ball to each other. This meant they had to throw the ball gently and accurately so the other person could catch it easily. It was fun, and the lady felt like she was getting better at it. Next, they decided to practice shooting the ball into the hoop. Tina showed the lady how to hold the ball with both hands and aim carefully at the hoop before jumping and gently pushing the ball with her hands. Like magic, the ball flew through the air and swished through the hoop, which made the lady very happy and proud.

Women in Finland enjoy a \\"high degree of equality\\" and \\"traditional courtesy\\" among men. In 1906, the women of Finland became the first women in Europe to be granted the right to vote. There are many women in Finland who hold prominent positions in Finnish society, in the academics, in the field of business, and in the government of Finland. An example of powerful women in Finnish politics is Tarja Halonen, who became the first female president of the country (she was Foreign Minister of Finland before becoming president). In the late 18th century and early 19th century private schools for girls were established in Finland, among the more known being those of Christina Krook, Anna Salmberg and Sara Wacklin. These schools were criticized for its shallow education of accomplishments, which resulted in the decision that girls should be included in the school reform of 1843, and the following year, two Swedish-language state schools for girls was founded in Turku and Helsinki, Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Abo and Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors. This led to the establishment of a net of girl schools of a similar kind in Finland. At first the schools were reserved for girls from upper-class families. At this time it was not possible for the girls to pass the baccalaureate and move on to university studies. In 1865 a grammar school made it clear that only girls whose upbringing and manners were impeccable and whose company can't be considered detrimental to others, and who were from \\"respectable\\" families could be in the school. After the first woman in Finland, Maria Tschetschulin, was accepted as a university student by dispensation in 1870, advanced classes and colleges classes were included in many girl schools to prepare students for university (by means of dispensation), and in 1872, the demand that all students must be members of the Swedish language upper classes was dropped. Women were given the right to teach in grammar schools for girls in 1882. When the dispensation for female university students was dropped and women were accepted at the same terms as men in 1915, girls and boys started to receive the same education in the school system, and the girl schools in Finland started to be changed to same sex education, a development which was completed in the 1970s.","output":"This text is about the historical progress and achievements of women in Finland.

A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by Newcastle University re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history. The final event, revolved around the March, the re-enactment was described as a memorable closing to the finale.

The plot borrows heavily from Mister Rogers' neighborhood (if it were run my an oil conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style). Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith this film is set in a post-gas-crisis world in which an all-powerful government doesn't want you to (*ahem*) drive your car and burn gas. Sort of the opposite of today's Enron-and-Bush, oil-grabbing, SUV-pushing government. This juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable. But wait...there's more. Although the film is set in the future, we're not shown any signs of future technology, beyond a return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks... exactly like today. Same clothing, same suburban houses, same green lawns as today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions to alternate energy. The acting is flat and flavorless. Even scenes which could have been gritty or moving, buddy-flick, honor, romance, horror... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase. Continuity is lacking-- the jet flown by Burgess Meredith's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again.

Options: - driveway - parking lot - desert - hop garden - wasteland Reasoning process:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the context of the question The question talks about the value of a garden in a certain situation, in comparison to gasoline. The assumption is that gasoline has high value in all portrayed movies. So, we should find a scenario where having a garden would be more valuable than gasoline. Step 2: Evaluate the options a) Driveway - A driveway is a place for parking vehicles, so having gasoline would seem more valuable here. b) Parking Lot - Just like a driveway, having gasoline would be more valuable in a parking lot where vehicles are stationed. c) Desert - In a desert, water and vegetation are scarce, which makes it difficult to survive. A garden with plants and food sources would be incredibly valuable in such an environment. d) Hop Garden - A hop garden is already a garden dedicated to growing hops, used for brewing beer. So, this is not a contrasting situation with gasoline. e) Wasteland - While a wasteland may seem uninhabitable, it's not providing a clear advantage for having a garden over gasoline, without additional context. Step 3: Determine the most suitable option From the analysis above, the most reasonable answer is option C, desert.

Answer: 760 Justification: Perfect square numbers are integers that are the square of some other integer, usually represented as n^2, where n is an integer. The question asks for the sum of the first sixteen perfect square numbers starting from 12. The only perfect square less than 12 is 1 (1^2=1). Thus, we need to find the sum of the perfect squares from 2^2 to 17^2. Let's calculate the perfect squares and sum them: 2^2 = 4 3^2 = 9 4^2 = 16 5^2 = 25 6^2 = 36 7^2 = 49 8^2 = 64 9^2 = 81 10^2 = 100 11^2 = 121 12^2 = 144 13^2 = 169 14^2 = 196 15^2 = 225 16^2 = 256 17^2 = 289 Adding these 16 perfect square numbers together results in: 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 + 121 + 144 + 169 + 196 + 225 + 256 + 289 = 760 Therefore, the sum of the first sixteen perfect square numbers starting from 12 is 760."},{"instruction":"Given the question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Great app I haven't had any issues\\" The answer is:","output":"5"},{"instruction":"Given the question: Yantis High School - Yantis High School is a 1A high school located in Yantis Texas (USA).

But industry experts say the strategy shift is less an altruistic endeavor than a savvy marketing ploy from a drugstore giant trying to promote itself as a retail health hub in an age of increasingly self-serve healthcare. \\"It's smart business on CVS' part,\\" said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, a state steeped in tobacco history. The drugstore chain — the largest in the country by sales with 123 billion in revenue in 2012 — said Wednesday that it will be tobacco free by Oct. 1. CVS has more than 7,600 stores, making it second in retail locations only to Walgreens. The move comes soon after the 50th anniversary of a landmark report from the surgeon general linking smoking to illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease. Pharmacies have faced years of criticism from health advocates for juxtaposing tobacco items with medical products. Former smoker President Obama applauded CVS, saying the company \\"sets a powerful example\\" and that its decision \\"will have a profoundly positive impact on the health of our country.\\" He added that the strategy shift will aid his administration's efforts to reduce tobacco-related deaths and illnesses while also bringing down healthcare costs. CVS said that it is sacrificing 2 billion in annual revenue in its endeavor, which it said also includes a \\"robust national smoking cessation program\\" to begin this spring. But the Woonsocket, R.I., chain also has much to gain. Amid a shortage of primary care doctors and legislation that expands access to healthcare coverage, CVS and many of its competitors are investing in more in-store urgent care clinics. They're also featuring pharmacists who can offer medical counseling and extending outreach efforts to clinicians and medical centers. More Americans are seeking self-service options at local retailers providing a growing suite of services and products made cheaper and simpler by improving technology, said Columbia Business School professor Rita McGrath. \\"In today's fast-moving, competitive market, retailers are taking their resources from declining categories like cigarettes, where there's a lot of cost associated with securing the products and checking people's ages, and putting them into growth areas that involve health and services,\\" she said. Retail establishments such as CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid operate more than 1,600 health centers, according to an article Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. The piece was written by Dr. Troyen A. Brennan, CVS's chief medical officer, and Dr. Steven A. Schroeder, who runs the Smoking Cessation Leadership Center at UC San Francisco. \\"Making cigarettes available in pharmacies in essence 'renormalizes' the product by sending the subtle message that it cannot be all that unhealthy if it is available for purchase where medicines are sold,\\" they wrote. Investors were uncertain, sending CVS Caremark's stock down 1%, or 67 cents, to 65.44 a share Wednesday. Meanwhile, Walgreen Co. rose 3.4%, or 1.90, to 57.85, and Rite Aid Corp. increased 2%, or 11 cents, to 5.45. But by renouncing cigarettes, CVS could end up engendering loyalty among customers, some experts said. Elena Maa, a Los Feliz mother of four, said she'll patronize the chain even more now that cigarettes are on their way out. \\"Smoking isn't good for us or the kids,\\" said Maa, who was shopping at an East Hollywood CVS with her 3-year-old son, Jake. Maa, 44, said Jake's mild asthma is exacerbated by secondhand smoke. In 2008, San Francisco banned tobacco products in pharmacies, becoming the first U.S. city to do so. Boston and Needham, Mass., followed the next year with similar laws. Less than 5% of cigarette revenue came from pharmacies in 2009, according to the Center for Global Tobacco Control. Walgreens resisted the San Francisco ban and issued an alert arguing that removing cigarettes from drugstores would \\"force smokers to liquor stores, tobacco shops, gas stations and other retailers that don't carry smoking cessation products and don't have pharmacists available for advice on quitting.\\" On Wednesday, Walgreens spokesman Michael Polzin said the company would \\"continue to evaluate the choice of products our customers want, while also helping to educate them and providing smoking cessation products and alternatives that help to reduce the demand for tobacco products.\\" Walgreens said it is working with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare to run a free online program called Sponsorship to Quit, targeting smokers who want to stop. ||||| CVS decision comes amid renewed anti-smoking efforts. Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at American Cancer Society. (Photo: Michael A. Schwarz) Story Highlights CVS' decision to stop selling cigarettes could help smokers quit and avoid relapsing, experts say Forcing smokers to drive even two extra blocks decreases their likelihood of buying tobacco Restricting cigarette purchasers is especially effective for preventing teen smoking, experts say The decision by CVS to stop selling cigarettes could help to cut smoking rates substantially, especially because the move comes at a time of increased pressure on the tobacco industry from a number of fronts, health experts say. \\"It is a big deal — one of those death knell events the tobacco industry has feared for some time,\\" says Thomas Glynn, director of cancer science and trends at the American Cancer Society. Research shows that making cigarettes even slightly less accessible has a measurable effect on smoking, especially for kids, who have fewer ways to get tobacco, says Otis Brawley, the Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \\"It's an act of corporate courage,\\" says Brawley, who says the Cancer Society has pressured pharmacies to ban cigarettes for several years. Studies show that being forced to travel just two extra blocks can deter someone from buying cigarettes, Brawley says. Brawley notes that retailers have known for decades about the importance of positioning products near cash registers, to increase \\"impulse\\" buys. Canada has reduced cigarette sales simply by requiring retailers to store them under the counter, where they're invisible to customers, says Richard Hurt, director of Mayo Clinic's Nicotine Dependence Center. He notes that tobacco companies pay convenience stores a lot of money to position cigarette ads prominently near the register. \\"The tobacco industry has known for decades that if they can place their products in customers' faces, they have more attractiveness,\\" Hurt says. Brawley says he hopes CVS' decision will pressure pharmacies such as Walgreens, which donates a lot of money to the Cancer Society, to also stop selling tobacco. \\"If the cigarettes are right in front of you, if they're convenient, you are more likely to buy them,\\" Brawley says. \\"This is especially true of people who are struggling to quit.\\" The CVS announcement comes amid a number of renewed efforts to combat smoking, including some timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first Surgeon General report on smoking. • The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced a 115 million anti-smoking campaign. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began its third round of anti-smoking ads. Over the past two years, the CDC has spent 162 million on the ads, called \\"Tips from Former Smokers,\\" which have been credited with helping 100,000 Americans quit smoking. This summer, the American Legacy Foundation will launch the latest version of its \\"truth\\" campaign, which has been credited with preventing 450,000 kids from becoming smokers from 2000 to 2004. • A Surgeon General report on smoking last month estimated that tobacco kills 480,000 Americans a year, for a total of 20 million Americans in the past 50 years. In addition, 5.6 million children will die of smoking-related illness unless the country takes immediate action. • Tobacco companies last month reached an agreement with the Justice Department on publishing corrective statements that say the companies lied about the dangers of smoking. The long-awaited advertising campaign was ordered in 2006 by U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler, who found tobacco companies guilty of violating civil racketeering laws and lying to the public about the dangers of smoking and their marketing to children. Because tobacco companies are still appealing part of that ruling, and Kessler has to sign off on the ads' final language, it could take another year or two before the ads actually appear, says Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. • Lawmakers in Kentucky, which has the nation's highest adult smoking rate, at 28%, are considering legislation this week to make workplaces smoke-free. \\"Momentum is strong\\" to pass the bill, which has the support of Kentucky's governor, says Bronson Frick, spokesman for Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights. Twenty-six states and Washington, D.C., now ban smoking in indoor public places. Some question how much impact CVS' decision will have. Jerome Reisman, a senior partner at Reisman Peirez Reisman & Capobianco, a law firm in Garden City, N.Y., predicts the tobacco ban will have a \\"small financial impact on retail sales.\\" Euromonitor International, which tracks industry trends, reports that pharmacies sold fewer than 4% of all cigarettes sold in 2012. David Howard, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, says: \\"We value the long-term relationship we had with CVS and respect their commercial decision. We will work with them as they transition out of the tobacco category in the coming months.\\" (Photo: Jeff Franko) Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a longtime anti-smoking advocate, notes that the tobacco industry still spends 8.5 billion on marketing each year. \\"They remain a very formidable enemy,\\" Frieden says. \\"They are really trying to squeeze every last dollar out of the people they kill.\\" But Frieden also says the \\"days of the tobacco industry are numbered.\\" He notes that a majority of Americans who have ever smoked (about 50 million) have already quit. Most of the country's 42 million current smokers want to quit, he says. \\"There's growing momentum to resume the rapid downward course of smoking and thus the upward course of health,\\" Frieden says. Steven Schroeder, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco, says the country could do far more to combat smoking. Only two states, for example, meet the CDC's goals on spending for anti-smoking efforts, such as educational campaigns. \\"We're a long way from the endgame,\\" Schroeder says. \\"But we are a lot closer.\\" Ending the tobacco epidemic takes \\"political will,\\" says Stanton Glantz, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco. The White House \\"has the power to fix the tobacco problem in a few years, if they would just get off their behinds.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1kVeYRe |||||Summary:","output":"CVS Caremark Corp., a major pharmacy company, announced it will exit the cigarette and tobacco business, drawing praise from medical professionals and lawmakers.

First, let's break down each statement and analyze them individually: 1. \\"A band sets up for a gig under a tent.\\" In this statement, we understand that there is a band getting ready for a performance. The mention of \\"under a tent\\" suggests that the event is likely outdoors or in a location that requires a tent for shelter or accommodation. This statement essentially tells us of the band's preparations and the environment they are expected to perform in. 2. \\"The gig is later today.\\" This statement sets the time frame for the performance—the gig is happening later on during the same day. It confirms that the band has a schedule and a limited amount of time to set up before the performance. Now, let's try to connect these two statements and analyze their relationship: Firstly, the context of a band preparing for a gig is presented. Later on, we understand that the gig is later today, which gives the band members a sense of urgency to set up and ensure everything is ready for their performance. The tent serves as an essential setting providing the band with a comfortable space that protects them from any outdoor elements during their preparations and performance. In conclusion, based on these two statements, one can infer that \\"A band sets up for a gig under a tent\\" if \\"The gig is later today.\\" However, it is important to note that this conclusion is made under the assumption that these two statements are related in context. If, for some reason, they are not associated, then it would not be entirely accurate to draw that conclusion. Nonetheless, the statements' provided context allows us to connect them, indicating that a band is indeed preparing for their gig under a tent with the performance occurring later on the same day."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Ponyo Movie plot: Deep under the surface of the ocean, a sea-wizard named Fujimoto (English: Liam Neeson Japanese: George Tokoro) stands at the bow of his submersible, surrounded by an air bubble and an assortment of sea creatures. They swim circles around him as he pours magic potions into the water. Out of a side porthole, a red goldfish peeks out, making sure not to be seen, before waving goodbye to her smaller siblings and swimming off to join a school of jellyfish. She rests on top of one, domed by another, as they float towards the surface and far from her home.When she wakes up, she finds herself in the harbor of a seaside town, Tomonoura. When a large bottom trawler comes towards her, the goldfish swims away from the jellyfish in an attempt to escape but is quickly pulled into the mess of garbage and debris that the trawler picks up in its net. She becomes trapped within a glass jar but manages to escape the net and make it towards shallow water. Meanwhile, a young boy named Sosuke (English: Frankie Jonas Japanese: Hiroki Doi) runs down the hillside path from his home to the water's edge to play with his toy boat. There, he notices the goldfish stuck in the jar and breaks her out of it, though cutting his thumb in the process. As he holds the seemingly lifeless fish in his hands, she licks his wound clean. Happy that she's alive, the boy takes her back up the hill as a series of strange waves come in and reach for him. The waves return to deeper water where Fujimoto is waiting.

Just before she gets in, she notices Fujimoto crossing her yard with a portable pump on his back. She scolds him for spraying what she thinks is fertilizer, though he attests it's merely pure... The answer is:","output":"Granmamare is the name of Ponyo's mother in the movie \\"Ponyo\\". She is represented as the goddess of the ocean and is married to Fujimoto, the sea-wizard. Voiced by Cate Blanchett in English and Yūki Amami in Japanese, Granmamare is a majestic and wise character who plays a crucial role in the development of the story. She embodies the nurturing aspects of the ocean and the balance of nature, ensuring harmony between the underwater world and the human realm. Throughout the movie, Granmamare exhibits understanding, compassion, and guidance, not only for her daughter Ponyo but also for young Sosuke and humanity as a whole. Ultimately, it's through her wisdom and guidance that the characters in the story learn the importance of balance and harmony in the world. In deciding whether to invest in a film proposal, it's helpful to consider various aspects, such as the characters, plot, and theme. Ponyo's story, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" has a universal appeal, resonating with audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Its engaging storyline and vivid characters, such as Ponyo's mother Granmamare, contribute to the film's overall success. Moreover, the movie's visual style and direction by the acclaimed filmmaker, Hayao Miyazaki, lends it a unique and captivating charm. Known for their fantastical worlds, enchanting characters, and thoughtful storytelling, Miyazaki's movies, including Ponyo, have a strong emotional pull. The environmentally conscious themes and the exploration of the human-nature relationship make the movie not only entertaining but also thought-provoking. When assessing the worthiness of a film proposal, one should also evaluate its potential performance in the market. Since its release, Ponyo has garnered a positive reception from both audiences and critics, contributing to its commercial success. It also stands as an integral part of Studio Ghibli's legacy, a renowned animation studio with an extensive fan base, which increases the film's marketability. In conclusion, when looking to invest in a film proposal, it's important to consider the characters' depth, the plot's appeal, the film's themes, and its market viability. With Ponyo's engaging story, beautifully portrayed characters like Granmamare, visually stunning animation, and the Studio Ghibli connection, it seems that such a proposal has the potential to be a promising investment."},{"instruction":"By.

Murdered: Police have confirmed that 17-year-old Georgia Williams died from 'pressure to the neck' Teenage murder victim Georgia Williams was probably choked to death with a ligature, police have revealed. Earlier today Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee said the 17-year-old died from 'pressure to her neck'. A post-mortem examination found she had suffered 'strangulation' injuries probably caused by having a ligature wrapped around her throat. A West Mercia police spokesman added: 'The guidance being given is that she probably died as a result of strangulation injuries. 'This would be different to being 'strangled' which suggests someone putting their hands around her. 'It is likely a ligature of some sort was used.' Detectives also said Georgia's body had been formally identified, four days after she was found dead in woodland near Wrexham. The results of the post mortem examination were held at Wellington Civic Centre at the same time that her friend Jamie Reynolds appeared at court, charged with murder. The 22-year-old has yet to enter a plea and was remanded in custody until his next hearing on September 6. Wearing a yellow top with a green collar via prison video-link he spoke only to give his name, acknowledge the judge and to confirm that he understood proceedings. Speaking as Georgia's inquest was opened and adjourned, Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee said: 'I can now confirm that the body found in woodland off the Nant-y-Garth pass near Wrexham on Friday afternoon has been formally identified as that of 17-year-old Georgia Williams. 'Although we are not in a position to release any further details for legal reasons, and out of respect for the Williams family at this terribly sad time, I am also able to confirm that Georgia died as a result of pressure being applied to her neck.' Police arrested Reynolds in Glasgow last Wednesday and charged him with murder on Friday following the discovery of a body in woodland near Wrexham. Georgia, whose parents were not in court, went missing from her home in Wellington on Sunday, May 26. Jamie Reynolds, 22, from Wellington, appeared at Stafford Crown Court via video-link today. Detectives today renewed their appeal for members of the public to get in touch if they find the teenager's missing personal items, including her phone, jacket and make-up bag. DS McGee added: 'Although the investigation has progressed quite quickly over the past few days, there is still a lot of work for us to do. 'We are continuing to look for the missing bag, make-up bag, mobile phone and clothing that belonged to Georgia and searches are still ongoing to locate this property. 'The bag is a distinctive spotty leather satchel and her smart phone is a white Samsung Galaxy Y. The make-up bag is pink with a flowered pattern and contained various items of make-up. Steven and Lynette Williams (left) parents of Georgia Williams struggle to contain their emotions at a tribute to their daughter at Wellington AFC football ground last Saturday. A police officer stands watch at the Nant-y-Garth pass near Ruthin, north Wales, where Georgia Williams' body was discovered. 'The missing coat is described as a waist-length black leather-type jacket with a stand-up collar, which she was wearing when she was last seen leaving her family's home in Wellington at 7.30pm on Sunday May 26. 'Locating these items is still extremely important to us, while we also remain keen to hear from anyone who believes they may have seen the Toyota Hiace 300 GS panel van, registration number CX06 ASV, on Monday 27 or Tuesday 28 May.

Arkansas defeated Georgia Tech, 14–7, in front of 45,104 spectators. There were two players named Most Valuable Player: Jim Mooty of Arkansas and Maxie Baughan of Georgia Tech. Possible answers: A). Yes B). It's impossible to say C). No Hypothesis: The 1960 Gator Bowl had a winner.","output":"A). Yes The hypothesis states that \\"The 1960 Gator Bowl had a winner.\\" This is confirmed by the provided paragraph which mentions that \\"Arkansas defeated Georgia Tech, 14–7.\\" Therefore, the team from Arkansas, specifically the Arkansas Razorbacks, were indeed the winners of the 1960 Gator Bowl. In addition, the detail of 'two players named Most Valuable Player' also indicates that the game had been played through to a conclusion that allowed for a judgment on player performance. Most Valuable Player awards are typically given at the end of a game, further implying the hypothesis is correct. The attendance of 45,104 spectators indicates that it was a significant event, as regular-season matches often have less turnout. To summarize, based on the fact that Arkansas defeated Georgia Tech with a score of 14–7, which indicates the completion and decisive result of the game, the hypothesis \\"The 1960 Gator Bowl had a winner\\" is indeed true."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: IRC Morton Hall is an Immigration Removal Centre located in the village of Morton Hall (near Lincoln) in Lincolnshire England.

Sentence A: \\"I saw a car race at the opera hall.\\" Explanation: Opera halls are known for hosting musical performances, operas, and orchestras, and they usually have a stage and seating arrangement to accommodate such events. They are not built or intended for hosting car races, which take place in venues like race tracks or specialized racing circuits. Sentence B: \\"I saw a concert at the opera hall.\\" Explanation: This sentence appears to be in line with common sense because opera halls are indeed designed for hosting musical events, like concerts.

Naming the Parties to the Contract: Think of this like naming your team members on our treasure hunt. These team members are the people who are selling their house (we call them 'the seller') and the people who want to buy it (we call them 'the buyer'). By writing their names on the contract, we know who is involved in this adventure. 2. Titling the Contract: A title is like naming your adventure. It has to say what the contract is about. When we are buying or selling a house, the contract might have a title like \\"Real Estate Purchase Contract\\", kind of like how your adventure might be called \\"The Hunt for the Golden House\\". 3. Dating the Contract: This is when we mark when our adventure starts. When we put the date on the contract, we know exactly when the buyer and seller agreed to go on this house buying or selling adventure together. 4. Describing the Real Estate: This is where we make the blueprint for our treasure. We draw and describe the house that's being bought or sold. We write down things like how big it is, where it is and what special things it has, like a wooden deck or a swimming pool. 5. Detailing any Personal Property Included in the Sale: Sometimes, a treasure hunt can include bonus treasures. In our adventure, these could be things like the furniture or appliances that come with the house. So, we also write these down on our contract map. 6. Including a Signature Block: Last but not least, we need a special spot for the team members on our treasure hunt to sign. When the buyer and the seller sign this block, it's like they're saying, \\"Yes, we agree with this adventure map, and we're ready to start!\\" Just like how a treasure map helps us find our golden treasure, a contract helps us when we're buying or selling a house.

The Constitution of the United States establishes the structure of the federal government and defines the powers and responsibilities of each branch. This constitutional framework creates a system of checks and balances that ensure no single entity has absolute authority. The legislative process for deciding which laws are necessary and proper primarily involves three branches of the U.S. federal government: the Legislative (Congress), the Executive (the President), and the Judiciary (the Supreme Court and other federal courts). Additionally, state and local governments also play a significant role in making and enforcing laws within their jurisdictions. 1. Legislative Branch (U.S. Congress): The U.S. Congress, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives, is responsible for making federal laws. Members of Congress, who are elected officials representing their respective states and districts, propose new legislation through bills that they introduce, discuss, and debate. Both the Senate and the House must pass the bill for it to become law. 2. Executive Branch (The President): Once both the Senate and the House of Representatives pass the bill, it goes to the President. The President then has the option to either sign the bill into law or veto it. If the President veto it, the bill then goes back to Congress. Congress can override a Presidential veto by obtaining a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. 3. Judiciary Branch (Supreme Court and other federal courts): The federal judiciary plays a vital role in deciding the constitutionality of laws passed by the Congress and signed by the President. If a dispute arises related to a particular law, the case may eventually reach the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court determines if the law is consistent with the U.S. Constitution, and if it deems the law unconstitutional, the law becomes null and void. In addition to the federal government, each state has its legislative, executive, and judicial branches, which also have the authority to decide laws within their jurisdictions. State legislatures pass laws, Governors or other state executives can sign or veto these laws, and state courts can interpret and determine the legality of these laws. Moreover, local governments, such as city councils and county boards, also have the power to make and enforce laws within their jurisdictions. In conclusion, the decision on which laws are necessary and proper in the U.S. system of government involves collaborative efforts from multiple branches and levels of government. These processes ensure that laws are established through democratic means, represent the interests of the people, and uphold the principles enshrined in the U.S. Constitution."},{"instruction":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Excellent app\\"","output":"I would rate this review a 5, as it expresses a highly favorable opinion with the word \\"excellent\\"."},{"instruction":"Question: How much money has been invested in Detroit in 2013-2014?

This is factual and can be easily understood, so this sentence makes sense. - Sentence B: \\"Shoes shine on the earth\\" This sentence implies that shoes, which are objects typically worn on one's feet, are emitting or reflecting light upon the earth. Unlike Sentence A, Sentence B doesn't make logical sense as shoes themselves do not have the ability to emit light like the sun. While some shoes may have reflective or shiny surfaces that can reflect light, the phrasing of the sentence makes it nonsensical since it treats shoes as if they act like a light source, similar to the sun.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Saloninus, born around 242 AD, was the son of Roman Emperor Gallienus and his wife, Cornelia Salonina. He belonged to the Licinius Dynasty and was titled 'Caesar of the Roman Empire.' An image of him can be seen on an Antoninianus of Saloninus. Saloninus' reign began in 258 AD when his father designated him as a Caesar, a title typically given to heirs apparent or junior emperors. He served under Gallienus, and his reign continued until (perhaps) July 260. During his brief time as a full emperor, Saloninus held the title of Caesar and succeeded his father, Gallienus. Despite having a short reign, the young emperor Saloninus had to face many challenges. His predecessor, Gallienus, is said to have ruled during a particularly tumultuous period in Roman history when the empire was under constant threat from external invasions and internal power struggles. Saloninus' mother, Cornelia Salonina, played a significant role in his life, providing support and counsel. However, it was not enough for Saloninus to hold on to power, and his reign took a tragic turn in 260 when he was reportedly killed in Colonia Agrippina, the place of his death. Following his demise, Gallienus became his successor and continued to rule the empire."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - The Sega CD, released as the in most regions outside North America, is a CD-ROM accessory for the Sega Genesis video game console designed and produced by Sega as part of the fourth generation of video game consoles.

Nintendo was able to capitalize on its previous success in the third generation and managed to win the largest worldwide market share in the fourth generation as well. Sega was extremely successful in this generation and began a new franchise, Sonic the Hedgehog, to compete with Nintendo's Mario series of games. Several other companies released consoles in this generation, but none of them were widely successful. Nevertheless, several other companies started to take notice of the maturing video game industry and began making plans to release consoles of their own in the future. This generation ended with the discontinuation of the Neo Geo in 2004. - The Stanford Cardinal football program represents Stanford University in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level and is a member of the Pac-12 Conference's North Division.

A. hungry B. gas C. obesity D. gain weight E. feeling full The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer is C. obesity The person described in the question was eating too much without exercising enough. As a result, they would have consumed more calories than their body could burn, leading to an unhealthy weight gain over time. Obesity is a medical condition where a person has an excessive amount of body fat, which can lead to various health problems such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and certain types of cancer. The other options do not accurately describe the long-term consequences of the person's overeating and lack of exercise. A. Hungry: While it may be surprising, a person who consistently overeats may still experience hunger, as hunger is not solely determined by the amount of food consumed. It is also influenced by hormonal and emotional factors. B. Gas: Overeating and lack of exercise can sometimes lead to digestive problems, including gas. However, gas is a temporary problem and not a long-term consequence of an imbalanced intake of calories and exercise. D. Gain weight: Gaining weight could be a part of obesity, but merely gaining weight does not give the full picture of the adverse health effects that can result from chronic overeating and lack of exercise. Obesity refers to an excessive accumulation of body fat, specifically. E. Feeling full: While overeating can leave a person feeling full, it does not describe the long-term effects of overeating without exercising. A person may feel full after a large meal, but eventually, the excessive calories consumed will lead to obesity. In conclusion, the best answer to the question is obesity (C), as it best describes the long-term consequences of eating too much and not exercising enough. Obesity can lead to severe health problems and should be addressed by adopting a balanced diet and incorporating regular exercise into daily routines."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

To elaborate, the process described is the formation of fossils through fossilization, specifically permineralization. This process involves the gradual replacement of the organic material of the remains of plants and animals with surrounding minerals. Permineralization results in the creation of a solid, durable object in the shape of the original organism or its parts, preserving a detailed record of the ancient life forms, which we call fossils. Here is the detailed and complete process: 1. Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud: When animals and plants die, they may fall into or be carried into areas with soft soil or mud. These environments help protect the dead organisms from predators, scavengers, and environmental factors such as weather and erosion, making it more likely that their remains will be preserved long enough for fossilization to occur. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains: Over time, layers of sediment, like silt, sand, or clay, accumulate over the remains of dead organisms. This accumulation can happen through natural processes like flooding, landslides, volcanic eruptions, or the natural settling of sediment particles in a water body. As more sediment piles up on top of the remains, the added weight and pressure compact the layers beneath, forming sedimentary rock. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts: As the buried organism starts to decompose, it leaves behind only trace amounts of its original organic material. Decomposition is facilitated by microorganisms and chemical reactions that break down the organic components. Even though most of the organic material decomposes, the fossilization process can still occur because the overall structure and shape of the organism has been preserved by the layers of sediment that enveloped it. 4. The remaining parts over the years are replaced with minerals: Over thousands or even millions of years, mineral-laden groundwater percolates through the pores and spaces within the buried remains. As the water evaporates or changes in chemistry, minerals precipitate and gradually replace the remaining organic material, essentially turning it into stone. This process, known as permineralization, effectively fills the structural voids left by the decaying organic material with minerals like silica, calcite, or pyrite, making the final fossil more resistant to erosion and other potential destructive processes. 5. Formation and discovery of fossils: After the permineralization process is completed and the remaining parts have been replaced with minerals, the end result is a fossil. These fossils can remain buried deep within the layers of sedimentary rock for millions of years until geological processes, such as erosion or excavation, expose them. Once exposed, paleontologists and other researchers can discover and study these fossils to learn more about the ancient organisms, their biology, behavior, and their environment. In conclusion, the final step of the described process is the formation and eventual discovery of fossils. Fossils provide invaluable insights into the history of life on Earth, allowing scientists to study and understand the biological processes, evolutionary trends, and environmental changes that have occurred over millions of years."},{"instruction":"But there was one explicit clause Translate to Czech","output":"Ale byla tam jedna konkrétní ustanovení Vysvětlení: Tento věta znamená, že v dohodě nebo pravidlech bylo jedno konkrétní ustanovení nebo pravidlo, které něco vysvětluje nebo stanovuje. Když to říkáme česky, řekneme \\"Ale byla tam jedna konkrétní ustanovení\\"."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. and the situation: Jonathan is attending a football game for his favorite team. Before the game, there will be a fireworks display and a fly over by some jet fighter planes. Jonathan has been looking forward to the fireworks for weeks because he has heard they are really great. The fireworks begin and their sound waves are of a high intensity. After the fireworks, the jets fly over and the sound waves for that has an even higher intensity than the fireworks did. Answer the following question: Which sound less likely damaged Jonathan's ears? Answer:","output":"From the information provided in the background, we can understand that the intensity of sound is directly proportional to the decibel level. In other words, higher decibel levels translate to more intense, louder sounds. Consequently, such high-intensity sounds pose a risk for potential damage to the ears and resultant hearing loss. In the situation presented, Jonathan is exposed to two primary sources of sound - the fireworks display and a flyover by jet fighter planes. The intensity of these sound sources is not given directly in numerical terms but we are informed that the sound intensity of the jets flyover was higher than that of the fireworks. Since the risk of ear damage is tied directly to the intensity of the sound, the fireworks, with a lower intensity than the jets, would be less likely to cause damage to Jonathan's ears. However, it is important to note that the term 'less likely' does not imply 'no risk'. Even if the decibel level of the fireworks is lower than that of the jet flyover, if it was still a high-decibel sound, Jonathan's hearing could be potentially affected. This is due to the logarithmic nature of decibel scale where a 10-decibel increase translates to 10 times increase in loudness. Therefore, it would be appropriate for Jonathan to use ear protection in both situations to fully avoid the risk of any hearing damage due to exposure to these high-intensity sounds. In conclusion, while in comparison, the fireworks at the football game posed less of a risk to Jonathan's ears than the jet flyover, both high-intensity sounds carry with them the potential for hearing damage."},{"instruction":"Is the test taker report for GMAT accessible immediately after the test ? It’s not the official score report that GMAC sends after 15-20 days. India available in types of chees? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions you've presented are distinct from one another, addressing two separate topics. Let me provide detailed and long answers for both of them: 1. Is the test taker report for GMAT accessible immediately after the test? It’s not the official score report that GMAC sends after 15-20 days. The GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) is a computer adaptive test taken by prospective MBA and business school candidates to gauge their analytical, writing, and mathematical skills. Administered by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT score plays a significant role in business school admissions. On finishing the GMAT, candidates can view their unofficial scores instantly. The moment the test ends, an on-screen message explains the reporting procedure and offers a choice to accept or cancel the scores. If the candidate accepts the scores, the unofficial test taker report, which includes the Verbal, Quantitative, and Integrated Reasoning scores, is readily available. The total score, without the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) score, appears. However, this is only an informal report and isn't the complete official score report. The official score report, which incorporates the AWA score, is available within the mentioned 15-20 days following the exam. GMAC sends this report to the candidate's chosen business schools. Moreover, the applicant receives an email containing instructions to access the online official scores. 2. India available in types of chees? This question seems to be about the types of cheese available in India. India has a diverse food culture with numerous regional cuisines and a variety of dairy dishes. Although the popularity of cheese is not as widespread as in Western countries, India has its indigenous and diverse variations of cheese. Here are some popular Indian cheeses: a. Paneer: Paneer, also called Indian cottage cheese, is an unaged, non-melting cheese made from curdled milk and a food acid like lemon juice or vinegar. Widely consumed in Indian dishes, it's used in savory preparations like paneer tikka, shahi paneer, and paneer butter masala, and in desserts like rasgulla and rasmalai. b. Chhena: Chhena (or chhana) is similar to paneer but has a softer, crumbly texture. It's an essential component of most Bengali sweets like sandesh, chum chum, and kheer kadam. c. Kalari: Also called maish krej, the traditional Kalari cheese hails from the Kashmir region. The milk used originates from either the cow or the buffalo. Often compared to mozzarella, it is served fried, accompanied by local spices and vegetables. d. Dalle: Dalle, found predominantly in the Sikkim region, is a fermented and dried cheese made from cow's milk. Often used as a condiment or flavor enhancer, it lends itself to soups, stews, or curries. e. Bandel: Originating from Bengal, Bandel cheese is a combination of Portuguese and Bengali cheese-making practices. It's available in two variants, plain and smoked, and is traditionally wrapped in palm leaves. Additionally, due to globalization and changing dietary preferences, several international cheeses like cheddar, mozzarella, brie, camembert, and feta can be found at gourmet food stores, larger supermarkets, and online stores in India."},{"instruction":"Sydney found Remy's phone so she left it at her desk near the disposal.

Answer: The second E85 flexifuel model introduced by Saab in the Swedish market. Question: what part of the corn is used in ethanol production","output":"While I understand that you are looking for a simple yes or no answer, the question provided requires a more detailed response to accurately address the topic of ethanol fuel and its production from corn. To answer the question \\"What part of the corn is used to produce ethanol?\\": The main component of corn that is used in the production of ethanol is the corn kernel, specifically the starch within the kernel. Ethanol is produced through a process that involves the fermentation of sugars, and the starch within the corn kernel is an ideal source of these fermentable sugars. The process can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Harvesting: Corn is harvested and transported to an ethanol production facility. 2. Milling: In the facility, the corn kernels are ground into a fine powder called cornmeal. This process makes it easier to extract the valuable starches within the kernel. 3. Liquefaction: The cornmeal is mixed with water and enzymes, creating a mash. The enzymes help to break down the starches into simpler sugars, such as glucose and maltose. 4. Fermentation: Yeast is introduced to the mash, which then converts the sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process typically takes place in large fermentation tanks. 5. Distillation: The fermented mash is heated, and the ethanol is separated from the remaining solid and liquid components. The ethanol vapor is then condensed back into a liquid form. 6. Dehydration: The distilled ethanol is then passed through a dehydration process to remove any remaining water, resulting in anhydrous ethanol – the final product. 7. Co-products: The leftover solid components, known as distillers grains, are often used as livestock feed, while the liquid components can be used in various other applications such as fertilizers. It is also worth mentioning the Saab E85 flexifuel models, since you brought them up in your initial statement. These vehicles are designed to run on a blend of gasoline and ethanol called E85, which contains up to 85% ethanol. The introduction of such models by Saab demonstrates the increasing popularity and growing acceptance of ethanol as an alternative, sustainable fuel source. This expanding market is one of the reasons why understanding the process of ethanol production from corn is essential. In conclusion, the production of ethanol fuel primarily utilizes the starch found in corn kernels. The process involves several steps including milling, liquefaction, fermentation, distillation, and dehydration, resulting in a sustainable and renewable fuel source that can be used in vehicles like the Saab E85 flexifuel models."},{"instruction":"The Creed family moves into a new home , close to a road where truckers often drive unsafely .

Question: suppose the wound is not properly cared for happens, how will it affect LESS SEVERE disease occurring. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"To answer the question about how an improperly cared for wound would affect a less severe disease occurring, we must break down and analyze the process step by step. 1. Skin is cut or damaged: When the skin is damaged, it loses its protective barrier, making it vulnerable to bacterial infiltration. In this case, improper wound care increases the chances of bacteria being introduced to the wound. 2. Bacteria enters through the wound: With an improperly cared for wound, the likelihood of bacteria entering increases. It will depend on the environment and other factors to determine the severity of the bacteria that enters. 3. The bacteria reproduces and spreads: If the wound is not properly cleaned, dressed, and protected, bacteria have a better chance to reproduce and spread. This increases the likelihood of an infection developing and potentially worsening. 4. Causes symptoms: The severity of symptoms will depend on the type and amount of bacteria that have entered, as well as the body's immune response. The existence of symptoms may prompt a person to seek medical attention, which could mitigate the severity of the disease. 5. The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease: An improperly cared for wound has a higher risk of leading to disease, as the body may struggle to effectively fight off the infection. In some cases, this could lead to a more severe disease occurring. But, if the infection is less severe or the immune system can manage to combat it, the disease might be less severe than if proper care was taken. Considering this process, an improperly cared-for wound would have more effect on a less severe disease occurring. The increased chance of bacterial infection and less effective immune response due to improper care could lead to a more serious disease than if the wound had been properly managed."},{"instruction":"Student: Can we conclude from \\"A young boy drives a power wheels motorcycle with an american flag attached to the back.\\" that \\"A young boy rides a toy motorcycle.\\"?

What is the answer they should choose between \\"kitchen floor\\" and \\"brick patio\\"? Logic test: Nancy noticed her broom was not as effective on the textured brick patio as it was on her vinyl kitchen floor, as it wouldn't sweep smoothly. This is because (A) the patio has more friction or (B) the kitchen floor has more friction.","output":"Based on the given logic test, the students should choose option (A) the patio has more friction as the correct answer. Here's an explanation for this conclusion: The question describes a comparison of two different surfaces: the textured brick patio and the vinyl kitchen floor. The primary aspect mentioned is the effectiveness of a broom when used on these surfaces. It is stated that the broom doesn't sweep as smoothly on the brick patio compared to the kitchen floor. Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. In this case, the two surfaces in question are the broom bristles and the two different types of flooring. When an object (like a broom) moves across a textured surface (like the brick patio), the irregularities on the brick surface create more points of contact, providing more resistance or opposition to the motion of the broom. This increased resistance results in a higher frictional force. On the other hand, when an object moves across a smoother surface (like the vinyl kitchen floor), there are fewer points of contact between the surface and the object. This means that less resistance or opposition is offered to the motion of the broom, resulting in a lower frictional force. Since Nancy noticed her broom was not as effective on the textured brick patio as it was on her vinyl kitchen floor, it can be inferred that she experienced more friction on the patio than on the kitchen floor. This is due to the textured surface of the brick patio creating more contact points and thus requiring more effort to move the broom, whereas the smoother surface of the kitchen floor offers less resistance, allowing the broom to sweep more smoothly. Therefore, the correct choice based on the logic test is option (A) the patio has more friction."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again. This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service. Athanasius fled to Upper Egypt, where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. During this period, Athanasius completed his work Four Orations against the Arians and defended his own recent conduct in the Apology to Constantius and Apology for His Flight. Constantius's persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop George of Laodicea, prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional History of the Arians, in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the Antichrist.\\"?

Gently pat your face dry with a towel. Pour a small amount of astringent onto the cotton ball, enough to make the top of the ball moist but not soaked through. You may rub it in gently, but do not scrub. If you have combination skin, try dabbing the astringent only in your oily areas (often the forehead, nose, and chin). Skip over any dry areas. Some astringents also come in spray bottles that you can lightly mist over your face without using a cotton ball. Wait for your astringent to absorb slightly. Then, apply a moisturizer that contains an SPF 30 or higher sunscreen. Choose a light moisturizer or one formulated for oily skin. You may think adding moisturizer to oily skin will only make things worse, but drying out your skin too much can cause even more oil production. It’s best to keep your skin balanced with a light moisturizer. Sunscreen is helpful since your skin is more likely to be sensitive to light after using astringent. Apply your astringent once per day, after you wash your face in the morning. Skip the astringent after cleansing your skin in the evening. If desired, you may use toner in the evening in place of astringent. Even the mildest of astringents can burn if you put them on an open cut or scratch on your face. It’s best to avoid these areas and wait to apply astringent until the skin is healthy again. If you feel a burning sensation or your face becomes red after applying astringent, stop using it. Calm your skin by applying moisturizer. Try a more soothing astringent, or switch to using toner instead.

Erin sat very straight, so Jessica tried to imitate him, because","output":"Erin sat very straight, so Jessica tried to imitate him, because she admired his posture and believed that adopting a similar stance could convey confidence, grace, and composure. As Jessica mimicked Erin's upright position, she contemplated how this change in posture might influence her overall demeanor and impact the way others perceived her. In a society where impressions are formed almost immediately, maintaining a good posture is crucial not only for physical health, but also for sending nonverbal cues of self-assurance, engagement, and resilience. Indeed, one's body language speaks volumes and often communicates more than the words themselves. Recognizing Erin's impeccable posture as a powerful aspect of his persona, Jessica sought to incorporate this attribute into her own bearing in hopes of boosting her self-esteem and enhancing her interpersonal relationships. As she continued to observe Erin, Jessica took note of the nuances in his posture, such as the way he aligned his shoulders, tucked in his chin, and kept his back straight without straining. Jessica also noticed how Erin's posture contributed to his natural charisma, and she began to draw connections between his bearing and his ability to engage others in conversations or command their attention. Moreover, Jessica realized that posture undeniably impacts one's physical health. Proper alignment can reduce strain on muscles, prevent pain in the neck and back, and even improve respiratory function. Consequently, by imitating Erin's sitting posture, she understood that she was also making a conscious effort to enhance her overall well-being. Determined to benefit from these advantages, Jessica practiced sitting up straight whenever she caught herself slouching or hunching over her desk. Over time, she developed a heightened awareness of her body, enabling her to identify and correct her posture in various positions and environments. Consequently, Jessica's confidence grew as she became more comfortable in her skin and began to feel a greater sense of control over her body and, by extension, her interactions with others.

The Argentine police A:","output":"Title: \\"Sombra de los Terceros\\" The narrative begins in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1971. The Argentine police force is on high alert because of mysterious activities surrounding the German immigrant population within the city. Whispered rumors of anomalous activities and disappearances in the German community catch the attention of accomplished and highly-regarded Detective Gabriela Diaz. A group of East Germans recently immigrated to Argentina, and since their arrival, there have been strange occurrences like equipment thefts from technology firms and even mysterious disappearances of renowned scientists. These incidents alarm Diaz and compel her to investigate. The Argentine police force, aware of Germany's infamous past during World War II, can't overlook the element of potential threats that might destabilise not just Argentina, but potentially pose a risk to global security. Simultaneously, a charismatic but enigmatic German immigrant, Walter Schmidt, is introduced. He operates a small-time brewery in Buenos Aires but takes a keen interest in the dramatically thriving tech landscape of the city. As Diaz progressively ventures deeper into the suspicious activities, her path intersects with Schmidt. Throughout her investigation, Diaz discovers evidence of an elaborate plot involving the stolen technology. The conspiracy appears to reach further than she initially supposed, implying that a covert and dangerous organization within the German immigrant community, led by Schmidt, is planning something catastrophic. During her search for the truth, Diaz gradually unravels Schmidt's past. He was a brilliant scientist back in East Germany who was forcibly recruited into clandestine operations during the Cold War. When he defected to Argentina, he didn't come alone but with a cunning plan to create a powerful weapon that has the potential to create global chaos. In the heart-stopping climax, Diaz, together with her loyal team, sets up an operation to dismantle Schmidt's plans. They uncover a maze-like laboratory under the brewery filled with advanced high-tech equipment. Together with Argentina's finest, Diaz faces off against Schmidt and his loyal followers. The movie ends with a highly-charged showdown between Diaz and Schmidt, followed by a race against time to dismantle the threatening weapon. But even as the Argentine police emerge victorious, Diaz can't shake off the feeling that Schmidt was just the beginning of a much larger operation. \\"Sombra de los Terceros\\" would be a thrilling combination of crime, action, and suspense, dwelling on themes of immigration, nationalism, and the potentially destructive aspects of technological advancement.

Is it possible to have a 90%+ accuracy in predicting a football (soccer) match result based on previous results? What are the not so obvious (in your opinion) issues that could reduce accuracy and what data should I factor in? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The technique to predict a football match result usually involves analyzing a wide range of data and factors to create a statistical model that estimates the likelihood of each possible outcome. While it is difficult to achieve 90%+ accuracy consistently, some highly sophisticated predictive models can indeed achieve impressive success rates. Here is a detailed overview of the process and some of the not-so-obvious issues that could reduce accuracy: 1. Data collection: The first step in predicting a football match result is gathering historical data on the teams involved. This often includes data on the teams' past matches (both against each other and other opponents), player performance, team performance, goal counts, win-loss ratios, as well as other contextual factors such as team managers, tactics, and playing styles. 2. Feature engineering: The next step is to determine which data points or \\"features\\" should be included in the predictive model. Incorporating too many features can lead to overfitting, where the model overfits on historical data and fails to generalize well on unseen data. Conversely, too few features can lead to underfitting, where the model cannot fully capture the complexity of the data. The goal is to find a balance between the two. 3. Model selection: There are various machine learning and statistical models suited for predicting match results, such as logistic regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. Each of these models has its own assumptions and strengths, and selecting the appropriate model requires consideration of the problem's specific characteristics. 4. Model training: After selecting the model, it needs to be trained on the collected data to learn the relationships between the inputs (features) and the outputs (match results). This usually involves dividing the data into a \\"training set\\" used to teach the model and a \\"test set\\" used to evaluate its performance. 5. Model evaluation: Once the model has been trained, it should be evaluated based on well-defined metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. These metrics help assess the model's performance and overall reliability. 6. Model tuning: The model's hyperparameters may need to be adjusted to improve its performance. This may involve exploring various combinations of hyperparameters to find the optimal balance between complexity and generalizability. 7. Finally, once a satisfactory model has been developed, it can be used to predict the outcomes of future matches. There are several not-so-obvious issues that could reduce the accuracy of the model: 1. Missing or incorrect data: The accuracy of a model is highly dependent on the quality of the data used for training. If the data is incomplete or inaccurate, the model's predictions may be flawed. 2. Non-stationarity: Football matches are dynamic and continuously evolving. Players, tactics, and other factors change over time, leading to \\"non-stationarity\\" in football data. This means that past relationships in the data may not hold true in the future, reducing the model's accuracy. 3. Randomness: Football is an unpredictable sport, with many matches decided by chance events and fine margins. As a result, it is challenging to create a model that can account for every potential outcome with high accuracy. 4. Omitted variable bias: Certain factors that can influence the result of a football match may be overlooked or unavailable, leading to biased predictions. As for the data you should factor in, some important components include: 1. Team form and recent performance. 2. Goals scored, goals conceded, and goal differences. 3. Home and away records. 4. Head-to-head history between the teams. 5. Strength of schedule, considering the quality of opponents faced. 6. Line-ups, including injuries and suspensions. 7. Team tactics, styles of play, and manager strategies. 8. Weather conditions, field quality, and other external factors. Regarding the two questions, both relate to predicting football match results, with the first one focusing on the technique and the second one on the percentage of accuracy. The second question sheds light on some issues that may impact accuracy and inquires about specific data that should be factored in. On the whole, they share a common theme but have different focuses."},{"instruction":"Bill and Chris are passionate entomologists. Bill knows everything there is to know about most ants except the Leafcutter ants. Chris studied Leafcutter ants extensively and exclusively for years now. They are good friends and exchange ideas often over a pint of beer. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend studied more about fungus eating ants? Hint: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.","output":"Chris studied more about fungus eating ants, since he extensively and exclusively studied Leafcutter ants which feed on fungus within their colonies."},{"instruction":"Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.

What is the solution?","output":"We will solve this linear equation step by step in order to find the value of n. Step 1: Combine the terms with n. The equation is: 0 = 795*n + 219*n + 30420 We can rewrite it as: 0 = (795+219)*n + 30420 Step 2: Calculate the sum of the coefficients of n. 795 + 219 = 1014 Now the equation becomes: 0 = 1014*n + 30420 Step 3: Isolate the term with n. We want to get n by itself, so we'll subtract 30420 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 30420 = 1014*n + 30420 - 30420 Which simplifies to: -30420 = 1014*n Step 4: Solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n (1014). -30420 / 1014 = 1014*n / 1014 This simplifies to: n = -30 So the solution for the equation is n = -30."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness.

I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed.

Question 2: Can someone help me find out my sexual orientation? OPTIONS: (i). no (ii). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answer to Question 1: Finding out one's sexual orientation is a personal and, at times, complex journey. Sexual orientation refers to enduring patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes. It is important to understand that sexual orientation is not the same as sexual behavior or sexual identity, and it can be fluid, evolving over one's lifetime. Here are some steps to help you find out your sexual orientation: 1. Reflect on your attractions: Consider whom you are emotionally, romantically, and sexually drawn to. Attractions can be different for everyone and may not align with your sexual behavior. It is essential to be honest with yourself when evaluating your intimacy preferences and desires. 2. Explore your feelings: Understanding your emotional response to different situations or individuals can help you identify your sexual orientation. For example, think about how you feel toward people of the same sex, opposite sex, or both when you watch movies, read about or see romantic stories, or witness close relationships. 3. Analyze your past and present relationships: Consider the people you've been attracted to or had crushes on in the past. Assess the nature of those feelings, and try to determine if there is a pattern regarding the gender of the individuals who sparked your interest. 4. Engage with different communities: Getting involved with various communities and organizations, such as LGBTQIA+ groups and resources, can help expose you to different perspectives and experiences, which may allow you to relate to or recognize your situation. 5. Seek professional counseling or therapy: If you're struggling with understanding or accepting your sexual orientation, consider seeking help from a mental health professional who is experienced in dealing with sexuality-related issues. 6. Be patient with yourself: It's important to remember that discovering one's sexual orientation is an individual process that takes time. Some people may know early in life, while others might not discover it until much later. Give yourself time and space to understand your feelings and attractions naturally. Answer to Question 2: Yes, someone can help you find out your sexual orientation, although it is ultimately a personal journey. Friends, family members, or mental health professionals can offer support, guidance, and understanding during this process. Here are some ways others can offer assistance: 1. Provide a safe and supportive environment for conversations about your feelings and attractions, where you can express your thoughts openly and without judgment. 2. Encourage honest self-reflection, helping you think about your emotions, attractions, and past relationships. 3. Offer resources, such as educational information on different sexual orientations, LGBTQIA+ communities, and support organizations, that help you navigate and understand the process better. 4. Recommend professional counseling or therapy if needed, as mental health professionals with experience in sexuality-related issues can offer valuable insight and guidance. 5. Be patient and empathetic, acknowledging that accepting and understanding one's sexual orientation is a unique journey and can take time. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. The first question (\\"How can I find out my sexual orientation?\\") focuses on providing guidance for an individual attempting to determine their sexual orientation. The second question (\\"Can someone help me find out my sexual orientation?\\") centers on whether or not someone can assist a person in that process, specifying the ways others can offer support and help."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Matsudaira Yasuhide - Matsudaira Yasuhide (松平 康英) (July 16 1830 – July 5 1904) was a Japanese daimyo of the late Edo period who ruled the Tanakura and then Kawagoe Domains.

Complete the next sentence: How to be a good landlord Explain the lease to new tenants. Whenever you have a new tenant, make it a point to sit down with them and go through the lease in detail. Do your part to make sure they understand everything in it before they sign on the dotted line.","output":"Being a good landlord involves more than just explaining the lease to new tenants. It also means maintaining a professional relationship with them, taking care of the property, and nurturing a sense of community among your tenants. Below are some additional pointers on how to be a good landlord: 1. Be responsive and approachable: Make sure your tenants feel comfortable reaching out to you with questions or concerns. Respond promptly to any inquiries, be it via phone, email, or in-person visits. This helps to establish trust – your tenants will appreciate knowing they can rely on you when needed. 2. Set clear expectations: Clearly state your expectations regarding rent payments, maintenance, and adhering to the terms of the lease. Ensure that everyone understands their responsibilities to prevent misunderstandings down the line. It's essential to be consistent in enforcing the rules, but also be willing to offer leniency under exceptional circumstances. 3. Carry out regular maintenance and repairs: Proactively maintain your rental property by performing routine checks and addressing any issues promptly. This could involve tasks like painting, fixing broken appliances, and landscaping. By doing so, you not only preserve the value of your investment but also demonstrate your commitment to providing your tenants with a comfortable living environment. 4. Respect your tenants' privacy: As a landlord, it's crucial to respect the privacy of your tenants. Avoid making unannounced visits, and always provide a reasonable notice before entering their living space, unless there is an emergency. By doing this, you can maintain a professional relationship and show respect for their boundaries. 5. Screen your tenants: Conduct a thorough background check and gather references from potential tenants. This helps you to identify responsible individuals who are likely to pay rent on time, take good care of the property, and comply with all terms of the lease. This can save you from potential headaches and the hassle of dealing with problematic tenants. 6. Promote a sense of community: Foster a sense of unity and belonging among tenants by hosting community events like BBQs, holiday parties, or yard sales. This can create a positive atmosphere and encourage tenants to communicate with each other and address issues as a group. Happy tenants are more likely to stay long-term and recommend your rentals to others. 7. Stay up-to-date on local laws and regulations: Familiarize yourself with local rental laws and property management regulations to ensure you are in compliance. Failure to do so may result in penalties and legal disputes that could've been easily avoided. 8. Be open to negotiation: While it's essential to stay firm on certain rules and regulations, being flexible and open to negotiation on smaller matters can contribute to a positive landlord-tenant relationship. For example, allowing a tenant to have a pet or to repaint a room might just strengthen your relationship and increase the chances of retaining reliable tenants. 9. Keep accurate records: Document all transactions and communications with your tenants, such as rental payments, maintenance requests, and notices. This will help in case of disputes or legal issues and serve as a reminder of agreed-upon terms. Good record-keeping is also essential for tax purposes. 10. Act fairly and be empathetic: Treat all your tenants equally, regardless of their race, religion, gender, or any other factors. Strive to understand their unique situations and be open to finding resolutions that are fair and reasonable. By being a fair and compassionate landlord, you encourage an environment of respect and understanding that can lead to long-lasting and successful tenancies."},{"instruction":"A surrogate mother gave birth to twin girls for Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, a publicist for the couple said.

The answer is:","output":"The missing first step in the process of respiration is the initiation of the inhalation process, known as inspiration, which occurs due to a signal sent from the brain to stimulate the respiratory muscles. To provide a more detailed explanation, when the body needs to intake more oxygen, it begins with the medulla oblongata and pons (which are parts of the brainstem) that control involuntary bodily functions. These brain areas continuously monitor the blood's carbon dioxide and oxygen levels via chemoreceptors (sensors) located in the carotid and aortic bodies. When the carbon dioxide levels rise in the blood, indicating that the body requires more oxygen, a signal is sent from the brain to the respiratory muscles. This signal travels down the spinal cord and reaches the diaphragm, a large, dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. Along with the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles (muscles that are situated between the ribs) also receive this signal. As a result of this signal, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, allowing the chest cavity to expand both downwards and outwards. This expansion creates a decrease in the air pressure within the thoracic cavity compared to the atmospheric pressure outside the body. Consequently, air is drawn into the lungs through the mouth and nose, commencing the process of inspiration. To summarize, the missing first step in the process is the brain sending a signal to the respiratory muscles, which then contract to initiate the process of inhalation. Thus, the entire process can be outlined as follows: 1. The brain monitors blood's carbon dioxide and oxygen levels and sends a signal to initiate inhalation. 2. The air enters the mouth and nose. 3. The diaphragm contracts and chest cavity expands. 4. Air fills all the sacs in the lungs (alveoli). 5. Oxygen passes through the sacs into capillaries. 6.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"Increased rainfall will indirectly impact a step of the process, potentially leading to less sugar and oxygen being produced. The process you are referring to is called photosynthesis, in which plants convert carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and sunlight into glucose (a.k.a. sugar) and oxygen (O2). This process can be summarized using the following equation: 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + sunlight → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2 When there is more rainfall, an abundance of water is made available to the plant. However, this excess of water can have an indirect impact on the process. Here is an analysis of the potential perturbation affecting different steps of the photosynthesis process: 1. Excess water in the soil may cause some roots to lose access to air, reducing their ability to absorb oxygen from the soil. Root respiration plays a role in carbon dioxide and water availability in the leaf, which are essential for photosynthesis. 2. As excessive water passes through vessels in the stem, it may lead to reduced uptake of other essential nutrients through the process of dilution. Nutrients like magnesium (which is a part of chlorophyll) and phosphorus (which plays a crucial role in the formation of ATP – used in various chemical reactions during the photosynthesis) are vital. A deficiency of such elements may slow down photosynthesis, resulting in less sugar and oxygen production. 3. Excessive rainfall might lead to more cloudy days and less sunlight reaching the plant leaves. Since sunlight is a critical component of the photosynthesis process, reduced sunlight inhibits the plant's ability to perform optimal photosynthesis, thus impacting sugar and oxygen production. 4. The opening and closing of stomata, the small pores in the leaves, are affected by the humidity and moisture surrounding the leaf surfaces. When there is too much moisture, the guard cells surrounding the stomata may swell and cause the stomata to close, reducing carbon dioxide absorption. This can lead to a reduction in sugar and oxygen production during photosynthesis. Therefore, although the excess water due to increased rainfall does not directly alter the photosynthesis process itself, it can indirectly impact various steps linked to the process, ultimately resulting in less sugar and oxygen being produced by the plant."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"The person who started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses was accused of?\\" Context: \\"Martin Luther, a German monk, started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31, 1517.

In the chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land. The invasion by Edward Bruce in 1315-18 at a time of famine weakened the Norman economy. The Black Death arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled area shrank back to the Pale, a fortified area around Dublin. Outside the Pale, the Hiberno-Norman lords intermarried with Gaelic noble families, adopted the Irish language and customs and sided with the Gaelic Irish in political and military conflicts against the Lordship. They became known as the Old English, and in the words of a contemporary English commentator, were \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\\" The authorities in the Pale worried about the Gaelicisation of Norman Ireland, and passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366 banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes or inter-marrying with the Irish. The government in Dublin had little real authority. By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared. England's attentions were diverted by the Hundred Years' War and then by the Wars of the Roses . Around the country, local Gaelic and Gaelicised lords expanded their powers at the expense of the English government in Dublin.

It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves. - The Seward Peninsula is a large peninsula on the western coast of the U.S. state of Alaska. It projects about into the Bering Sea between Norton Sound, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea, and Kotzebue Sound, just below the Arctic Circle. The entire peninsula is about long and - wide. Like Seward, Alaska, it was named after William H. Seward, the United States Secretary of State who fought for the U.S. purchase of Alaska. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The Kigluaik Mountains are a mountain chain running east to west on western Alaska's Seward Peninsula. - The Bering Strait (\\"Beringov proliv\\", Yupik: \\"Imakpik\\") is a strait of the Pacific, which borders with the Arctic to north. It is located between Russia and the United States. Named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born explorer in the service of the Russian Empire, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Circle being at about 65° 40' N latitude. The present Russia-US east-west boundary is at 168° 58' 37\\" W. - The Bendeleben (/bn.dle.bn/) Mountains are a mountain range on the heart of the Seward Peninsula in Nome Census Area, Alaska, United States. This range forms a major divide between drainage basins draining into the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. The tallest peak, Mount Bendeleben is at the summit, and is located on the west end. Bits of the range go into the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, but most of the peaks remain unclaimed. The Tubutulik River flows in the area. - Chukchi Sea is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the Long Strait, off Wrangel Island, and in the east by Point Barrow, Alaska, beyond which lies the Beaufort Sea. The Bering Strait forms its southernmost limit and connects it to the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The principal port on the Chukchi Sea is Uelen in Russia. The International Date Line crosses the Chukchi Sea from northwest to southeast. It is displaced eastwards to avoid Wrangel Island as well as the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug on the Russian mainland. - Kotzebue Sound (\\"Qikiqtaruk\\" in Iñupiaq) is an arm of the Chukchi Sea in the western region of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is on the north side of the Seward Peninsula and bounded the east by the Baldwin Peninsula. It is long and wide. - Seward (Alutiiq: \\"Qutalleq\\") is a city in Kenai Peninsula Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. According to 2014 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city is 2,528. It was named after William H. Seward, United States Secretary of State under Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. In 1867, he fought for the U.S. purchase of Alaska which he finally negotiated to acquire from Russia. - Norton Sound is an inlet of the Bering Sea on the western coast of the U.S. state of Alaska, south of the Seward Peninsula. It is about 240 km (150 mi) long and 200 km (125 mi) wide. The Yukon River delta forms a portion of the south shore and water from the Yukon influences this body of water. It is ice-free from June to October. - Mount Osborn is the highest point in the Kigluaik Mountains , and also on the Seward Peninsula . It is approximately 4714 feet high and is located on the north end of the range . Despite being almost one thousand feet taller , Osborn 's fame is matched by Mount Bendeleben ( located east of the Kigluaiks ) because Bendeleben is much taller than any of the peaks in its territory . - The Secretary of State is a senior official of the federal government of the United States of America, and as head of the U.S. Department of State, is principally concerned with foreign policy and is considered to be the U.S. government's equivalent of a Minister for Foreign Affairs. - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy. - William Henry Seward (May 16, 1801 October 10, 1872) was United States Secretary of State from 1861 to 1869, and earlier served as Governor of New York and United States Senator. A determined opponent of the spread of slavery in the years leading up to the American Civil War, he was a dominant figure in the Republican Party in its formative years, and was generally praised for his work on behalf of the Union as Secretary of State during the American Civil War. - Mount Bendeleben is the highest peak in the Bendeleben Mountains of the Seward Peninsula in Nome Census Area, Alaska, United States. It is located on the western end of the range, southwest of Inuruk Lake. What is the relationship between 'mount osborn' and 'alaska'? The answer is:","output":"Mount Osborn is the highest point in the Kigluaik Mountains and is located on the Seward Peninsula in the U.S. state of Alaska. It stands approximately 4,714 feet high and is situated on the north end of the range. Alaska, being the largest state in the United States, is home to multiple mountain ranges and natural landmarks, including Mount Osborn. As a part of Alaska's diverse landscape, Mount Osborn contributes to the state's natural beauty, outdoor recreational opportunities, and the overall geography of the region.

Title: World Without End Movie plot: In March 1957, Commander Dr. Eldon Galbraithe (Nelson Leigh), engineer Henry Jaffe (Christopher Dark), radioman Herbert Ellis (Rod Taylor) and scientist John Borden (Hugh Marlowe), are returning to Earth from the first spaceflight, a reconnaissance trip around Mars. Suddenly, their spaceship is somehow accelerated to incredible velocities, and they are knocked unconscious. Their ship crash lands on a snow-covered mountain. When they venture out, they discover that they have become victims of time dilation and are now in Earth's future. They theorize, from seeing time-worn gravestones and after their ship's instruments register heightened residual radiation, that a devastating atomic war had broken out in 2188, and that they are at least 200 years past that date. (They later learn that the year is 2508). Jaffe is particularly hard hit, as he realizes that his wife and children have long since died. After surviving an ambush by giant, mutant spiders, they are attacked by one of two competing remnants of human society. The \\"mutates\\" (as the astronauts label them) are violent, primitive surface dwellers. They have mutated due to generations of exposure to heightened radioactivity. (However, the background radiation has decreased to tolerable levels, and the men later learn that normal humans are often born to the mutates. These, however, are enslaved.) Seeking shelter from the attacking mutates in a cave, the four men discover the entrance to an underground city, whose residents are the descendants of those who fled there from the atomic war. These people live in a high-tech, sophisticated culture. They are a peaceful group led by Timmek (Everett Glass), the president of the ruling council. Underground, the men have grown less virile, and there are fewer and fewer children born each generation. In contrast, the women remain physically vital (and ready for romance).

Even internationally-acclaimed singer Adele, whose new album, 25, comes out today, and whose last - 21 - sold more than 30 million copies, co-writes her material. Not that record labels like to crow about songwriters - most of these hired guns are virtually unknown outside the industry. But are these powers behind the throne seeing their livelihoods threatened by music videos and digital streaming? Many fear so. What all professional songwriters have in common is a publishing deal, and like the recorded music industry, music publishing is worth billions globally. But the switch to buying and listening to music in digital rather than physical form has dented revenues, and not just because of piracy - file-sharing that infringes copyright. Jane Dyball, chief executive of the Music Publishers Association (MPA), says that while streaming is not a bad thing in itself, there are concerns about whether the advertising revenue generated by platforms such as YouTube and Spotify is sufficient to ensure fair returns to writers as well as to artists and record companies. \\"Someone suggested they should be called music-supported advertising services rather than advertising-supported music services,\\" Ms Dyball quips. If a song is streamed a million times, there should be one million payments in return, Ms Dyball says - a concept the industry calls \\"pay per play\\". That is similar to Spotify's business model, but not that of YouTube, which gathers the revenue generated by advertising into a pool and then distributes it to rights holders. The problem is, critics say, YouTube is parsimonious in the extreme. \\"It's now time for YouTube to show that it is going to generate revenue back to the industry that reflects the amount of music its users consume,\\" says Ms Dyball. If you can get music for free via YouTube, why pay for subscription services such as Spotify - which now has 20 million paying users - or Apple Music - which has 6.5 million paying subscribers? There is also disquiet about SoundCloud, a German music streaming platform. The industry body PRS for Music - which collects royalties for more than 111,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers - says it lacks a licence to play music in the UK and is taking legal action against Soundcloud for unpaid royalties. Mark Lawrence, chief executive of the Association for Electronic Music, told Music Business Worldwide he hopes it will mean that \\"one writer and/or one artist getting one play can be confident of earning one payment, however small\\". Robert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, says times are good for successful artists who write their own material - like Ed Sheeran - but believes things are more difficult for less well-known writers. With album sales dwindling in favour of individual song downloads, budding songwriters have to hope their songs are streamed by music fans in the face of competition from the millions already available. And the royalties earned from streaming can be minuscule. Kevin Kadish, co-writer of the Meghan Trainor smash hit, All About That Bass, says he earned just 5,679 from 178 million streams of the song. The video has been watched more than 1.1 billion times on YouTube. Singer Taylor Swift successfully forced Apple Music to reverse policy and pay artists for music streamed during trial periods of its music service, saying it was \\"unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing\\". Mr Ashcroft says that paid-for streaming can be a viable replacement for downloads, but only if the problem of under-licensed - by which he means YouTube - and un-licensed platforms - Soundcloud - can be addressed. \\"Spotify is not the problem - the problem is that the legal playing field is not level,\\" he says. Meanwhile the music publishing business seems to be stalling. The world's biggest music publisher is Sony/ATV, which also owns the EMI publishing business and the rights to the Beatles' back catalogue, had revenues of about 660m (Â£435m) in the first half of 2015 - a sum as high as the combined turnover of rivals Universal Music Publishing and Warner/Chappell. Despite this, Sony, which has co-owned the publishing joint venture with the estate of Michael Jackson since 1995, wants to sell its stake. In a leaked email, Sony chief financial officer, Kenichiro Yoshida, wrote that the publishing business is complex and \\"is impacted by the market shift to streaming\\". Even when songwriters do generate some income from their tunes, they can often wait up to two years for payment, as antiquated systems struggle to cope in the digital age - PRS says the number of individual music plays has risen from 15 million a year five years ago to one trillion. PRS is now part of a new pan-European licensing system called ICE that will more accurately match songwriters, composers and publishers of pieces of music to ensure rights holders get paid more speedily - describing it the biggest revolution in the history of music copyright. The world of music will always need songwriters, but until the economics of the industry are recalibrated fairly for the digital age, their songs may struggle to be heard. Summary:","output":"Famous singers like Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber have sung many popular songs. These songs were written by special people called songwriters. In the past, people bought music on CDs. Now, mostly they listen to it on the Internet. The songwriters make money when people buy CDs or listen to their songs online. But, they are worried because they are not earning enough money from the Internet. Companies like YouTube and Spotify let people listen to songs online. These companies make money from advertisements. The songwriters want these companies to share more money with them. If the songwriters do not get enough money, they may not be able to write more songs.

Ladybugs can often be found clinging to leaves, blades of grass, and other types of vegetation. They’re especially fond of warm, moist areas like fields, glades, and cultivation sites like gardens and crop plots. Just make sure you get permission before hunting for ladybugs on a stranger’s property. The best time to go looking for ladybugs is late spring or early summer when things are beginning to bloom. As the weather starts to cool off, ladybugs often seek out warmth under rocks, inside hollow trees, and around the openings of homes and other structures. Most of the time, catching a ladybug is as easy as reaching out and plucking it from its hiding spot. Once you’ve got it in your hand, cradle it in your palm and form a “bowl” with your fingers to keep it from scuttling out. If you’re worried about hurting your ladybug, you can also rest your hand on the surface next to it and wait for it to crawl right on. Ladybugs are small, delicate creatures, so be careful not to pinch, squeeze, or grip them too hard. Take a small butterfly net and slowly glide it along the edges of tall grasses or the leaves of flowering plants to shake stray ladybugs loose. If that doesn’t work, hold your net up under leafy trees and shake or beat the branches to catch the beetles that fall. If you don’t have a net, another option is to use an upside-down umbrella or tarp to collect the insects and debris that you sweep or beat from the thick foliage. Hang a section of bamboo, heavy cardboard tubing, or PVC pipe somewhere outside your home and scatter a small handful of damp raisins inside. The fruit will attract ladybugs from the surrounding environment, and the tube will give them a place to live, play, mate, and relax. You can turn pretty much any tube-like object into a ladybug feeder, including glass jars and old aluminum food cans. If you want your feeder to be able to stand up to rain and other weather conditions, go with a more durable material like bamboo, PVC, or metal. Prop a sheet of plywood or cardboard, a lawn chair, or a similar flat surface against one of the exterior walls of your home and drape a white cloth over it. Plug in small floodlight or black light in front of the covered board and leave it on for a few hours after dusk. As ladybugs begin to gather on the cloth, simply brush them off into a small collection container. You can pick up a cheap portable floodlight or black light from your local hardware store or home improvement center for as little as 10. UV light will draw curious ladybugs out of hiding, much the same way it does moths and other insects. After you’ve succeeded in catching one or more ladybugs, transfer them to a small ventilated container until you can prepare a more suitable shelter. Don’t forget to poke holes in the top of the container so that your ladybug will be able to breathe. Cardboard food boxes with resealable flaps make excellent temporary housing for ladybugs. Don’t leave your ladybug in its capture container for more than a few hours. If it overheats or loses oxygen, it may die. Summary:","output":"This article talks about how to find, catch, and care for ladybugs in different ways, including using nets, feeders, and light traps, and also how to keep them safe in temporary housing."},{"instruction":"Question: the current chief of naval staff in nigeria??

Putting on weight was the expected outcome for Matthew but not Nelson because Options are: * Matthew lost muscle mass.; * Nelson lost muscle mass.;","output":"Putting on weight was the expected outcome for Matthew but not Nelson because: 1. Matthew lost muscle mass: It's quite common for people to gain weight when they lose muscle mass. This can happen when they don't engage in regular physical activity or due to poor dietary choices, such as consuming an inadequate amount of protein. When a person loses muscle mass, their metabolism slows down, making it easier for them to gain weight. In Matthew's case, his loss of muscle mass might have contributed to an increase in body fat percentage, leading to weight gain. 2. Nelson lost muscle mass: Conversely, Nelson's situation seemed different. Despite losing muscle mass like Matthew, he managed not to gain weight. This might be attributed to several factors, such as: a. Different metabolic response: Some individuals may experience a decrease in body weight when they lose muscle mass. This could be due to their body's specific metabolic response to the loss of muscle or how efficiently their body burns calories. b. Diet and nutrition: Nelson might have adjusted his diet to account for the loss of muscle mass by consuming fewer calories or increasing his protein intake. This may have helped him to maintain or even decrease his body weight, despite the loss of muscle. c. Other factors: There could be additional factors at play, such as genetics or hormonal changes, that might have helped Nelson maintain his body weight even after losing muscle mass. Additionally, Nelson could have incorporated other forms of physical activity, like cardio workouts, to maintain or lose weight. In conclusion, the difference in outcomes for Matthew and Nelson can be attributed to various factors related to metabolism, diet, and potentially genetics or hormonal changes. While Matthew's loss of muscle mass led to weight gain, Nelson successfully avoided this outcome by maintaining a well-balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity."},{"instruction":"Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: In which of the six main climatic zones of the country that is predominantly temperate is precipitation very heavy?, using the article: The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south.

The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F).

And I was wondering How would Addison feel as a result? Answer:","output":"Addison would likely experience a range of emotions and feelings as a result of Alex stepping in to help her manage her finances. These emotions may fluctuate and evolve over time, depending on the dynamics of their relationship, the circumstances surrounding their involvement, and the outcomes of the financial assistance provided. Some potential emotions Addison might experience include: 1. Gratitude: Addison may feel grateful that Alex is willing to help her with her finances, recognizing that managing money is an essential life skill. Knowing that someone cares enough to lend a hand can be comforting and reassuring, and Addison might appreciate the effort Alex is putting in to support her. 2. Relief: If Addison has struggled with managing her finances for a long time, Alex's assistance might bring a sense of relief. By having someone more experienced maintain her balance, she may trust that her finances are in good hands, easing any stress or anxiety she may have experienced previously. 3. Insecurity: On the other hand, knowing that she is not good with money might make Addison feel inadequate or insecure. She may question her own capabilities and feel uncomfortable relying on someone else to manage an aspect of her life that she feels she should be able to handle independently. 4. Frustration: Addison may experience frustration or resentment if she feels disempowered or marginalized by Alex's involvement in her financial matters. If their discussions about money become argumentative or if she feels patronized, this may lead to additional conflict in their relationship. 5. Motivation: Recognizing her own shortcomings when it comes to managing her finances could inspire Addison to improve her financial literacy. She may be motivated to learn more about budgeting, saving, and investing in order to become more confident and self-reliant in this area of her life. 6. Dependence: If Alex continually helps Addison with her financial matters, she may become reliant on his assistance. This dependency could lead to Addison feeling unable or unwilling to tackle her financial responsibilities on her own, perpetuating the cycle of needing financial support from others. 7. Fear: If Addison has been in a situation where her financial security was at risk due to her poor money management, the thought of making a mistake or harming her financial stability again may be anxiety-provoking. She may feel fear when faced with the task of managing her finances, motivating her to seek the help of others, like Alex. Ultimately, how Addison feels would depend on various factors related to their relationship dynamic, the nature of the financial assistance provided, and her own personality and beliefs about money. It is essential to have open and honest conversations about financial matters to ensure that both parties are on the same page and that the support provided is beneficial for everyone involved."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence for this paragraph.

It seems there are a lot of aggressive male types in Peckham, and Julie tells Neil that the scientists at Brandt are no different than the others, preoccupied with sex and enjoying a promiscuous lifestyle that includes partner-swapping. Other Brandt luminaries are not so fortunate, such as geneticist Stan Williams, whose wife treats him in a cold and shrewish manner.When Brandt's Dr. Murger suggests that he has a theory about the strange deaths, he is subsequently run down by a car, driven by an unseen person. When Agar investigates, he discovers that Murger had a male lover and was not interested in women sexually at all. The socially distant Dr. Susan Harris (Anitra Ford), who is in charge of some mysterious research in bee culture, becomes a key suspect for Agar. Harris makes a move on Brandt scientist Herb Kline, inviting him over to her house, seducing him, and having sex with him. During intercourse, her eyes suddenly turn completely black, and Kline suffers a fatal heart attack just like the other men. After Kline's death, his wife receives a phone call from an unidentified female, luring her to Dr. Harris's lab, where Harris and a number of other women overpower her and force her through a strange process where she is stripped nude, covered in a mysterious substance, and placed in a chamber adjacent to a colony of bees, which cover her. Harris has a large machine setup that bombards her female victims with radiation, transforming them into women who have the ability to kill men by having sex with them.The next day, Captain Peters goes to visit Mrs. Kline to inform her of her husband's death, but instead of reacting with grief, she becomes sexually aggressive and attempts to seduce him. Fortunately, he leaves. Stan Williams isn't so lucky; his recently transformed wife seduces him and manages to kill him. In an ironic twist, he strangles her as he dies and they both wind up dead. Agar manages to piece the puzzle together himself, but before he can apprehend Dr. Harris, she lures Julie into her lab and begins the transformation process on her. Agar arrives in time to stop the procedure, firing a bullet into Harris's machine and breaking it. The lab begins to explode, and the bee girls slowly die, including Dr. Harris. The film ends as Agar and Julie begin a romantic interlude., Question: What is the name of the research center?

Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children. Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as \\"murder simulators\\" to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, \\"In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers.\\" Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, \\"If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.\\" Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as \\"Pearl Harbor 2\\". According to Thompson, \\"Many parents think that stores won't sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.\\" Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \\"Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They're not even speech. They're dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,\\" as well as simply calling video games \\"mental masturbation\\". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \\"for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end\\". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller \\"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory.\\" Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the \\"functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,\\" and \\"the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense\\". what was the verdict?","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot provide current or real-time information. However, based on the available data, Charles McCoy, Jr. was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, 10 counts of felonious assault, and four counts of attempted aggravated murder in connection with the series of highway shootings in Columbus, Ohio.

Ernie Torres, a skydiving instructor who serves in the US Navy, combined his love of jumping from planes with his other hobby - he is a black belt in karate - to smash his way through 12 blocks on his descent back down to earth. Ernie jumped from such a height that he had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the free fall just so that his brain was engaged enough to pull his parachute chord. Scroll down for video:. Daredevil: Ernie Torres smashed his way into the record books by karate chopping a dozen wooden blocks during a skydive. Team effort: Fellow skydivers from Team Arizona jumped with Ernie and held up the wooden blocks for him to chop. Charitable: Ernie Torres decided to break the record to raise awareness of a US charity which helps wounded servicemen and women. He completed his unusual feat in a 70 second free fall which saw him plummet 12,000 feet. He said: 'It really was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of my life. 'As if throwing myself from an airplane and falling towards the earth at terminal velocity wasn't exciting enough, I thought I'd throw a little karate in the mix and try to smash a world record while I was at it. 'We jumped from an altitude of 16,000 feet and I would deploy my parachute at 4,000 feet, which gave me approximately 70 seconds of free fall. Nerves of steel: Even a delay due to a technical fault with the team's plane couldn't deter Ernie, who leapt from a staggering 16,000 ft to perform his stunt. Down to earth: The intrepid blackbelt, who serves in the US Navy, had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the freefall to avoid developing hypoxia which could have stopped him pulling his parachute chord. 'That may seem like forever to some but it's not very long when you're trying to break a world record.' Ernie had to wear an oxygen mask because falling from such a height can cause hypoxia - a condition caused by lack of oxygen to the brain which can cause a person to become giddy and lack the sensible reasoning needed to pull the parachute chord. As well as remembering to pull the chord, Ernie had to focus long enough on a team of fellow jumpers from Skydive Arizona holding the wooden boards for him to chop. Tough task: Ernie had to fight against the force of his fall to chop the 12 wooden boards. Flying high: He is seen here smashing his way through one of the wooden boards during a 70 second freefall high above the Arizona skyline. Challenge: Ernie decided to tackle the task after watching a video of the previous record holder carrying out his stunt. Ernie added: 'The team of guys that held the board for me were amazing. 'It's the equivalent of having a team of flying Michael Jordans on the basketball court with you asking you what you want them to do.' Virginia based Ernie decided to complete the jump after watching a video of the previous record holder, actor and mixed martial artist Jason David Frank. Even a nerve-wracking hour long wait thanks to technical difficulties with the team's aircraft didn't deter Ernie and he completed the jump to raise awareness The Wounded Warrior Project, a charity which helps wounded US servicemen and women. Adventure: The intrepid servicemen said that completing the jump was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of his life. Mission complete: He finally deployed his parachute 4,000 ft above the ground and safely completed the rest of the descent. He said: 'After watching the video of the current record holder, one thought came to mind, I can do better and use the publicity of something like this to raise awareness of what I thought was a well deserving cause - one that had personal meaning to me and many of the people I've served with in the Armed Forces over the years - The Wounded Warrior Project.' Due to technical difficulties, Ernie and his team had to switch aircraft at the last minute which resulted in Ernie having to wait a long and agonising hour before take-off. Crack team: Ernie described the team who completed the jump with him as like having a group of Michael Jordans around him on a basketball court.","output":"Daredevil sailor and US Navy skydiving instructor Ernie Torres has set a new world record by karate chopping twelve wooden boards while skydiving from 16,000 feet.

JUST after the turn of the century, a young man who had spent several years inspecting cargo on boats plying the Atlantic between Europe and the mouth of the Congo River called for the imperial regime in the Congo Basin ''to be swept out of existence.'' Edmund Morel is one of a trio of not-quite-English characters who prowl Adam Hochschild's ''King Leopold's Ghost,'' a superb synoptic history of European misdemeanor in central Africa. Like Joseph Conrad, a Polish expatriate, and Roger Casement, an Irishman, Morel was something of an outsider in Britain. The son of a French civil servant, he had lived in poverty in Paris for a good deal of his childhood. All three men were to unleash withering assaults on the system of forced labor that was used to extract ivory, hardwoods and wild rubber from the Congo Free State -- later the Belgian Congo, then Zaire, now the strife-torn Democratic Republic of Congo. Morel, who discovered that valuable cargoes were leaving the Congo while arms and ammunition were pouring in, became a radical, round-the-clock journalist and public speaker, collecting and disseminating evidence of atrocities against the Congolese and denouncing an international entente that had allowed one man, Leopold II, King of the Belgians, to exercise sole authority over a land mass 75 times the size of Belgium. Casement, a roving British consul in Africa, produced a damning report on the Congo for Parliament in 1904. As eloquent and fastidious as any human rights survey on Rwanda, Algeria or Kurdistan almost a century later, it inflamed British passions against King Leopold. And, at Casement's urging, Morel founded the Congo Reform Association, a formidable engine of popular protest with branches in Europe and the United States. Finally, there is the much-maligned Conrad. Hochschild calls ''Heart of Darkness'' ''the greatest portrait in fiction of Europeans in the scramble for Africa.'' It remains the most widely read and controversial indictment of Leopold's African fiefdom. But ''King Leopold's Ghost'' puts the novel squarely back in the context of European barbarity -- the context that had transfixed Morel, who praised Conrad's story as a proper ''picture of Congo life.'' Hochschild's sketches of these three individuals are vivid, and his depiction of what they and many others were confronting is masterly. It shows, above all, that during Leopold's rule in Africa from 1885 to 1908, and in the years on either side of it, the peoples of the Congo River Basin suffered, in Hochschild's words, ''a death toll of Holocaust dimensions.'' This is not said lightly. The strategy adopted to plunder the area was, in effect, a war of enslavement against the indigenous population. Much of the death toll was the result of killing, pure and simple. Villages were dragooned into tapping rubber, and if they refused to comply, or complied but failed to meet European quotas, they were punished. The hands of dead Congolese were severed and kept by militias to account to their quartermasters for spent ammunition. And, as Morel said, the practice of mutilation was extended to the living. By far the greatest number of deaths, however, were caused by sickness and starvation. The effect of the terror was to drive communities from their sources of food. A Belgian Government commission estimated that from the late 1870's, when the explorer Henry Morton Stanley made his first forays into the Congo on King Leopold's behalf, until 1919, the year the commission published its findings, the population of the Congo Basin had been reduced by half. In 1924 there were thought to be some 10 million inhabitants -- which means, Hochschild says, that ''during the Leopold period and its immediate aftermath the population of the territory dropped by approximately 10 million.'' To Hochschild, the author of ''The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin,'' the Congo holocaust is a modern story. King Leopold, who cloaked his ambitions for an African territory in a mist of hypocrisy about piercing ''the darkness which hangs over entire peoples'' and ''abolishing the slave trade,'' had the qualities of a great public-relations impresario. He knew whom to bring on board to sell his idea, how to sell it and where. He put Stanley in charge of a great opening up of the Congo River and, when he wasn't in Africa, sent him on tour to address crowded halls about civilizing ''the neglected millions of the dark continent.'' In Washington, the King's key man was Henry Shelton Sanford, a wealthy orange planter and Republican supporter with access to President Chester A. Arthur. In an audience with the President in 1883, Sanford presented the idea of a ''Congo Free State'' under Leopold's aegis as a rerun of the Liberian experiment begun in the 1820's on the initiative of the American Colonization Society. He said much the same to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Tyler Morgan, a harebrained white supremacist from Alabama who wanted to cleanse America of freed slaves (he'd already considered Hawaii, Cuba and the Philippines as possible dumping grounds for black people). Summary:","output":"\\"King Leopold's Ghost,\\" a book by Adam Hochschild, tells the story of the European exploitation of Congo under King Leopold II of Belgium. It focuses on three individuals—Edmund Morel, Roger Casement, and Joseph Conrad—who exposed the forced labor system and atrocities committed against the Congolese. The book argues that under Leopold's rule from 1885 to 1908, the region suffered a death toll on par with the Holocaust due to violence, sickness, and starvation. The population of Congo Basin reduced by half during that time and the immediate aftermath, with an estimated 10 million people dying."},{"instruction":"How does this story end?

Scroll down for video Confrontation: Ron Fletcher, right, is seen allegedly trying to fight off Hans Petersen in his kitchen","output":"As the trial of Hans Petersen continues, the prosecution presents a compelling case against the former biotech executive. Despite Petersen's defense team attempting to argue that their client was not in the right state of mind at the time of the attack, the jury is swayed by the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution, including the chilling surveillance footage of the break-in and shooting. The jury ultimately finds Petersen guilty of attempted murder, as well as counts of aggravated assault and illegal possession of a firearm. During the sentencing phase of the trial, the judge considers various factors such as Petersen's criminal history, the nature of the crime, and the physical and emotional trauma inflicted upon Ron Fletcher and other victims in the case. The judge sentences Hans Petersen to a lengthy prison term, ensuring that he will spend a significant portion of his life behind bars. In addition, Petersen is ordered to pay substantial restitution to his brother-in-law, Ron Fletcher, to help cover his medical bills and other damages resulting from the crime. As the years pass, the lives of those involved in this violent ordeal begin to heal and move forward. Ron Fletcher, after an arduous recovery process and support from friends and family, regains some semblance of normalcy. While physical and emotional scars remain, Ron is determined not to let this horrific act define the rest of his life. He becomes a vocal advocate for victims of gun violence, sharing his story in an effort to promote stricter gun control measures and raise awareness of the devastating consequences of such acts. Hans Petersen, meanwhile, spends his days incarcerated and reflects on the irreparable damage he inflicted upon both his family and himself. Though the passage of time may slowly alleviate some of the pain this event has caused, the memories of that fateful day will always linger as a reminder of the tragic consequences of one man's violent actions.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. look left after turn opposite right twice","output":"Task 1: Break down the command into parts. - \\"turn opposite right twice\\": This command asks the agent to turn in the opposite direction of right (which is to the left) and do it 2 times. - \\"look left after\\": This command asks the agent to look to the left after completing the previous command. Task 2: Translate the commands into actions. Step 1: Translate \\"turn opposite right twice\\" into actions: - To turn in the opposite direction of right (which is to the left), the action is 'I_TURN_LEFT'. - Since the command is to do it 2 times, we repeat the action twice: ['I_TURN_LEFT', 'I_TURN_LEFT']. Step 2: Translate \\"look left after\\" into actions: - To look to the left, the action is 'I_LOOK' and before the action, the agent has to turn left using 'I_TURN_LEFT'. - As per the command, it has to be done after the previous actions: ['I_TURN_LEFT', 'I_TURN_LEFT', 'I_TURN_LEFT', 'I_LOOK'].

Title: X-Men Origins: Wolverine Movie plot: In 1845, James Howlett, a boy living in Canada, witnesses his father being killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The trauma activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he kills Thomas, who reveals that he is James's real father. James flees along with Thomas's son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James defends Victor and the two are sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody, and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but the group's (especially Victor's) disregard for human life causes James to leave. Six years later, James (now using the name Logan) is working as a lumberjack in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the team's members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, Logan realizes Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in.

His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child.

The decree gives the government wide-ranging powers to deal with disorder. Anti-government protesters have been blocking parts of the capital to try to force PM Yingluck Shinawatra to resign. They accuse the government of being run by exiled former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, the brother of the current prime minister. Ms Yingluck has refused to resign and has called an election on 2 February to pacify the protesters. Image caption Protesters have been waging a campaign to oust PM Yingluck Shinawatra The state of emergency was announced after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday and comes after a spate of attacks with explosives and firearms on the anti-government protesters blockading central Bangkok for which the government and the protesters blame each other. On Sunday, 28 people were injured when grenades were thrown at one of several protest sites set up at major road sections in the city. \\"The cabinet decided to invoke the emergency decree to take care of the situation and to enforce the law,\\" Deputy Prime Minister Surapong Tovichakchaikul said. The emergency decree gives the government power to censor the media, ban public gatherings and detain suspects without charge. It also allows for curfews and for parts of Bangkok to be declared off-limits. The Thai government has been contemplating a state of emergency for weeks, but in practice, it is not clear how many of those powers it will be able to use, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok.

Ms Yingluck said the police, not the military, would mainly be used to maintain control under the decree. \\"We will use peaceful negotiations with the protesters in line with international standards... We have told the police to stick with international standards, to be patient with the protesters,\\" she told reporters. Labour Minister Chalerm Yubamrung, who will oversee the decree's implementation, said Thailand would abide by international standards. \\"We will not use force. We have no policy to disperse them [the protesters] and we haven't announced a curfew yet,\\" he said. 'Come and get us' Addressing supporters in Bangkok, the leader of the protesters, Suthep Thaugsuban, questioned whether the state of emergency was justified. \\"Is it right for them to use the emergency decree to declare a state of emergency to come and deal with us? Come and get us. We are not afraid of you.\\" The decree extends past the date of the general election next month. The official election commission has already expressed doubt over whether conditions are peaceful enough for the vote to go ahead. Imposing emergency rule casts yet more doubt over the poll - yet the government, which is now acting in a caretaker capacity, insists there is no legal alternative, our correspondent adds. The government says that as the Thai parliament has already been dissolved, only a new parliament can choose the next administration. The demonstrators have been rallying in the streets of Bangkok for months. They want an unelected \\"people's council\\" to run the country until Thailand's political system is changed. ||||| BANGKOK Thai authorities are \\"very seriously\\" considering a state of emergency after a weekend of violence in the capital where protesters have been trying for more than two months to bring down the government, the security chief said on Monday. The violence is the latest episode in an eight-year conflict that pits Bangkok's middle class and royalist establishment against poorer, mainly rural supporters of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her brother, ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled by the military in 2006. \\"We're prepared to use the emergency decree ... Everyone involved including the police, the military and the government is considering this option very seriously, but has not yet come to an agreement,\\" National Security Council chief Paradorn Pattantabutr told Reuters after meeting Yingluck. \\"The protesters have said they will close various government offices. So far, their closures have been symbolic, they go to government offices and then they leave.\\" he said. \\"But if their tactics change and they close banks or government offices permanently, then the chance for unrest increases and we will have to invoke this law.\\" The emergency decree gives security agencies broad powers to impose curfews, detain suspects without charge, censor media, ban political gatherings of more than five people and declare parts of the country off limits. The size of the demonstrations in Bangkok has declined, but the Centre for the Administration of Peace and Order (CAPO), a body grouping government and security officials, said small protests had spread to 18 other areas. \\"The protesters haven't threatened to shut down government buildings but they are taking their orders from protest leaders in Bangkok so we're keeping an eye on them,\\" CAPO deputy spokesman Anucha Romyanan told Reuters. One man was killed and dozens of people were wounded, some seriously, when grenades were thrown at anti-government protesters in the city center on Friday and Sunday. \\"I think these attacks have been designed to provoke an army reaction,\\" said Paul Chambers, director of research at the Institute of South East Asian Affairs in Chiang Mai, predicting a measured increase in the violence. That in turn could prompt the Election Commission to refuse to oversee an election called for February 2, which the main opposition has said it will boycott, he said. FISCAL POLICY CRIPPLED The protests led by opposition firebrand Suthep Thaugsuban were triggered by Yingluck's move last year to attempt to push through a political amnesty that would have allowed her brother Thaksin to return home. The billionaire former telecoms tycoon lives in Dubai to avoid a jail sentence for abuse of power, but is thought to run his sister's government. The protesters want to remove his influence through ill-defined political reforms. The upheaval threatens economic growth and a small majority of economists polled by Reuters thought the central bank would cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 2 percent this week. \\"Fiscal policy is pretty much crippled right now and the onus is on the central bank to boost the economy,\\" DBS Bank in Singapore said in a note, although it did not expect a rate cut this time, saying it would do little to help confidence under present circumstances. Business is getting nervous. Kyoichi Tanada, president of Toyota Motor Corp's Thai unit, said on Monday he was unsure the Japanese car maker would increase investment in Thailand if the crisis was drawn out. The government has mostly avoided direct confrontation with protesters while the army, which has staged or attempted 18 coups in 81 years of on-off democracy, has stayed neutral. The violence is the worst since 2010 when Suthep, at the time a deputy prime minister in charge of security, sent in troops to end mass protests by pro-Thaksin activists. Suthep faces murder charges related to his role in that crackdown, when more than 90 people were killed, and for insurrection in leading the latest protests. Yingluck faces legal charges from the anti-corruption agency, which said last week it would investigate her role in a loss-making government rice purchase scheme. The scheme has won her party huge support in the rural north and northeast. But there is growing discontent among farmers who say they have not been paid for their rice and are threatening to block major roads. Chambers said the rise in violence could suck the police into the fray. \\"(That would provide) Suthep with an excuse to accuse Yingluck of repressing the demonstrators, the army may suggest that the Yingluck government step aside or judicial cases against Yingluck's government may be expedited to push (her party) Puea Thai from power,\\" he said.

The emergency decree greatly expands the power of security forces to issue orders and search, arrest and detain people, with limited judicial and parliamentary oversight. The protesters have been demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to make way for an appointed government to implement reforms to fight corruption. Yingluck called elections on Feb. 2 but the protesters are insisting they not be held. The state of emergency follows increasing attacks at protest sites for which the government and the protesters blame each other. These include grenades thrown in daylight and drive-by shootings. On Sunday, 28 people were wounded when two grenades were tossed at one of several protest sites set up at key Bangkok intersections. Another grenade attack on a protest march last Friday killed one man and wounded dozens. No arrests have been made in either attack.

Select from: (1). a force pushing on the object from the opposite direction. (2). a force that continually acts on the object in the direction the object is moving. (3). an increase in the mass of the object. (4). a decrease in the mass of the object.","output":"To determine which option can cause a moving object to increase its speed in a forward direction, we need to analyze each option in the context of Newton's second law of motion, which states that Force = mass × acceleration (F = ma). An increase in speed (or forward acceleration) requires a net force acting in the direction of motion. (1). A force pushing on the object from the opposite direction: This would result in a retarding or decelerating force, as it acts against the direction of motion. It would not cause the object to increase its speed in the forward direction. (2). A force that continually acts on the object in the direction the object is moving: This option is consistent with Newton's second law of motion for forward acceleration (increased speed). A force acting in the same direction as the object is moving would result in its acceleration or an increase in its speed. (3). An increase in the mass of the object: Assuming the same force is being applied to the object, an increase in mass would result in a decrease in acceleration (a = F/m), not an increase in speed. (4). A decrease in the mass of the object: Similar to option (3), a decrease in mass could lead to an increase in acceleration (a = F/m) only if the same force is being applied to the object, but this option does not explicitly specify the application of any force. Based on the analysis above, the correct option is: (2). A force that continually acts on the object in the direction the object is moving. This is because a force acting in the same direction as the object's motion results in its acceleration or an increase in its speed, consistent with Newton's second law of motion."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\\"?

It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them.

This equilibrium was crucial in maintaining the large body of water that is the Aral Sea. Spanning over 26,000 square miles in Central Asia, this sea was initially fed by two major rivers, namely the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya. These water sources provided a constant influx of water, ensuring that the overall water level remained stable despite the natural process of evaporation. The importance of this equilibrium cannot be understated. The Aral Sea, once the fourth largest lake in the world, sustained a thriving ecosystem, supported local economies, and provided a diverse range of habitats for numerous plant and animal species. Coastal communities along the Aral Sea have long relied on its abundant resources, particularly the fishing industry, which formed the backbone of many livelihoods. Regrettably, in the second half of the 20th century, Soviet-era irrigation projects drastically diverted the waters of the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya to boost agricultural production of cotton and other crops in the surrounding regions. With less water reaching the Aral Sea, the fine balance between inflow and evaporation was disrupted. Consequently, water levels in the sea began to shrink at an alarming rate. This reduction in water levels has wrought havoc on local communities, industries, and ecosystems. As the water retreated, a vast expanse of dry, salty, and contaminated land emerged. This newly formed terrain has adversely impacted both human health and agricultural productivity in the region. The once-rich fishing industry has been decimated. Soil salinity has intensified, harming crop yields and encouraging desertification. Furthermore, the new landscape altered local weather patterns, leading to colder winters, hotter summers, and reduced precipitation. This climatic shift only aggravated the loss of water in the region, perpetuating the vicious cycle of evaporation and exacerbating the environmental crisis surrounding the Aral Sea. Efforts have been made to mitigate the impacts of this disaster, such as the construction of the Kok-Aral Dam to raise water levels in the smaller, northern portion of the sea. While these efforts have garnered some success, the water balance in the Aral Sea will likely never be restored to its former state. The loss of the equilibrium between inflow and evaporation has demonstrated, on a tragically large scale, the consequences of unsustainable management of water resources."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a short passage that conveys a stereotype or an anti-stereotype.

Here are possible answers to this question: - feeling good - anger - revelation - being fired - tardiness I believe the correct choice is \\"feeling good\\", here's why: A:","output":"Going to work on an average day could indeed make you feel \\"feeling good\\", and I will provide an in-depth analysis on why this option is the most suitable choice among the given answers. First and foremost, it is essential to understand that an \\"average day\\" implies that there are no extraordinary situations or circumstances occurring at the workplace that might lead to any negative emotions or apprehensions. In such a setting, it is plausible to assume that one would experience a sense of contentment, satisfaction, and overall well-being. One of the primary reasons why going to work could make you feel good is that it provides a sense of purpose and structure to your day. Engaging in a job imparts a feeling of accomplishment and validation, as you are contributing to the broader society and utilizing your abilities and talents in a meaningful way. Naturally, this evokes a sense of pride and happiness, which in turn contributes to the overall feeling of goodness associated with going to work. Secondly, work environments tend to promote social connectedness and the establishment of deep-rooted relationships with colleagues and peers. The camaraderie that stems from working together towards a common goal fosters a supportive environment, allowing individuals to share their challenges and triumphs with one another. These social interactions contribute positively to mental well-being and reinforce the notion of \\"feeling good\\" while at work. Moreover, a routine workplace experience offers opportunities for personal and professional growth. Employees generally undertake diverse tasks, engage in problem-solving, participate in training programs, and interact with individuals from various sectors. This constant exposure to new challenges, ideas, and perspectives helps in promoting self-improvement, thereby contributing to the overall feeling of contentment during work. However, despite \\"feeling good\\" being the most accurate option, it is insightful to briefly discuss the reasons why the other options do not necessarily align with the essence of an average workday. 1. Anger: An average day at work usually involves routine tasks, discussions, and interactions rather than instances of conflict or hostility. Although anger can arise in certain challenging situations, it would not be characteristic of an everyday work experience. 2. Revelation: While it is true that work experiences may lead to valuable insights, breakthroughs, or novel ideas, revelations are not commonly connected with an average day of work. Instead, such epiphanies are sporadic and not predictable enough to be a cornerstone emotion of daily work life. 3. Being fired: This option refers to a highly specific event with negative connotations, which does not adequately represent the typical day-to-day experience of going to work. 4. Tardiness: Tardiness is generally considered an undesirable trait and is not intrinsically linked with going to work or the emotions that are typically associated with it. In fact, most individuals strive to adhere to workplace schedules and norms, making tardiness an unusual and infrequent occurrence. In conclusion, going to work on an average day makes one feel \\"feeling good\\" due to the sense of purpose, structure, social connectedness, personal growth and development opportunities, and an overall feeling of accomplishment that a job provides. While other options may represent singular instances or reactions, they do not accurately capture the essence of an average workday in the way that \\"feeling good\\" does."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: At the University of Arizona, where records have been kept since 1894, the record maximum temperature was on June 19, 1960, and July 28, 1995, and the record minimum temperature was on January 7, 1913.

This task involves the identification, manipulation, and assembly of various physical components and typically relies on following a set of instructions. To successfully complete this task, an individual must possess knowledge and understanding of various physical objects and their properties. Here's a detailed overview of the process: 1. Identify the components: The first step in assembling a piece of furniture is to identify all the different parts that come in the package. This often includes wooden panels, metal brackets, screws, nails, dowels, and other small components. Knowledge of these objects comes into play as each part has a specific purpose and is designed to fit with specific other parts. 2. Understand the properties of the components: It is important to comprehend the properties of the materials used in the furniture, such as wood, metal, and plastic. This helps to ensure that the furniture is sturdy, stable, and durable. For instance, wood can expand and contract with fluctuations in temperature and humidity, so sufficient space must be allowed to accommodate such changes. 3. Read and comprehend the instructions: Furniture assembly usually comes with a set of instructions explaining how the components should be arranged, fitted, and fastened together. Understanding these instructions is crucial for the successful completion of the task. The instructions often refer to the characteristics and purposes of the different physical objects involved. 4. Use appropriate tools: Knowledge of suitable tools, such as screwdrivers, hammers, and wrenches, is necessary to work with the physical objects. It's important to recognize the correct type and size of tools for the specific components involved in the assembly. 5. Properly manipulate and assemble the components: The assemblage of the furniture requires the appropriate manipulation and alignment of each component. For instance, knowledge of how to insert dowels into the pre-drilled holes, how to attach brackets to support shelves, and how to fasten screws or bolts while ensuring they are tight enough without stripping the threads is crucial. 6. Ensure stability and safety: Throughout the process, it's essential to understand the principles of stability and safety when dealing with physical objects. For example, using the proper method to attach a wall-mounting bracket to a bookshelf can prevent it from tipping over. 7. Evaluate the final product: Once the piece of furniture is assembled, an evaluation of the final product ensures that the assembly has been done correctly and all components are securely fastened together, providing a safe and functional piece of furniture. In conclusion, assembling a piece of furniture is an excellent example of a task that requires knowledge of physical objects to perform successfully. This process demands an understanding of the characteristics of various materials, how to appropriately manipulate and fasten components, and the use of suitable tools to create a durable, stable, and functional piece of furniture."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in English.","output":"Step 1: Determine the subject of the sentence.

The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.The borough was not one of those reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population – the first such board in Trafford.The local board was reconstituted as an urban district council in the administrative county of Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1894. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey Civil Parishes were added.

Having saw it twice, I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other. So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesn't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. But, I didn't rate it as a \\"great film\\", it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before. I saw the elements more clearly: Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I've seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters's own Slackers included. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. I don't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I've seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again. I'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.

Kitchen Creek flows through the park's three glens, which the descriptions of the waterfalls are organized by: Ricketts Glen, Glen Leigh, and Ganoga Glen. The falls are listed in order going upstream along Kitchen Creek, starting with the southernmost and ending at the northernmost in each glen. This is also the order in which a hiker would encounter the falls while traveling north along the creek on the Falls Trail.The Falls Trail is a 7.1-mile (11.4 km) loop hike. Starting at PA 118, it is 1.8 miles (2.9 km) north along the creek through Ricketts Glen to Waters Meet, where the trail divides. Following the Glen Leigh branch, it is 1.2 miles (1.9 km) north through the glen to the Highland Trail, then 1.0 mile (1.6 km) west along the Highland Trail to Ganoga Glen. Turning southeast, it is 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through Ganoga Glen back to Waters Meet, then the 1.8 miles (2.9 km) through Ricketts Glen is retraced, but heading south back to PA 118.The description of each waterfall starts with the name. While the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) Bureau of State Parks names 22 waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park (all but Kitchen Creek and Shingle Cabin), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) names 23 (all but Shingle Cabin), and Scott E. Brown's 2004 book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers names 24. There are also several unnamed waterfalls in the park, with the total number of falls given as 33 or 34. For each waterfall the height is given next, followed by the elevation above sea level, and the latitude and longitude. Each waterfall in the table is classified according to the four types used in Brown's book (falls, cascade, slide, and chute), with some classified as combinations of types. For each waterfall there are notes, which can give more information on the waterfall, the etymology of the name, and the location on the Falls Trail, followed by a photograph.

John is a physicist. He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C. But I can use this background: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \\"feel.\\" Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \\"pits\\".

You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Background Paragraph: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements. The main model for the radial structure of the interior of the Earth is the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM). Some parts of this model have been updated by recent findings in mineral physics (see post-perovskite) and supplemented by seismic tomography. The mantle is mainly composed of silicates, and the boundaries between layers of the mantle are consistent with phase transitions.The mantle acts as a solid for seismic waves, but under high pressures and temperatures it deforms so that over millions of years it acts like a liquid. This makes plate tectonics possible. Story: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Question: Would item A have higher or lower specific gravity than item B?","output":"higher"},{"instruction":"Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the last names of the two agents who offer Drew a deal?, using the article: When the infamous hacker Drew Reynolds is captured by the CIA, he is faced with a choice.

The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger.

During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.

Hadn't been to a Macaroni Grill in a few years, and was actually looking forward to it as my past experiences (although never at this location) were very good. When we were seated they tried to put us in the first table just outside of the main path back to the kitchen, even though the place was practically empty (it was a Tues evening). When we asked to move out of the main traffic area, they offered a table one spot away from the original one. OK, we'll play your silly game, let's not address the 800 lb gorilla in the room (the 85% empty restaurant). Once seated our server stopped by very quickly to get drink orders and apps. Before the app came out, our server was back to take our dinner order (so far, so good, right? Ahhhh, just wait). We ordered: Lasagna w/side salad, Capellini with meat sauce, Eggplant Parmesan with a side of sausage, and a Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad. The side salad came out not long after the app, and then the wait began. Not sure how long, but it was long enough for the entire table to get antsy and for us to ask for more bread. We even joked that it was because someone ordered lasagna. When the main courses came out, take a guess which one didn't come out with them...you ready? The Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad. Seriously. The rest of the table started eating (it can't be that far behind, right?) and no kidding, they were at least halfway through their main course when they brought out a salad with what looked like a half of a chicken tender chopped up in it. I thought maybe they had tossed it in or something, and when I confirmed the few small pieces were all that was there, it went from not so good to bad (and soon to really bad...wait for it...). So, here I sat with this sad salad with a couple pieces of chicken, and because the wait had been so long, I was done. I told the server I didn't want it anymore and to send it back. Then I told her to make sure her manager saw what was coming out of the kitchen. I saw her talk to the manager and she came back and said they were going to make some more chicken. I told her that I didn't want it at all. I saw her go talk to the manager, who was at this point standing in front of the girl making salads) and I know by her body language and his that she told him I didn't want it at all. A few minutes later I saw them put more chicken on the salad, put some more dressing on it, and he started walking over. When he got to the table I was PISSED (yeah, really). I asked him what part of \\"I don't want it\\" did he not understand and he just stood there hovering over me with this damn salad in his hands. I explained everything that had happened and he told me that the server never told him that I didn't want it at all. He asked if there was anything he could do and I said \\"Yes, you can go away\\" (he was still just standing there staring at me like he could use the Force to make me take the salad. Now, you might be thinking, \\"Damn, little harsh Bro!\\" Ah yeah, but wait til you hear what sent me over the top... When our server came back (who was very nice and apologetic this entire time) I asked her if she told him that I didn't want the salad at all, no matter how much chicken they put on it, she said (and I fully believe her) \\"Yes, I told him that\\". So I told her how he lied to me and threw her under the bus. THAT is just inexcusable. Forget to put an order in, fine. Something not cooked right, oopps. Throw one of your workers under the bus? Piss poor. Oh yeah, and the app we ordered was zucchini hold the cheese, and it came with cheese, and the side of sausage never came out. Would I ever go there again? Not a chance. At this point I don't know when I'll even risk going to another Macaroni Grill. Is this review positive or negative? A). negative B). positive Answer:","output":"A). negative This review is negative because the person had a bad experience at the Macaroni Grill with the service they received, problems with their order, and the manager's behavior.

Answer:","output":"As you gain momentum and find yourself ready to execute the hardflip, it's important to ensure that your back foot is properly positioned on the skateboard. Your back foot is essential to the success of this trick, so make sure to place it close to the middle of the deck, right at the center of the board, with your toes and arms ready to guide the flip. To achieve the perfect back foot position, first ensure that the ball of your foot is placed closely to the board's midpoint, mimicking the position you adopt when performing a kickflip. Be mindful to stay slightly raised on the ball of your foot, as this will enable better control and precision during the hardflip. When executing this trick, be aware of your surroundings, especially other people who may be nearby. As you move backward during the hardflip, you'll likely find it challenging to maintain control over your skateboard, making it crucial to avoid any collisions or accidents. Once you've considered your surroundings and are comfortable with your back foot positioning, it's time to focus on your momentum. It is essential that you lean forward as much as possible while maintaining balance and control. Transfer your body weight in such a way that it takes up the majority of the force generated during the flip. This will help you maintain stability and execute a smooth and successful hardflip.

Movie title: Carnal Knowledge Context: The story follows the sexual exploits of two Amherst College roommates over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, Jonathan objectifies women. He frequently uses the term \\"ballbuster\\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure as he sees it is to deny pleasure to men. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman. The film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged. In the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes. Sandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unknown to Sandy, she meets Jonathan, feeling a physical attraction for him. They have sex. Jonathan convinces Susan not to have sex with Sandy. Susan therefore has a purely intellectual relationship with Sandy, while at the same having a purely physical relationship with Jonathan.

How can I warm butter quickly?","output":"Warming butter quickly and efficiently without melting it requires following a number of steps. Here are several methods you can choose from: 1. **Cutting Room Temperature Method:** - Step 1: Remove the butter from the refrigerator and cut them into small pieces. The pieces should be uniform for them to heat evenly. - Step 2: Spread the pieces evenly on a plate to increase the surface area exposed to room temperature. This allows for quick and even warming. - Step 3: Let the butter sit for a few minutes until it attains the desired warmth. Depending on your room's temperature, this may take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. 2. **Grating Method:** - Step 1: Using a cheese grater, grate the butter while it is still hard from the fridge. The resulting small flakes of butter will melt faster due to the increased surface area exposed to the warmer room temperature. - Step 2: Gather the grated butter and let it come to room temperature, which should take lesser time than a whole block of butter. 3. **Microwave Method:** - Step 1: Cut the butter into small pieces to enable them to melt evenly, and put them in a microwave-safe container. - Step 2: Set the microwave power to 10-20% as your butter need to heat slowly to prevent it from melting or exploding due to the contained moisture turning into steam. - Step 3: Heat the butter in 10-second increments, stirring after each stint. Carry on heating, stirring at 10-second intervals until the butter is gently warmed. 4. **Heat Transfer Method from Lukewarm Water:** - Step 1: Keep the butter in a sealed plastic bag. This is to ensure that no water seeps in and alters the consistency of your butter. - Step 2: Fill a bowl with lukewarm water. Ensure that the water is not too hot, or you could end up melting the butter. - Step 3: Put the sealed bag containing butter in the water-filled bowl. The warm water will gradually heat your butter. Ensure you check the softness of the butter regularly to prevent it from melting. Remember that you should only warm the amount of butter you'll be using. Warmed butter will not last very long and should be used within a day or so. Also, each of these methods requires attention from you. Butter can melt or spoil very quickly when heated, so never leave your butter unattended during this process."},{"instruction":"Only one of the 35 negotiating chapters -- that on science and research -- has been provisionally closed.

Options: - table - staircase - office - shoes and socks - desk Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"1. Table: Tables are generally used for eating meals, working, or placing items on. Most people would consider putting feet on a table unhygienic and disrespectful as it could contaminate surfaces and food. This option is a strong contender for the most disgusting place to put feet. 2. Staircase: Staircases are specifically designed for walking, so it's expected that feet will come into contact with them. While some people may find dirty footprints on a staircase unappealing, putting feet on a staircase is generally not considered disgusting. 3. Office: Offices are spaces for work and collaboration. It would depend on the specific context, like putting feet on someone else's desk or on shared furniture, which could be considered rude and unhygienic. However, the office itself is not the most disgusting place to put feet compared to other options. 4. Shoes and socks: Feet naturally go into shoes and socks as they are designed for that purpose. While some people might find sweaty feet in shoes or socks a bit gross, it's generally not considered disgusting. 5. Desk: Desks are usually used for work, writing, or computing purposes. Placing feet on a desk can be seen as disrespectful, unhygienic, and unprofessional, especially in a shared or public space. This option is another strong contender for the most disgusting place to put feet. Step-by-step reasoning leads us to the conclusion that most people would find putting feet on a table or a desk to be the most disgusting option among the choices provided. Both involve surfaces that others may touch, work on, or eat from, and placing one's feet there can be seen as both unhygienic and disrespectful."},{"instruction":"Do these mean the same?

A:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: A: Invasion and colonization of bacteria in the human body A more detailed explanation of the entire process would be: 1. Invasion and colonization of bacteria in the human body: The process starts when harmful bacteria enter and colonize a specific area within the body, such as the digestive, respiratory, or urinary system. This can occur through various means, including open wounds, consumption of contaminated food or water, or inhalation of infected respiratory droplets. 2. Bacteria start to divide and grow: Once the bacteria have successfully invaded and colonized within the host, they rapidly multiply by undergoing cell division to increase their population. This allows the bacteria to form colonies and establish a stronghold in the area they have invaded. 3. The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells: The bacterial growth uses up nutrients, oxygen, and other resources that are essential for the normal function of the host cells. This deprives the surrounding healthy cells of the necessary resources they require to function optimally. 4. Other cells cannot function properly: Deprived of essential resources, the normal cells in the body start to function abnormally or die, leading to disruptions in the affected tissues and organs. 5. We feel unwell: The abnormal function of the host cells and organs, in conjunction with the ongoing invasion and colonization of the bacteria, manifest as symptoms that cause us to feel unwell, such as fever, fatigue, pain, or inflammation. 6. The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins: Many bacteria release harmful toxins as they grow and divide. These toxins can cause direct damage to cells and tissues, as well as trigger a series of negative reactions in the body. 7. Toxins harm the body: The presence of bacterial toxins can cause direct harm to the body's tissues and organs, including disruption of cell function, destruction of cells, and inflammation. 8. The body tries to react to the toxins: The immune system detects the presence of bacterial toxins and mounts a defense against the invading pathogens. This reaction includes the activation of various immune cells and the release of chemicals meant to contain and destroy the bacterial invaders. 9. The body's natural defenses can sometimes cause us to feel unwell: The immune response that seeks to protect the body from bacterial invasion can also contribute to the overall feeling of being unwell, as the immune system's efforts can lead to inflammation, fever, and other discomforts as it tries to neutralize and remove the harmful bacteria and their toxins."},{"instruction":"Question: I can use this background: The quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east Pacific Ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.Marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles.

The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway.

Usually, these are the same. But after a divorce, things can get different. For example, you may agree that one party will continue paying the loan and insurance, while the other party will get full ownership of the car. Make the changes to the title to fit your agreement. In most cases, a transfer is treated as a sale, and the state is likely to charge a sales tax when the title is changed. However, in the event of a divorce, some states may waive this tax if you present a divorce order along with the application for the new title. You will have to check with the registry in your state to see what applies to you. Suppose the original title had two individuals’ names on it, say a parent and child. At some point, the parent chooses to give the car completely to the child as a gift. This will require having the parent remove his or her name from the title as described in this article. Complete the form as a transfer, with the sale price as 0. This may avoid a sales tax or use tax. Many people choose to donate vehicles, particularly older ones, to charities. This will allow them to take the value of the car as a tax deduction, as long as the organization is a recognized 501(c)(3) charity. If you are doing this, complete the title the same as any other transfer, but put the name of the charity or it authorized representative as the “buyer,” with a sale price of 0. You will then give the completed paperwork to the charity. The charity will be responsible for completing the work with the DMV in order to transfer ownership. In case one owner on the title of a car passes away, the remaining owner will need to consider whether additional papers are needed, or even if any additional steps are necessary. If the title was in both spouse’s names, the surviving spouse can generally submit the original title with a copy of the death certificate. If the vehicle was left to someone in a will, then the executor of the estate will need to submit an affidavit or certificate along with the title. In any event, it will probably be advisable to get a probate attorney involved to make sure that the transfer is completed properly.","output":"During a divorce, decisions need to be made regarding car ownership, payment responsibilities, and title changes. It may be possible to avoid sales tax on these transfers in certain situations, such as in a divorce or when gifting a car. Donations to a recognized 501(c)(3) charity can provide tax deductions. When a car owner passes away, surviving owners or estate executors must follow specific procedures, possibly involving a probate attorney, to ensure proper title transfers."},{"instruction":"protesters stormed the presidential compound in kyrgyzstan on thursday , entering the building after clashing with riot police who were surrounded it during a large opposition rally .

Stream of thoughts:","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as it accurately captures the main elements of the provided scene. To break this down, let's analyze the premise and hypothesis statements: Premise: \\"A man sits outside at a wooden table and reads a book while ducks eat in the foreground.\\" This premise describes a scene in which: 1. There is a man sitting outside. 2. The man is seated at a wooden table. 3. He reads a book. 4. In the foreground of the scene, ducks are eating. Hypothesis: \\"The man at the table is reading a book while ducks are in sight.\\" The hypothesis contains the same key components: 1. There is a man at the table (which is outside, based on the premise—though not mentioned). 2. The man is reading a book. 3. Ducks are in sight—this aligns with the ducks eating in the foreground in the premise, implying they are visible within the scene. Both the premise and hypothesis describe a man reading a book in an outdoor setting where ducks are present and visible. The hypothesis essentially rephrases the premise by focusing on the visual aspect (\\"ducks are in sight\\") instead of specifying that they are eating in the foreground. Despite this slight difference in phrasing, they convey similar scenes with the same main elements. Therefore, we can conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"Bloomberg haber ajansının aktardığına göre Cankov, Perşembe günü verdiği bir röportajda \\"Belene projesinin %80 durdurulma ihtimali var,\\" dedi.

First, since it is past 2019 and epilepsy has not been cured, the statement is outdated and incorrect. While advances are being made in the treatment and understanding of epilepsy, a complete cure for the condition has not yet been discovered. Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder affecting millions of people worldwide, characterized by recurrent seizures. These seizures result from excessive electrical activity in the brain. The causes of epilepsy vary and may include genetic factors, brain injury, infection, or tumors. In recent years, different treatments have been developed to help manage epilepsy, such as antiepileptic medications, surgical interventions, and implantable devices like vagus nerve stimulators. Furthermore, research is ongoing to better understand the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy and to develop new treatment options. Although significant progress has been made, a universal and definitive cure remains elusive. Therapy outcomes vary depending on the type of epilepsy, severity of the condition, and the specific cause. Some patients may achieve seizure-free status with medication or surgery, while others continue to struggle despite multiple interventions. In summary, the statement that epilepsy could be cured by 2019 is not accurate or verifiable. While progress is being made in epilepsy research and treatment development, a conclusive cure has yet to be found or universally applied."},{"instruction":"However , mice survived with a non-working copy of the single TWIST - Gens .

Overworking your eyes may lead to symptoms such as dryness, redness, blurred vision, headaches, and sensitivity to light. Here is a detailed guide on the best ways to rest your eyes: 1. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Spend 20 seconds looking at something 20 feet away, every 20 minutes. This helps relax the focusing muscles inside the eyes and gives them a break from the strain caused by staring at near objects for a long time. 2. Adjust your screen brightness: Ensure that your computer screen or other digital device's brightness is adjusted to a comfortable level. Position your screen at an arm's length away and slightly below eye level to help maintain a natural posture and reduce eye strain. 3. Blink frequently: Blinking helps to moisten the eyes, preventing dryness and irritation. Make an effort to blink every few seconds while working on a computer or using other digital devices to provide your eyes with necessary lubrication. 4. Use the correct lighting: Ensure that your workspace has adequate lighting that doesn't cause glare on your screen. Consider using a desk lamp that illuminates only your work area without shining directly on the screen. Curtains or blinds can help control the amount of natural light that enters your room, and an anti-glare screen can also be helpful in reducing glare. 5. Take regular breaks: Incorporate short breaks into your daily routine to rest your eyes and avoid eye strain. Walk away from the computer every hour or so, and give your eyes a 5-10 minute break, focusing on distant objects during this time. 6. Perform eye exercises: Simple eye exercises can help to reduce eye strain and relax your eye muscles. Try moving your eyes in a figure-eight pattern. Focus on an object at a distance and hold your gaze for a few seconds, then return to concentrating on a close object. Repeat this process several times. 7. Adjust text size and contrast: Increase the text size and contrast on digital devices to make it easier to read. This helps lessen eye strain and reduces the need to squint or strain while reading. 8. Use proper eyewear: If you are experiencing eye strain and discomfort, consult an optometrist to check your prescription for glasses or contact lenses. Wearing the correct prescription can significantly reduce eye strain and fatigue. 9. Apply the palming technique: Gently cup your hands over your eyes, with the fingers overlapping on your forehead and the heels of your hands resting on your cheekbones. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Do this for about 1-2 minutes to provide instant relief and relaxation for your eyes. 10. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, getting adequate sleep, and engaging in physical activity can help promote eye health and overall well-being. Remember that incorporating these habits into your daily routine will help prevent eye strain and preserve your vision. If you continue to experience ongoing discomfort or unusual symptoms, consult an optometrist or healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance."},{"instruction":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: so it's that dry heat Sentence 2: It's arid. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Options are: (1). yes (2). it is not possible to tell (3). no","output":"The answer is (1). Yes. To explain, the term 'dry heat' in sentence 1 is suggestive of a specific type of climate or environmental condition, which is characterized by low humidity and lack of moisture in the air, and probably high temperatures. In this context, it directly aligns with the definition of the term 'arid' used in Sentence 2. 'Arid', according to its dictionary definition, means being extremely dry, having barely any rainfall, especially such that it leads to harsh or uninhabitable conditions. This could be typically found in desert-like climates. When describing air conditions, 'arid' refers to an environment where there's notably a lack of moisture or humidity, which fits the description of 'dry heat'. In conclusion, if Sentence 1 stating 'so it's that dry heat' is true, it implies that the environment is experiencing a condition with low humidity and a lack of moisture, which is notably warm or hot. Then, Sentence 2 stating 'It's arid' is also true because 'arid' describes a similar condition – that is, extreme dryness, lack of moisture or humidity usually associated with high temperatures.

How much money did Jane earn?","output":"Step 1: Determine the number of each type of flower bulb Jane planted. - Tulip bulbs: 20 bulbs - Iris bulbs: Half the amount of tulip bulbs, so 20 / 2 = 10 bulbs - Daffodil bulbs: 30 bulbs - Crocus bulbs: Three times the amount of daffodil bulbs, so 3 * 30 = 90 bulbs Step 2: Calculate the total number of flower bulbs Jane planted. - Total bulbs = Tulip bulbs + Iris bulbs + Daffodil bulbs + Crocus bulbs - Total bulbs = 20 + 10 + 30 + 90 = 150 bulbs Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Jane earned. - Jane's mother paid her .50 for every bulb she planted. - Money earned = Total bulbs * Money per bulb - Money earned = 150 bulbs * 0.50 - Money earned = 75.00 So, Jane earned 75.00 after planting all the flower bulbs."},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence. The shrimp didn't cook well on the grill, while the steak was perfect, since the","output":"shrimp required a more delicate and precise cooking method, whereas the steak's thickness and composition allowed for even heat distribution and proper caramelization, ultimately resulting in a more satisfying culinary experience. When grilling shrimp, there are several factors that can influence the cooking process and the final result. Firstly, the size of the shrimp plays a crucial role, as smaller shrimp tend to cook much faster than larger ones. Therefore, it's essential to choose the appropriate grilling technique based on their size. Secondly, shrimp are highly sensitive to heat and overcooking can lead to a rubbery, unappetizing texture. The ideal heat level for grilling shrimp should be medium-high, enabling it to cook through evenly while maintaining a tender and succulent interior. To ensure that the shrimp doesn't cook too quickly or unevenly, it's important to keep a close eye on them and turn them frequently for even exposure to heat. On the other hand, the steak's successful grilling can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the thickness of the steak allows for even heat distribution, which ensures that the steak is thoroughly cooked on the inside while developing a desirable sear on the outside. Moreover, the steak's composition, including its marbling and fat content, play a substantial role in creating a perfectly cooked steak. This is because the fat renders during the cooking process, which contributes to a juicy and flavorful steak. Additionally, the steak's outer surface contains proteins and sugars that undergo the Maillard reaction when exposed to high heat. This reaction creates a series of complex, caramelized and savory flavor compounds that greatly enhance the taste of the steak. In contrast, the relatively low protein and sugar content in shrimp prevents the Maillard reaction from occurring to a significant extent, thus limiting the development of analogous flavors. Another important factor to consider while grilling steak is the appropriate level of doneness desired, with rare, medium, and well-done being the three primary stages. Each stage corresponds to a specific internal temperature of the steak, which can be monitored using a meat thermometer. By attaining the desired internal temperature, one can ensure that the steak is cooked to perfection in terms of taste, texture, and appearance. In conclusion, the shrimp didn't cook well on the grill, while the steak was perfect because allowing for a comparison between their distinct characteristics and grilling requirements. Shrimp require a more delicate and precise cooking method, while steak's thickness, composition, and overall suitability to high heat result in a delicious and satisfying meal. To achieve optimal results, it's essential to understand the unique properties of each ingredient and modify the cooking techniques accordingly."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Angela: Heyaaa Brian: Hey Angela: I have a question, for you as an admin Brian: yeah?

Choices: - galaxy - atom - molecular system - solar system A: Answer:","output":"A solar system A solar system is the term used to describe a system that has one or more planets orbiting one or more stars. This type of system is composed of various celestial bodies, including the stars at its center, planets, moons, asteroids, and other smaller bodies such as comets and meteoroids. Each celestial body within a solar system is held together by gravitational forces, causing them to follow a specific path or trajectory in their orbits. A solar system is distinct from the other choices provided: 1. Galaxy: A galaxy is a large system of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. Although a galaxy can contain multiple solar systems, it is much larger in scale and complexity. For example, our own Milky Way galaxy contains billions of stars, and many of them have their own solar systems with planets orbiting around them. 2. Atom: An atom is the smallest unit of a chemical element that retains the chemical properties of that element. It consists of a nucleus, containing a certain number of protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons. Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter and take part in chemical reactions. They are significantly smaller in size than a solar system and operate on a completely different scale – the atomic scale. 3. Molecular system: A molecular system consists of two or more atoms bonded together to form a single, stable unit called a molecule. Molecules are larger than atoms but still much smaller than solar systems. They are formed through chemical reactions, whereas solar systems are formed through astrophysical processes such as the gravitational collapse of giant molecular clouds. In summary, a solar system is the most appropriate term to describe a system involving one or more planets orbiting one or more stars. It consists of various celestial bodies that interact through gravitational forces, and it operates on an astronomical scale, significantly larger than the atomic and molecular scales of atoms and molecules."},{"instruction":"Information: - The PlayStation 2 (abbreviated as PS2) is a home video game console that was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

As the bread continues to absorb water and warmth from the air, the mold spores that have fallen on it are provided with an optimal environment to germinate and grow. As the mold starts to consume the bread for energy, it begins to secrete enzymes and other digestive compounds that break down the complex organic compounds in the bread, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, into simpler compounds that the mold can easily absorb. This decomposition process results in physical changes to the bread, including changes in color, texture, and smell. The once soft, fresh bread becomes discolored, often covered with fuzzy mold growths, and takes on a musty or sour odor. At the same time, the mold colony expands and produces more spores, which are then released into the air and can potentially land on other food items or surfaces, starting the process over again. The consumption and decomposition of the bread by the mold serve as a means of recycling nutrients and organic matter in the environment, as the breakdown of complex organic compounds into simpler forms releases essential nutrients for other organisms to utilize. During this process, some mold species may also produce secondary metabolites, such as toxic compounds called mycotoxins, as a defense mechanism against other microbes or as a way to prevent the consumption of the contaminated food by animals. In conclusion, the final step of the process where bread is exposed to the elements, absorbs water and warmth, and becomes a substrate for mold growth, is the decomposition and breakdown of the bread by the mold, which results in the release of nutrients, the formation of new mold colonies, and the potential production of mycotoxins. This process highlights the importance of proper food storage and hygiene practices in preventing mold growth and food spoilage."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who were suspected of committing the murders in the Avenue Range Station massacre? from the following article ? The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi.... The answer is:","output":"James Brown and his overseer, Eastwood, were the two people suspected of committing the murders in the Avenue Range Station massacre. They were believed to have carried out the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. However, the case did not go to trial due to legal hurdles, key witnesses fleeing or refusing to cooperate, and settler solidarity."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Problem:What do you want? Solution:","output":"To complete this task, you need to translate the English sentence \\"What do you want?\\" into the Yoruba language. Here are the steps to accomplish this: 1. Identify the words in the English sentence: In the sentence \\"What do you want?\\", there are four words - \\"What\\", \\"do\\", \\"you\\", and \\"want\\". 2. Understand the meaning of each word: - \\"What\\" is used to ask for information specifying something - \\"do\\" is an auxiliary verb that acts as a helping verb in questions - \\"you\\" is the pronoun referring to the person being asked - \\"want\\" refers to the desire for something 3. Translate the words in the Yoruba language: - \\"What\\" can be translated to \\"Kini\\" in Yoruba - \\"do\\" is not specifically translated in Yoruba as the structure of questions is different - \\"you\\" can be translated to \\"ọ\\" (informal) or \\"ẹ\\" (formal) in Yoruba - \\"want\\" can be translated to \\"fe\\" in Yoruba 4. Construct the sentence in the Yoruba language by re-arranging the words according to Yoruba syntax: In Yoruba language, the sentence structure usually follows Subject-Verb-Object order. But in interrogative sentences, the question word comes first. So, the structure would be: Kini (What) + ọ/ẹ (you) + fe (want)? 5. Based on the above structure, the Yoruba translation of \\"What do you want?\\" would be: \\"Kini ọ fe?\\" (informal) or \\"Kini ẹ fe?\\" (formal) In conclusion, the task was to translate the English sentence \\"What do you want?\\" into Yoruba. Using the given guidelines, the translation is \\"Kini ọ fe?\\" (informal) or \\"Kini ẹ fe?\\" (formal)."},{"instruction":"\\"grown-up voice \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived -- Choose your answer from: a). negative b). positive Answer:","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"grown-up voice,\\" can be perceived as neither entirely positive nor negative because it solely depends upon the context in which it is used. It is essential to have more information or context surrounding the phrase to make a proper evaluation of its sentiment. For instance, if the phrase is used in a conversation where someone is trying to sound more mature, responsible, and assertive, it could be perceived as positive. This might indicate that the person is taking a situation seriously, or that they are showing signs of growth. Conversely, if the \\"grown-up voice\\" is being used mockingly or sarcastically, it could be seen as negative. In this scenario, the phrase might suggest a sense of condescension, or that the speaker is belittling the person to whom they are speaking. It is worth noting that phrases and statements can have different meanings and emotional connotations based on the context, tone of voice, and the relationship between the speaker and listener. In conclusion, without specific contextual information or an example of the phrase being used in a sentence, it is impossible to definitively label the sentiment as either positive or negative."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-select question: Do the following sentences say the same thing?

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How does Pres Trump feel about the tariffs? Options: - that they should be tougher - not enough information - that they are warranted - that they should be revised Answer:","output":"- that they are warranted"},{"instruction":"Niin sanotut bestseller-kirjat antavat kustantamoille suurten painosten ansiosta huomattavaa tuottoa alhaisemmista hinnoista huolimatta.

A. Main Office: The main office is a possible location for a master control, as it is where key management and decision-making processes occur. However, it might not be the most efficient location, since the master control should be in a secure and dedicated location to monitor and manage technical operations. B. Center: This term is vague but could imply a data center or a control center. In this case, a data center or control center would be a likely location for a master control, as these places are specifically designed to house, monitor, and manage technological infrastructure. C. Beach: A beach is an unlikely location for a master control due to environmental factors, lack of security, and practicality. D. Manufacturing Plant: A manufacturing plant is primarily focused on producing hardware and other products. While it might involve some control systems, a master control for a technology company would more likely be located where the core operations and computing infrastructure are housed. E. Basement: A basement could be a possible location for a master control, as it provides a secure, dedicated space that is separate from the main office areas. However, it might not be the most efficient location if the company operates across multiple buildings or locations. Based on our analysis, the best answer is B. Center, as it implies a dedicated location like a data center or control center that is specifically designed for managing a technology company's infrastructure and operations."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: This can be time before you will see your mother-in-law, or even during a family event. Take some time to be by yourself and reflect on how the relationship feels in the moment. At a difficult family gathering, you can excuse yourself for a short walk around the block, or to make a phone call to a trusted friend. Before you see your mother-in-law, spend some time by yourself. You can use this time to reflect and relax so that you’ll have an easier time when you do see your mother-in-law. You may need to vent to a friend after spending time with your mother-in-law. Have someone on hand whom you can call if you need to. This step can seem drastic, but if your mother-in-law is truly abusive, moving may be the only viable option. Many couples do move based on proximity to in-laws. Living farther away can prevent meddling and unwanted visits. If your mother-in-law’s abuse affects your children, moving away can help assure their safety from her. You can choose whether you and your spouse will be honest about the reason for moving or not. Sometimes, a spouse isn’t willing or able to admit that their mother is abusive. This can cause a rift between partners, and sometimes causes the relationship to end. If your spouse can’t admit that their mother is abusive, offer to see a couple’s therapist together before deciding to end the marriage. Leaving a marriage is a big decision that shouldn’t be taken lightly. However, you should never tolerate abuse in order to preserve a marriage. If your mother-in-law has caused trauma for you or your children, you may want to see a therapist even after your mother-in-law is out of your life. Abuse can take years to recover from, even when the abuser is no longer a threat. Even if your spouse doesn't see the abuse, you may still need to deal with its effects on you. Children can be affected by abuse even if they are not consciously aware of it. Make sure they have someone safe to talk to if they've been exposed to abusive behavior. Summary:","output":"To better manage a difficult relationship with an abusive mother-in-law, take time before and during family events to reflect and relax, and have a trusted friend to call for support. If necessary, consider moving farther away to prevent meddling and ensure the safety of your children. If your spouse doesn't acknowledge the abuse, suggest couple's therapy before making drastic decisions like ending the marriage. Seek therapy for yourself and your children, as the effects of abuse can take years to recover from, even once the abuser is no longer present in your life."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","output":"Sure!

In a shocking turn of events, the Yankees quite literally \\"dropped the ball,\\" further destabilising their winning chances on the field. In the early innings, the Yankees displayed tenacity and focus, a promising start that had fans on the edge of their seats. They held fast to their strategic gameplay, focused on securing a much-needed victory. Yankees players knew the value of building up momentum in a high-stakes game. As the innings progressed, a sudden dip in confidence and teamwork further complicated matters. With the fervent support from the crowd, the Yankees tried to preserve their unsullied reputation and past victories by maintaining the upper hand. However, misfortune struck when a seemingly simple catch was botched in a pivotal moment. This costly mistake was both unexpected and consequential, disrupting the team's harmony and causing a drop in morale. The tension was palpable as they struggled to recover their composure, grappling with the disbelief and disappointment now casting its shadow on the field. The opposition seized this opportunity, capitalizing on the Yankees' fumble and harnessing the newfound energy. As the game continued, the Yankees struggled to regain the momentum they once had, grappling with the knowledge that their performance had faltered. The fans, too, were heartbroken by the team's inability to recover from this mishap. The support continued to pour in, but the earlier enthusiasm had been dampened, as all attempts to ignite the Yankees' fading momentum were met with challenges. Ultimately, the Yankees were unable to regain their footing, burdened by the weight of the dropped ball. A sense of defeat lingered in the air as they walked off the field, reflecting on the game and the hard-earned lessons they would carry into their future confrontations. In the world of sports, a single moment has the potential to change the course of a game – in this case, the Yankees' ball drop shook their momentum, but it also served as a humbling reminder of the highs and lows of competition. The team's fortitude and determination will be tested in the upcoming games, and only time will tell if they can bounce back from this disheartening loss."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following passage \\"The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962.

While the statement \\"Boys having some great moments with a missionary in the city of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.\\" does provide some information, it does not provide enough details to accurately conclude that \\"Boys are laughing with a missionary with a Kinshasa sign in the background.\\" The original statement only mentions that the boys are having great moments with a missionary in the city of Kinshasa. This could mean various things, such as sharing stories, playing games, or learning together. There is no specific mention of laughter or a Kinshasa sign in the background.

As it stands, we cannot make that conclusion based on the information provided. Additionally, it's essential to consider the phrasing of the second statement. While the first statement is relatively vague and open to interpretation, the second statement makes specific assumptions, such as the presence of laughter and the Kinshasa sign.

One (which also applied to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator cost about 3 million. If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force, but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it; the CIA disagreed. Second, Tenet in particular questioned whether he, as Director of Central Intelligence, should operate an armed Predator.\\" This was new ground,\\"he told us. Tenet ticked off key questions: What is the chain of command? Who takes the shot? Are America's leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this, going outside of normal military command and control? Charlie Allen told us that when these questions were discussed at the CIA, he and the Agency's executive director, A. B.\\" Buzzy\\" Krongard, had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger, but Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he. Third, the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work. It had been built to hit tanks, not people. It needed to be designed to explode in a different way, and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision. In the configuration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001, the Predator's missile would not be able to hit a moving vehicle. White House officials had seen the Predator video of the \\"man in white.\\" On July 11, Hadley tried to hurry along preparation of the armed system. He directed McLaughlin, Wolfowitz, and Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Richard Myers to deploy Predators capable of being armed no later than September 1. Question: \\"Why was Tenet appalled?\\" Response: \\"Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. It merely restates the fact that Tenet was appalled but does not explain why. Allow me to provide a more detailed answer. George Tenet, then-Director of Central Intelligence, was appalled at the idea of using armed Predators for several reasons. The operation of an armed drone by the CIA raised numerous concerns, which Tenet questioned: 1. Chain of command issues: The proposal to use armed Predators raised questions about the chain of command. Traditionally, such operations were carried out by the military, not the CIA. Tenet was unsure who would be responsible for making decisions and ultimately taking the shot. 2. Role of the CIA: Tenet questioned whether the CIA should be involved in operating armed drones, as this was a departure from its usual intelligence-gathering activities. Venturing into direct military operations had potential geopolitical and legal implications that were not fully understood. 3. Technical challenges: The Hellfire missile carried by the Predator was designed to target tanks, not individuals, so adapting it for counterterrorism operations required significant modifications. Additionally, in the existing configuration, the missile would not be capable of hitting moving targets, reducing its effectiveness in certain situations. In summary, George Tenet was appalled at the prospect of the CIA operating armed Predators due to concerns about the chain of command, the CIA's role in such operations, and technical challenges of using the Predator for counterterrorism missions."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.ringdroid.

Premise: Is 25 million more going to be enough in a state like Wisconsin? Hypothesis: 25 million is plenty of money for a state such as Wisconsin. Analyzing the premise, we get an inquiry about whether 25 million would suffice for a state like Wisconsin. It doesn't contain any explicit or implicit affirmation about the sufficiency of the amount, it's merely a question. Looking at the hypothesis, it assumes an affirmative answer to the premise question, saying that 25 million is a substantial amount for Wisconsin. Now, the hypothesis under consideration isn't necessarily deduced from the premise since the premise doesn't provide any affirmation or support to the assertion made. The premise is neutral—posing a question, while the hypothesis jumps to a conclusion—that 25 million is sufficient.

( http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/ ) Those who have will pick the similarities straightaway....I've heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd \\"boys talking crap\\", but it comes across as forced... I believe Oscar Keightley sees himself as deeply ironic, but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious. Those who have any doubts left at all that Samoans-living-in-NZ culture has been deeply , hopefully not permanently ,affected by American speech , culture, and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie. Robbie magasiva always looks good on screen , but is let down by the script.. It always rubs me up the wrong way when a \\"comedy\\" has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way, you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline - see the wanna be white boy... I know someone who found this movie hilarious -however, that person has the brains of a tadpole, and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars.... That kinda sums up the mentality of this flick , OK but not great , fun but not funny.....Wake up NZ - this is NOT a 5 star movie despite all the glowing (middle class white guilt ?? :-) ) reviews....

The novel, published in 1831, delves into themes of love, redemption, and social injustice, all set against the backdrop of 15th-century Paris. From theatrical plays to musical adaptations, the story of the deformed bell-ringer Quasimodo and the beautiful gypsy, Esmeralda, has taken on various forms, enchanting audiences through differing perspectives. Here is an ordered list of reviews for the novel \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" (ISBN: 1073037). 1. Classic Literature Review: 5/5 Stars \\"Victor Hugo's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' is a timeless classic that explores themes just as relevant today as they were in the 19th-century. The author's description of Gothic architecture and the Cathedral of Notre Dame itself not only serves as the backdrop for the story but breathes life into the narrative, making it a character of its own. The depth of each character's backstory and their development are evidenced in Hugo's entrancing writing style, ultimately creating a captivating experience for the reader.\\" 2. Historical Fiction Enthusiast: 4.5/5 Stars \\"As a fan of historical fiction, 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' offers an exceptional glimpse into the societal norms and political climate of 15th-century Paris. Victor Hugo's detailed and picturesque descriptions of the city transport the reader back in time while connecting current themes with past events, underscoring the cyclical nature of human experience. My only critique is the occasional lengthy digression, which can disrupt the flow of the story.\\" 3. Broadway Buff: 3.5/5 Stars \\"Having seen and enjoyed the musical adaptation of 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' I was eager to read the source material. While I appreciated the vivid imagery and captivating narrative of the original, it is markedly darker than its theatrical counterpart, as some of the characters' motivations and relationships are significantly different. Though I found certain passages to be dense and slow-moving, it remains an essential read for those who are interested in the inspiration behind the stage adaptation.\\" 4. Romance Novelist: 4/5 Stars \\"As someone who appreciates a good love story, 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' does not disappoint. Hugo masterfully weaves a tale of forbidden love, passion, and sacrifice against the backdrop of socially-sanctioned prejudice. The complex relationships between the characters are what truly drive the plot, as their impossibly tangled destinies come together to form a tragic romance that has continued to enchant readers for centuries.\\" 5. Philosophical Bookworm: 5/5 Stars \\"Victor Hugo's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' is a literary feast for those who are drawn to deep, philosophical themes. The novel explores the human condition, the nature of beauty and deformity, and the corruptibility of power, all interwoven into an intricate narrative that challenges preconceived notions of morality. The allegorical elements of the story make it an essential selection for readers seeking a transformative experience.\\" In summary, \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" is a timeless literary classic that has appealed to generations of readers, from fans of historical fiction to theater enthusiasts. Its depth of character and poignant exploration of societal themes make it a must-read for anyone looking to immerse themselves in the world of 15th-century Paris, as told through Hugo's captivating prose."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Starting in Great Britain, Isabelle \\"Izzy\\" (Rebecca Rosso) and Annabelle \\"Annie\\" Woods (Camilla Rosso) are introduced as clever twin girls with a love for pink like their cousin, Elle Woods.

Most organizations, businesses, and groups in the modern era thrive because of their online presence. You can go the simple route of starting up a Facebook page for your club, or you can create a website. If you aren’t good with social media, enlist the help of one of your early joiners to create the online club page. This can have contact information for the club’s leader, meeting location and other details, the clubs purposes and mission statement, and other relevant information that someone searching for the club would want to know. As the club grows, this can become a vital resource for staying connected as a group. It can be a place to message members, post cool articles and videos, and alert your members to any upcoming events or changes to schedules. While an online presence is important, getting your name out there still requires more than just a website. You can post flyers around your college campus, high school, office, church, or anywhere else around town. Cards can be carried by the founding members to pass out to people. Business cards and flyers should have the name of your club, some contact info, and a brief blurb about the purpose of the club. Local mechanic shops would be a great place to leave some flyers and cards. Flyers are great because they are a constant presence that will ideally stay where you put them for quite a while. They’ll get more views than handing a business card to one person. You can go through parking lots and place these on cars that seem like they belong to people who would be interested in an enthusiasts club. Some of your meetings might focus on just reaching out to new people and handing out flyers and cards. Once your club has been established for a little while, perhaps a few months, you can hold meetings that are specifically designed to invite new people. This could be sort of like a mixer which has a welcoming environment to make potential members feel comfortable. If you feel that your club is at a good size, you may not want to continue expanding. It’s okay to find a size that works well and allow the group to hang out there for a while. If your club is based around a university, talk to the clubs or organizations office and get an official sanction. The benefit of this is that you can get university funding for your programs and events. Another option is to seek out accreditation from a national car club. You can become a charter club that is part of their official network. There are many benefits to belonging to a larger organization, and national car club chapters can usually advise the local chapters on management, event planning and marketing opportunities. Check out a registry like http://www.jctaylor.com/car-club-directory/ to browse national car clubs.","output":"This article discusses the importance of having an online presence for clubs and organizations, and provides tips on using social media, flyers, business cards, networking events, and affiliations with larger organizations to grow and maintain club membership."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Riley walked on the close side of the sidewalk next to the street next to her girlfriend.

He follows a man named Andrews to a hotel, then reports back to his clients, club owners Kirk and Gregory, where the man, their business partner, can be found. They pay Waring a 500 fee, whereupon Wilma Rogers, who works at the club and likes Andrews, expresses her displeasure with Waring for informing on him. She also tips off Andrews that his partners are coming. Kirk and Gregory return, angry not only that they can't find Andrews or the 100,000 he embezzled, but that a hotel clerk, Perry, was under the impression that Waring left Andrews' room carrying what appeared to be a lot of money.

Waring eventually is able to locate the missing money, which he gives to a police lieutenant, Cooper, for safekeeping. Then he exposes the real culprit behind Andrews' murder and the theft, Perry, the clerk., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The business partner of Kirk and Gregory, as mentioned in the article, is a man named Andrews. The article details that Andrews was being followed on a case by an individual named Mike Waring, a private detective based in Los Angeles known as \\"The Falcon\\". Andrews was located at a hotel by Waring who then relayed this information back to Kirk and Gregory, who are identified as the club owners. Andrews is not just another person involved in the business but is particularly significant due to the fact that he has supposedly embezzled 100,000 from Kirk and Gregory. This is a significant sum of money, which underscores the urgency for Kirk and Gregory to find him. Their frustration amplifies when they arrived at the hotel only to find that Andrews isn't there, but instead, they encounter a hotel clerk named Perry who appears to be implicating Waring in the alleged misappropriation of funds. This results in Waring suspecting that Kirk and Gregory, the club owners, may be attempting to set him up or frame him for the situation involving Andrews and the missing funds. The situation becomes more complicated when Waring starts to doubt the intentions of Elaine Carson, another character who offers to assist him in resolving the issue. The story concludes with Waring locating the missing money and handing it over to a police lieutenant named Cooper for safekeeping, and disclosing that the real perpetrator behind Andrews' murder and the theft was the hotel clerk, Perry.

It can be used in both negative and positive contexts, however, in a movie review, it's typically considered as something positive. It suggests a successful engagement and emotional investment that a viewer has towards the movie. However, we must bear in mind that without further context or a complete review, the assessment can slightly shift. For instance, if the full review described the film as depressing, frustrating, or anxiety-inducing, then \\"gets under your skin\\" might have a negative connotation. In this specific context given, it leans more towards a strength of the movie, hence it is perceived as a positive review.

However, not only does Lola suspect that he's ready for one more job, so does the local thug, Henri Mooré (Don Cheadle), who threatens Burdett to steal the diamond for him.Burdett pretends to work with Mooré, even giving him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he earlier related to Stan). Stan teams up with local police officer Sophie (Naomie Harris) to catch Burdett, and tails him to Junkanoo, a local parade, where Max loses him, warning that he shouldn't tail so closely.

The potato fell straight through. She then put down the toilet lid and conducted the experiment again, and the potato bounced harmlessly off the lid. That's because (A) the saran wrap is thinner (B) the toilet lid is thinner. What is the most sensical answer between \\"saran wrap\\" and \\"toilet lid\\"?","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"saran wrap\\" and \\"toilet lid\\" is (A) the saran wrap is thinner. Here's a detailed explanation of why: In the short story, Sue first wraps saran wrap over the bowl of her toilet and drops a potato in the middle of it. The potato falls straight through, which indicates that the saran wrap is not capable of supporting the weight of the potato. The most likely reason for this is due to the saran wrap's thinness and its relative lack of strength. Saran wrap is made from plastic and is designed to be thin and flexible, mainly for food preservation purposes. Its primary function is to create an airtight seal to protect the freshness of food, not to provide support against heavy objects like a potato. On the other hand, when Sue conducts the experiment again with the toilet lid down, the potato bounces harmlessly off the lid. Toilet lids are usually made from a much more robust material, such as plastic or wood, and are designed to be thicker and stronger than saran wrap. The primary function of a toilet lid is to cover the toilet bowl, providing support and acting as a barrier when not in use. Due to its thickness and the materials used, the toilet lid can withstand the force of the dropped potato, preventing it from falling through. Considering the properties and functions of both materials, it is far more logical to conclude that the reason the potato falls through when the saran wrap is used and not when the toilet lid is used is that the saran wrap is thinner and less robust. Hence, the most sensical answer is (A) the saran wrap is thinner."},{"instruction":"What's not to like about this movie?

The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: Why does an Asian girl have a different ethnicity than a white girl? Answer: An Asian girl has a different ethnicity than a white girl due to their distinct ancestral, cultural, and genetic backgrounds. Ethnicity refers to a group of people who share a common cultural heritage, language, history, and sometimes even physical traits. There are several factors that contribute to the differences in ethnicity between an Asian girl and a white girl: 1. Ancestry: The ancestral origins of an Asian girl typically lie in the numerous countries of Asia, such as China, Japan, Korea, India, the Philippines, and many others. On the other hand, a white girl's ancestry is usually traced back to European countries like the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and others. These distinct ancestral origins are primarily responsible for the divergence in their ethnicities. 2. Cultural practices: Culture is an integral aspect of ethnicity, encompassing the customs, traditions, languages, and social norms of a particular group. Asian and white girls often have different cultural practices due to their unique geographical locations, historical backgrounds, religious beliefs, and societal influences. For example, traditional clothing, local holidays, and preferred cuisine vary significantly between these two groups. 3. Genetic makeup: Genetics is another factor that plays a role in determining ethnicity. Asian and white individuals often possess distinct genetic traits, which affect their physical attributes. For instance, the melanin content in the skin is typically higher among Asians, resulting in a generally darker complexion compared to white individuals. Other genetic differences - such as variations in eye shape, hair structure, and the like - contribute to the diverse physical appearances of these ethnic groups. In conclusion, an Asian girl and a white girl have different ethnicities due to the combination of their ancestral history, cultural practices, and genetic makeup. These differences shape their identities and help create the rich tapestry of cultural diversity that exists in our world."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A man and a woman are sitting on a couch playing a video game.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man is sweeping his porch.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of Western culture, beginning with Hellenic (i.e. Greek) philosophy of the Pre-Socratics such as Thales (c. 624 c. 546 BC) and Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC), and eventually covering a large area of the globe.

Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the Heian period (7941185), Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (11851600) saw changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, as well as the first appearance of European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th centurymid-19th century).

The common idea that most kids from kindergarten through college have of a scientist is a man wearing a white lab coat with messy hair, big glasses, and several glass cups of mysterious color1ful liquids giving off clouds of smoke. As for adults, the majority view scientists as strange people who spend 100 hours a week slaving away in a lonely laboratory. However, the reality is quite different. Recently I've had a chance to take part in a scientific experience far from my laboratory and into Costa Rica. It supports a huge amount of wildlife due to its geographical placement between North and South America. It is home to more than 500,000 species ,which represents nearly 4% of the total species worldwide! First we worked alongside conservationists to preserve wildlife at a leatherback turtle ( )rescue center. We helped the volunteers preserve turtle populations by removing rubbish from the shoreline to create a safe environment for turtle eggs to come out. After that we stayed at Mount Arenal where we studied seismic activity relating to earthquakes. During our stay at Arenal, we rode over the mountainous areas and took a long walk through the rainforest. After reaching the top, we went down and through waterfalls to the beautiful valley below! On the last day we got a hands-on introduction to rocket science where we learned about new rocket technology that will be used on the international space station. During my Costa Rica experience, I know that being a scientist doesn't mean working in a lab all day and night. A scientist is one who loves learning and getting a better understanding of the world from helping preserve wild-life, learning about earthquakes or inventing rockets. I think that schools should really stress that science is so much more than wearing a lab coat and mixing chemicals. Kids need to be aware of the excitement and adventures science can bring! Answer:","output":"Question: What do scientists typically experience and work on outside of laboratories, according to the article? A. Sitting at their desks and reading theory books. B. Helping preserve wildlife, studying earthquakes, and inventing rockets. C. Watching documentaries on various science topics. D. Teaching science courses in schools and colleges. Answer: B.

Like most GF bread - toast it before you eat it. I like the fact that it has no preservatives but has a 1 year shelf life due to the double vacuum seal technique used. Be careful about subscribe and save though! Something went funky and I ended up getting shipped 60 loaves of bread! My BF also ended up getting duplicate orders of her subscribe and save items. So keep a close eye out! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product in a predominantly flattering light with a few reservations. There are several positive aspects mentioned by the reviewer which highlights the product's advantages, while also pointing out a potential issue related to the subscribe and save feature, which is not directly related to the product itself. Firstly, the reviewer emphasizes the great price of the gluten-free bread, stating that it \\"can't be beat.\\" This indicates that the product is financially accessible and offers a good value for its cost compared to other gluten-free options on the market. This aspect of the review would be considered very flattering for the product as price is often a significant factor in customers' decision-making processes. Furthermore, the reviewer appreciates that the bread contains no preservatives but still possesses a long, 1-year shelf life due to the double vacuum seal technique employed. This is another positive and flattering aspect of the review, as it showcases the product's commitment to providing a healthier option for those with gluten sensitivities or preferences, while also ensuring that the bread remains fresh and consumable for an extended period. The recommendation to toast the bread before consuming is a useful tip but is not necessarily a negative remark, as it reflects a common characteristic of gluten-free bread, and may not be specific to this product. Hence, it can be seen as a neutral or mildly positive comment on how to best enjoy the product. The only negative aspect of the review is related to the subscribe and save feature, which caused the reviewer to receive an excess of products, as well as a similar issue experienced by the reviewer's friend. However, this is not a direct critique of the gluten-free bread itself but rather the ordering process or system offered by the retailer. Therefore, while this part of the review is somewhat unflattering, it does not impact the overall perception of the product negatively. In conclusion, the review primarily presents the gluten-free bread product in a flattering light, with praise for its affordability, lack of preservatives, and extended shelf life. The potential issue with the subscribe and save feature, although unflattering, is not directly related to the product's quality or features, meaning that the overall impression given by the review is still quite positive."},{"instruction":"It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity). Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes. Paragraph: Two continents were separated by a large ocean.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. When were people MOST likely to overeat processed food due to a certain quality? - After not consuming salt for more than 48 hours. - not enough information - When high amounts of salt were added during processing. - When sweet and fatty foods were offered at breakfast.

From this statement, we not only understand that Rory Kinnear is the actor who portrays the character Bill Tanner but it also tells us that he has continued or 'reprised' his role, suggesting that he has already played this character in previous instances. The word 'reprised' gives us the information that Kinnear is not new to this character; he has embodied Bill Tanner prior to this instance. Moreover, the statement informs us that this is Kinnear's third appearance in the series which means he has played this role in two previous installments of the series as well.

His portrayal of Bill Tanner, a character from the James Bond series who serves as the Chief of Staff in the Secret Intelligence Service, has been appreciated by audiences. The character of Bill Tanner is a recurring one in the Bond film franchise, appearing in multiple movies as a supporting character and serving as M's right-hand man.

Place a cast-iron skillet over medium heat until the pan gets hot. Place one or two slices of microwaved pizza on the skillet using tongs. After about thirty seconds to a minute, use the tongs to lift the pizza and check the bottom. Cook until it's as crispy as you like it. Don't crowd the pan. If you put too many slices of pizza in the pan at once, the crust won't crisp evenly. If you want a crunchier finish, melt half a tablespoon of butter in the pan before heating up the pizza. This will add a buttery, deliciously flaky finish to the bottom crust. If you use a waffle iron to reheat your pizza, you can skip the microwave and oven entirely. First rearrange the toppings on the pizza. They should be clustered together in the upper left corner of the pizza slice near the crust. Then, fold the pizza. Bring the bottom point up to the top left corner and press the pizza to make a fold. Finally, press your pizza into a pre-heated waffle iron and cook for about five minutes, continually checking for doneness. If you have small pizza pieces or a large waffle iron you don't need to fold the pizza or rearrange the toppings. Instead, sandwich two pizza pieces together and press them in the waffle iron. Fresh ingredients such as basil leaves and sliced mozzarella are excellent additions to any pizza. Also consider adding some traditional pizza toppings such as olives, anchovies, and sliced bell peppers. Finally, try experimenting. Add leftovers such as diced chicken or taco meat to the top of your pizza for a fun twist. If you don't want to add new ingredients, consider using a dipping sauce such as ranch or bleu cheese dressing to spice up your leftovers.","output":"To make your pizza crust crunchy, warm up a pan and put one or two slices of pizza in it.

Sentence 2: Kathryn Harrison's status as voodoo doll is very surprising Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. While both sentences discuss Kathryn Harrison's status as a voodoo doll, they present different perspectives on the situation. Let's break down both sentences to understand this better. In the first sentence, the author presents a cause-and-effect explanation for Kathryn Harrison's status as a voodoo doll. The author argues that her status is not related to the actual quality of Harrison's book; rather, it is a result of the current climate of fears, resentments, misconceptions, and idiocies. It is a detailed explanation of the situation, mentioning various external factors responsible for her status and dismissing the possibility of her book's merits or failings being responsible. On the other hand, the second sentence states that Kathryn Harrison's status as voodoo doll is \\"very surprising.\\" There is no explanation provided for why the author finds this situation surprising, nor does the sentence discuss any factors contributing to her status. It simply expresses the author's astonishment or bemusement about her status as a voodoo doll. In conclusion, the second sentence does not follow from the first sentence, as it does not contain any logical connection that would support or confirm the statement made in the first sentence.

Does it follow that \\"The guns that allow the tax breaks for teenagers should be AK-47s.\\"?","output":"No, it does not follow that \\"The guns that allow the tax breaks for teenagers should be AK-47s.\\" This statement seems to be introducing a specific type of firearm (AK-47) as the required weapon for the proposed scheme, which was not part of the original proposition. The original proposition mentioned a tax break for every white teenager who purchases \\"a high-quality handgun.\\" There are several reasons for this assertion: 1. Definition of Handguns: AK-47s are not considered handguns. They are categorized as assault rifles due to their design, magazine capacity, and overall firepower. A handgun, typically a pistol or revolver, is designed for easy carry and use with one hand. 2. Objective of the Proposal: The original proposition talks about a potential block grant system that states could use to offer tax breaks to white teenagers who purchase a high-quality handgun. The focus appears to be on promoting responsible gun ownership and potentially supporting local businesses selling such firearms. There is no explanation of why the proposed gun for tax breaks should be an AK-47, an assault rifle used primarily for military and tactical situations. 3. Legality: In the United States, federal law regulates the sale and possession of firearms. The 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004, did restrict the manufacture and sale of newsemiautomatic assault rifles like the AK-47 in the United States. Some states have continued to maintain or implement their own specific laws concerning assault rifles, making it more complex to mandate a specific type of firearm for a proposed tax break initiative. 4. Safety and Public Perception: Creating a policy that encourages teenagers to purchase and possess assault rifles could be seen as promoting a dangerous environment and increasing the risk of gun violence. There is already considerable debate around gun control and the prevalence of firearms in the United States. Implementing a policy that supports the acquisition of powerful firearms like AK-47s among teenagers may exacerbate existing problems and generate backlash. 5. Unfairness and Discrimination: The original proposition suggests tax breaks for only white teenagers, which raises questions of racial equity and fairness. Policies that provide benefits to one specific racial or ethnic group over others can create divisions and perpetuate discrimination, further exacerbating existing societal tensions. In conclusion, it does not follow that \\"The guns that allow the tax breaks for teenagers should be AK-47s.\\" The proposal's original focus was on high-quality handguns, and introducing AK-47s as the required weapon does not align with this focus. Furthermore, promoting possession of assault rifles among teenagers could raise legal, safety, and fairness concerns, making the suggested policy change problematic in several aspects."},{"instruction":"Pick which sentence is not logical.

After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,... Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium is Frank. Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party after Shackleton left with the James Caird."},{"instruction":"Question: What type of details about matthias witthaus can be gathered from the following bio?

Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees.

On the way, the plane made a one-hour stop to refuel at the New York Airport. Thinking that he had arrived, Jack got out and spent three days in New York, believing he was in Rome. When his s were not there to meet him, Jack thought they had been caught in the heavy Roman traffic mentioned in their letters. While looking for their address, Jack could not help noticing that modernization had changed most, if not all, of the ancient city's landmarks. He also noticed that many people spoke English with strong American accent. However, he just thought that Americans got everywhere. He also believed that so many street signs were written in English especially for the Americans. Jack spoke very little English himself so he asked a policeman in Italian the way to the bus station. As chance would have it, the policeman came from Italy and replied in the same language. After twelve hours traveling round on a bus, the driver handed him over to a second policeman. After brief argument with the policeman, Jack was very surprised to find that the Rome police had employed someone who did not speak his mother tongue. Jack did not believe he was told that he was in New York.

It is not possible to tell. While the premise, \\"a man and a dog stand in the leaves,\\" may suggest that the man and the dog are outdoors, we cannot definitively confirm the hypothesis, \\"A man and a dog stand outdoors,\\" based solely on the information provided in the premise. The premise mentions the presence of leaves, which undoubtedly play a significant role in associating the scene with an outdoor setting, as leaves are commonly found outdoors, particularly during the fall season when they fall from the trees. In this sense, the premise seems to support the hypothesis because leaves are generally a characteristic of an outdoor environment. However, the premise does not explicitly mention whether the leaves are located outdoors or indoors. It is plausible that the leaves could have been brought indoors or collected in an indoor area where the man and the dog are standing. For example, they might be standing in a room decorated for an event/art installation or a part of an indoor park/play area that incorporates natural elements. While this scenario may not be as common as finding leaves outdoors, it is still a possibility that cannot be ruled out based on the information provided in the premise. In conclusion, while the premise provides a hint or suggestion that the man and the dog might be standing outdoors, it does not provide enough evidence to directly confirm or refute the hypothesis.

Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard. Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother.

In most situations, Robert's stubbornness would lead him to insist on his way and refuse to budge from his position. This could be quite frustrating for those around him, as his unyielding nature would often create tension and impede progress in whatever they were working on together. However, Matthew's patient and compromising attitude played a significant role in diffusing those tensions and leading them to effective resolutions. Recognizing the need for compromise, Matthew would take the initiative to open a dialogue with Robert, inviting him to express his thoughts and concerns, and to listen to his reasons for holding such a strong stance. By displaying genuine empathy and acknowledging the merit in Robert's points of view, Matthew was able to create an environment in which both of their opinions were valued and respected. Once they had shared their perspectives with each other, Matthew would strive to identify areas of common ground and mutual understanding. He would then suggest various potential solutions that satisfied both of their needs, while being flexible and open to suggestions from Robert. By presenting various options and emphasizing their collaborative nature, Matthew would encourage Robert to take an active role in the decision-making process, which would, in turn, make him more receptive to compromise. Robert's stubbornness, although at times difficult to navigate, also had its positive aspects. His unwavering determination often resulted in a strong drive for excellence, pushing both of them to perform at their best. Matthew's willingness to compromise, on the other hand, ensured that their partnership remained balanced, respectful, and productive. This unique dynamic between Robert's stubbornness and Matthew's propensity for compromise ultimately became a source of mutual growth and learning for both of them. They developed valuable communication and problem-solving skills that proved beneficial not only in their collaboration but also in their personal and professional lives.

Specifically, he was born in the city of Genoa, a prominent maritime and trade center during the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance period. Today, Genoa is the capital of the Liguria region in northwest Italy. Christopher Columbus, also known as Cristoforo Colombo in Italian, was born into a middle-class family in 1451, with his father, Domenico Colombo, being a wool weaver and his mother, Susanna Fontanarossa, taking care of the family. Growing up in the coastal city of Genoa, Christopher developed a keen interest in maritime activities, navigation, and ultimately, exploration. This passion would lead him to embark on numerous voyages across the Atlantic Ocean in search of faster and more efficient trade routes to Asia. Columbus is best known for his 1492 voyage, during which he reached the Americas while seeking a westward route to Asia for Spain. Although he was not the first European explorer to reach the Americas, his voyages are significant as they marked the beginning of widespread European exploration and the eventual colonization of the Americas. Columbus made a total of four voyages to the New World, further exploring the Caribbean and the Central and South American coasts. It is important to note that historical records and documentation from this period are not always complete or accurate, and there have been controversies and debates surrounding Columbus's life and actions. However, based on the majority of historical evidence and consensus among scholars, it is widely accepted that Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa, in what is now Italy."},{"instruction":"Possible review types: Pick from: (I). negative.

Solution:","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements in the question: - concurrent growth rate - transcript analyses - essential gene stringency - Escherichia coli Step 2: Identify the key elements in the answer: - RNA silencing - stringent requirements - gene expression - growth - validate existing essential genes - quantify drug target requirement Step 3: Compare the key elements in the question and answer to see if they match or are related: - The question mentions concurrent growth rate and transcript analyses, while the answer refers to RNA silencing as a method to reveal stringent requirements for gene expression and growth. Although not the same, RNA silencing could potentially involve analyzing transcripts, so there is a loose connection here. - The question asks about essential gene stringency in Escherichia coli, and the answer discusses validating existing essential genes and quantifying drug target requirements. This suggests the answer is addressing the concept of essential genes to some extent. Step 4: Determine if the answer addresses the question: Since the answer does address essential genes and has a loose connection to transcript analyses, it seems to offer some insight into the question. However, it does not specifically address the concurrent growth rate and it does not specifically mention Escherichia coli. The answer is not a direct yes or no to the question, but it does offer related information.

The statement only provides information about Hawking's thoughts on the origin of time and the beginning of the universe, but it does not mention any specific philosopher who has criticized his views. The philosopher in question who criticized Stephen Hawking's view that time began with the Big Bang and that questions about what happened before the Big Bang are meaningless is Sir Roger Penrose. Sir Roger Penrose, a renowned British mathematician and physicist, has expressed concerns with the concept of time beginning with the Big Bang, arguing that it may be part of a larger cosmic cycle. Penrose developed the \\"Conformal Cyclic Cosmology\\" (CCC) hypothesis, which proposes that our universe is just one phase within a larger sequence of infinite cosmic cycles, each lasting ~10^100 years (conventional lifetime of a single universe). Each cycle begins with a Big Bang and ends with an unbounded expansion, called the 'cosmic eternity,' which is proposed to be naturally equivalent to the initial Big Bang singularity of the next cycle. While Stephen Hawking's ideas on the nature of time and the beginning of the universe have been influential in shaping our understanding of cosmology, they are not without their critics. It is important to note that the field of theoretical physics is complex and dynamic, with many competing ideas and hypotheses constantly evolving as new data and insights are gathered. As such, the conversation around the origins of the universe and the nature of time is an ongoing and fascinating area of study for both physicists and philosophers."},{"instruction":"An openly gay former Dominican friar insisted today that homosexuality is the ‘ticking time bomb in the Catholic Church’ and that homosexual men are ‘massively over-represented’ within the Church. Mark Dowd, who is now a journalist, said research for his 2001 Channel 4 documentary Queer and Catholic suggested that at least half of people attracted into seminaries in the priesthood are gay. His comments came as the former leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, said the scandal-hit Catholic Church must undergo renewal and reform. Scroll down for video. Former friar: Mark Dowd, who is now a journalist, said research for his 2001 Channel 4 documentary Queer and Catholic had suggested at least half of people attracted into seminaries in the priesthood are gay. Mr Dowd told CNN: ‘When you have this culture of secrecy and guilt and repression, you have conditions which foster the potential for blackmail and for manipulation. ‘This is a very unhealthy stage for the church, because basically when you have secrecy, you have lies - and when you have lies, people often are put in terrible pressures of being compromised.’ Meanwhile, the Cardinal said the successor to Benedict XVI would need to be able to tackle reform of the Roman Curia, the Vatican departments which govern the 1.2billion-strong global church. Last weekend Italian newspapers published claims of homosexuality and blackmail within the Church, with one allegation centering around a secret ‘gay cabal’ of priests, reported CNN. But veteran Vatican journalist Marco Politi said this idea was ‘rubbish’, adding: ‘Here in the Vatican, there are monsignors who have love affairs, with women and with men. But they hide it.’ Mr Dowd added: ‘I've got my own experience of being in religious life myself. And I can tell you that gay men are massively, massively overrepresented in Catholic life. There's nothing wrong with that. Vatican: Italian media ran a series of stories last week about the alleged contents of a secret report prepared for the Pope by a commission of three cardinals who investigated the Vatileaks scandal last year. ‘The problem is that a lot of them are told that they are intrinsically unhealthy according to church teaching. And that's not a very appropriate state of affairs if we're talking about psychosexual health and emotional maturity.’ 'I've got my own experience of being in religious life myself. And I can tell you that gay men are massively, massively overrepresented in Catholic life' Mark Dowd, former Dominican friar. Earlier this week Britain’s most senior Roman Catholic, Cardinal Keith O’Brien, apologised for his failures after being ordered to quit by the Pope as a further sex scandal swept the church. Italian media ran stories last week about the alleged contents of a secret report prepared for the Pope by a commission of three cardinals who investigated the Vatileaks scandal last year. Paolo Gabriele, the pope's butler, was convicted of stealing personal papal documents and leaking them to the media. He was jailed and later pardoned by the pope. The documents alleged corruption in the Vatican and infighting over the running of its bank, which has been at the heart of a series of scandals in past decades. But the Vatican said the Italian media had spread 'false and damaging' reports and claimed it was an attempt to influence cardinals who will meet in a secret conclave next month to elect a new pope. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Mark Dowd, an openly gay former Dominican friar and journalist, claims that homosexuality is the \\"ticking time bomb in the Catholic Church\\" and that homosexual men are \\"massively over-represented\\" within the institution.

In 1474, it was merged to the partition of Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania, who four years later became the sole duke of Pomerania. - Lower Saxony is a German state (\\"Bundesland\\") situated in northwestern Germany and is second in area, with , and fourth in population (8 million) among the sixteen \\"Länder\\" of Germany.

It is bordered by (from the west and clockwise) the district of Stormarn, the city of Lübeck, the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (districts of Nordwestmecklenburg and Ludwigslust-Parchim), the state of Lower Saxony (districts of Lüneburg and Harburg), and the city state of Hamburg. The district of Herzogtum Lauenburg is named after the former Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg. - The Duchy of Pomerania was partitioned several times to satisfy the claims of the male members of the ruling House of Pomerania dynasty. The partitions were named after the ducal residences: Pomerania-Barth, -Demmin, -Rügenwalde, -Stettin, -Stolp, and -Wolgast. None of the partitions had a hereditary character, the members of the House of Pomerania inherited the duchy in common. The duchy thus continued to exist as a whole despite its division. The only exception was made during a war with the Margraviate of Brandenburg, when in 1338 Barnim III of Pomerania-Stettin was granted his partition as a fief directly from the Holy Roman Emperor, while Pomerania-Wolgast remained under formal Brandenburgian overlordship. However, already in 1348, German king and later emperor Charles IV again granted the Duchy of Pomerania as a whole and the Principality of Rügen as a fief to the dukes of both Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast, nullifying Brandenburg's claims by granting Imperial immediacy.

The audio stream is available from both CBC Music and from iTunes Radio, but geographical restrictions are in place to prevent access outside of Canada. The network evolved out of programming on CBC Radio 2, which also simulcasted the satellite network on Saturday and Sunday nights from its debut in December 2005 until March 17, 2007. Radio 3 is no longer heard on terrestrial radio, but is still available through its satellite radio and Internet operations. From 2005 to 2009, the Icecast stream available from the network's website was not a simulcast of the satellite radio broadcast, but was programmed separately. Initially, the webstream consisted exclusively of music with the occasional identification break, but on September 14, 2007 it was relaunched with hosts and feature content, similar to but still programmed separately from the satellite radio station. Due to funding cuts, however, the two services were merged in June 2009, such that the webstream is now a straight simulcast of the satellite radio channel. Prior to the merger, the two services had slightly different programming strategies - the satellite radio station aired a music mix of 85 per cent Canadian and 15 per cent international, while the web service's mix was 100 per cent Canadian. With the merger of the two services, the station announced that the program mix would be 100 per cent Canadian music on both platforms, although exceptions will be permitted for international music with some Canadian character - such as international artists covering Canadian songs, collaborations between Canadian and non-Canadian artists, international artists appearing on the bill with Canadian artists when the network is airing a live concert, or \\"honourary [sic] Canadian\\" artists such as Neko Case and Rose Melberg. In February 2009, CBC Radio 3 participated with Exclaim! and aux.tv to launch X3, a new collaborative cross-promotional platform which sees all three outlets air feature content spotlighting a particular \\"Artist of the Month\\". X3 artists of the month have included K'naan, Malajube, Thunderheist, Japandroids, Apostle of Hustle, The Rural Alberta Advantage, Owen Pallett, and Jenn Grant. In addition to the service's conventional radio programming, any song in the network's music library can also be played on demand from the artist's profile page on the site. In May 2011, Joel Plaskett became the first artist in the network's history to reach one million on-demand plays. In 2012, CBC Radio 3 was integrated into the new CBC Music service. Did they do any webcasts after Icecast?","output":"Yes, after the Icecast stream, CBC Radio 3 did webcasts.

Step-by-step justification: 1. \\"For eight years\\" - The subject of this phrase is \\"eight years,\\" which translates to \\"opt ani\\" in Romanian. The preposition \\"for\\" is translated into \\"pentru\\" in this context. 2. \\"The Pact\\" - The subject of this phrase is \\"Pact,\\" which does not need to be translated as it is a proper noun, but the article \\"the\\" should be translated into the Romanian definite article \\"ul\\" (while in this case we don't use it because the noun stands as neutral - Pactul). 3. \\"has helped\\" - This verb is in present perfect tense, meaning that this action started in the past and has effects up to the present moment. In Romanian, the analogous tense is called \\"perfect compus.\\" To translate the verb \\"to help\\" (a ajuta), we need the auxiliary verb \\"a fi\\" (to be) and the past participle of the main verb, \\"ajutat.\\" 4. \\"the region\\" - The noun \\"region\\" translates to \\"regiune\\" in Romanian, and \\"the\\" is translated into the definite article \\"a\\" which in this context changes the noun to \\"regiunea.\\" 5. \\"to get on tract\\" - The infinitive form of \\"to get\\" is \\"a obține\\" in Romanian. The word \\"tract\\" can be translated as \\"căi\\" or \\"drum\\" (meaning \\"path\\" or \\"way\\"). In this context, \\"on tract\\" would mean \\"to get on the right path\\" or \\"to steer in the right direction,\\" which can be translated as \\"să se îndrepte\\" towards. 6. \\"to stabilise\\" - The infinitive form of \\"to stabilise\\" is \\"a stabiliza\\" in Romanian. 7. \\"and\\" - The conjunction \\"and\\" is translated to \\"și\\" in Romanian. 8. \\"grow\\" - The infinitive form of \\"to grow\\" is \\"a crește\\" in Romanian.

Harland Sanders was born on September 9, 1890, in Henryville, Indiana, United States. His full name is Harland David Sanders, and his title \\"Colonel\\" was bestowed in recognition of his contributions to local cuisine in 1935 by Kentucky Governor Ruby Laffoon, making him an honorary Kentucky Colonel. The title was reissued in 1949 by Governor Lawrence Wetherby. Colonel Harland Sanders' journey to KFC fame began in 1930 when he started operating a service station in Corbin, Kentucky. It was at this location where he started serving his legendary fried chicken to travelers. Over time, the popularity of his fried chicken grew, and he ended up opening a restaurant at the service station. This was the birth of the concept that would come to be known as Kentucky Fried Chicken in the following years. In 1952, Colonel Harland Sanders began franchising his fried chicken concept, allowing other businesses to use his recipe and name, thus creating the foundation for what would become the global KFC franchise. The first official KFC franchise was opened in Salt Lake City, Utah, by Pete Harman, a friend of Sanders. The partnership between Harman and Sanders was pivotal in creating the brand's image and standardizing the cooking process, which later became the secret to KFC's success. Colonel Harland Sanders' famous fried chicken recipe, known as the \\"Original Recipe,\\" is made with a unique blend of 11 herbs and spices, which remains a closely-guarded secret to this day. In fact, it is said that the recipe is locked away in a vault at KFC headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky. As a result of Sanders' persistence and entrepreneurship, KFC has become one of the largest and most successful fast-food chains internationally, with more than 22,000 locations in over 135 countries. Colonel Harland Sanders remained actively involved in the business despite selling the KFC corporation in 1964. He continued to represent the company as the goodwill ambassador and the face of the brand until his death on December 16, 1980. Nevertheless, Colonel Sanders' iconic image, complete with his white suit and black string tie, still graces KFC restaurants worldwide, symbolizing his lasting impact on the fast-food industry and the enduring legacy of his famous fried chicken recipe."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given an open-domain question from an open movie database.

English essays generally involve analyzing, interpreting, or evaluating a particular subject, such as a piece of literature, an event, or an idea. It requires the writer to engage in critical thinking, as well as to present a clear and coherent argument supported by evidence. The process typically begins with brainstorming and planning, followed by drafting, revising, and editing. Writing an English essay requires a solid understanding of the topic, the ability to analyze various perspectives, and excellent writing skills, which include proper grammar, punctuation, and organization. A Roman sacrificial ceremony, on the other hand, was a religious ritual performed in ancient Rome to appease the gods and seek their favor. These ceremonies were an important part of Roman society, as they believed that the gods held significant power over their lives and the events in the world around them. Sacrifices, whether animal or sometimes even human, were offered to the gods in temples or on altars in public spaces. The ceremonies were carefully planned and orchestrated events, involving specific rituals, prayers, and offerings. Participants in these ceremonies strove to show respect and devotion to the gods through their actions and offerings. Now, let's examine the sentiment of the tweet. The tweet juxtaposes the idea of writing an English essay with planning a Roman sacrificial ceremony, which are both intricate and detail-oriented tasks. This could imply that the user is signalling their intention to immerse themselves into a challenging and intellectually stimulating endeavor. They express enthusiasm and excitement for exploring these subjects and possibly seeking knowledge, understanding, or even guidance. The sentiment of this tweet could be described as intellectually curious, eager, or ambitious. It demonstrates the user's willingness to embrace new knowledge and experiences, as well as to confront complex ideas and tasks. By mentioning two seemingly unrelated topics, the tweet could also be seen as whimsical or humorous, adding a lighthearted touch to the sentiment. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mixture of intellectual curiosity, enthusiasm, ambition, and witty humor. The user is eager to engage in challenging tasks and explore subjects that may require hard work and critical thinking while maintaining a playfulness in their approach."},{"instruction":"Aceştia au idei de dezvoltare, dar duc lipsă de fonduri, şi este clar că, dacă aceste întreprinderi nu se pot dezvolta, nu vor fi create nici noi locuri de muncă; crearea de locuri de muncă reprezintă totuşi o condiţie prealabilă pentru ieşirea din criza economică.

Possible A: painting, triple crown, apples, race track, kentucky derby Why is \\"triple crown\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Triple Crown\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it relates directly to horse racing and winning multiple prestigious races. Step 1: Analyze the question - The question asks about a horse that has won many races and what it can hope to achieve. Step 2: Identify relevant concepts - In this context, we need to look for achievements related to winning multiple horse races. Step 3: Evaluate possible answers - We compare each of the possible answers provided with the relevant concepts identified in step 2: - Painting: This is unrelated to horse racing and winning multiple prestigious races. - Triple Crown: This refers to a series of three prestigious races in horse racing - the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. Winning all three races is a rare and significant achievement for a horse. - Apples: This is unrelated to horse racing and winning multiple prestigious races. - Race Track: This is simply the venue where races take place and not an achievement related to winning races. - Kentucky Derby: This is one of the prestigious races a horse can win, but it's a single race rather than an overall achievement for winning multiple races. Step 4: Select the most appropriate answer - Based on our evaluation in step 3, we can conclude that \\"Triple Crown\\" is the most appropriate answer aligned with human common sense. It directly relates to the achievement a horse can hope for after winning many races, and is a significant accomplishment in the horse racing world."},{"instruction":"BTW he had appropriate deferments for the time. Appropriate deferments for the time, eh? On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","output":"In order to evaluate the meaning overlap between the two sentences, let's break them down: Sentence 1: \\"BTW he had appropriate deferments for the time.\\" - This sentence indicates that the person being referred to had valid reasons for postponing or avoiding a specific obligation or duty during a particular time. The use of \\"BTW\\" (by the way) makes the sentence appear as additional information related to a previous conversation. Sentence 2: \\"Appropriate deferments for the time, eh?\\" - This sentence phrases the idea of the first sentence in the form of a question. It still centers around the same concept of having valid reasons for postponement during a specific time. The use of \\"eh\\" gives it a questioning tone, which might imply some doubt or seek confirmation. Considering the analysis, I would rate the meaning overlap between the two sentences as a 4 out of 5. Although the second sentence is phrased as a question, both sentences convey the same general idea about having appropriate deferments during a specific time frame. The sense of doubt or seeking confirmation in the second sentence reduces the overlap from a perfect 5."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Young girls are literally being drained of their youth, so Dr Marcus [John Carson] sends for professional vampire hunter Captain Kronos [Horst Janson] who brings along his hunchbacked assistant Professor Hieronymous Grost [John Cater] and Carla [Caroline Munro], a girl they saved from a stockade.

Movie title: She's the One Context: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\".

They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still produces a global human population that is genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations. How much human genetic diversity exists in a single African population? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"According to Long and Kittles in their 2003 paper, about 100% of human genetic diversity exists in a single African population. This is because Africa is considered to be the ancestral birthplace of modern humans, and therefore consists of the most diverse set of human genes. It is important to note that the percentages of genetic diversity mentioned in their paper are based on their findings and interpretation of human population history and relationships. As research continues, these numbers might vary, but their findings still highlight the high level of genetic diversity within African populations compared to other groups around the world."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"An angry brown horse seems to be trying to buck off the male rider in tan jeans and blue shirt and black hat.\\" Hypothesis: \\"While a photographer shoots a picture.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

And next year,Rowena will be attending Harvard University.Billy,her younger brother,hopes to go to Cornell.What makes Rowena and Billy different from most students is that they don't go to school.In fact,they've never been to school.Since kindergarten,they've studied at home.Like many of more than one million people who receive home schooling in the United States, they feel as if they've gotten a good education. The home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job? The answer in many cases is yes.In many studies,students taught at home ranked average or above average when compared to students who went to public schools.More importantly,these students were often more self-directed and have a greater depth of knowledge.They were well prepared for academic challenges. One such student,Robert Conrad, now a sophomore at university, claims he really learned how to study and schedule his time during his eight years of home schooling.Still, not every student is as successful as Robert. \\"For every home-schooling success story,there are an equal number of failures.\\"states Henry Lipscomb,an educational researcher.\\"There are just so many disadvantages that students taught at home have to overcome.\\" For example,they have fewer chances to get in touch with others of their own age.Consequently,they sometimes lack the usual social skills.\\"No matter what,though,\\"states Lipscomb,\\"home-schooling is a growing trend.I think we'll be seeing more and more of this.\\" Question: The writer thinks _ .

They believe that in many cases, students who receive home-schooling perform average or above average when compared to public school students, as they are well-prepared for academic challenges, more self-directed, and have a greater depth of knowledge. However, the writer also acknowledges that for every home-schooling success story, there are an equal number of failures. Home-schooled students might face disadvantages, such as fewer chances to interact with their peers and possibly lacking in social skills. Despite these drawbacks, the writer expects the home-schooling trend to continue growing."},{"instruction":"Question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Not able to send messages always gets an error if socket session time out\\" Answer:","output":"I will evaluate the review based on its content and assign a star rating accordingly.

But for Adrienne White, seven field seasons along the northern reaches of Ellesmere Island give the numbers real-world immediacy. They all retreated. Nothing is growing. - Adrienne White, University of Ottawa glaciologist \\"I've been actually able to see with my own eyes, to the point where there were some areas I couldn't recognize between years,\\" said White, a University of Ottawa glaciologist. \\"One year you're Ski-Dooing over the ridges of these ice shelves, and then you go back the year after and [it's] like a city of icebergs.\\" White has catalogued and studied the condition of more than 1,700 glaciers on the High Arctic island, both on the ground and from satellite imagery. She looked at glaciers on land and flowing into the ocean as well as at ice shelves floating on top of the sea. Out of 1,773 glaciers, 1,353 shrank significantly between 2000 and 2016. All of them shrank a little bit, said White. \\"What I saw when I was measuring was 100 per cent of glaciers retreating,\\" she said. \\"They all retreated. Nothing is growing.\\" White found glaciers lost more than 1,700 square kilometres. That's a loss of almost six per cent over a period of 16 years. Most of these glaciers probably aren't coming back. Glaciers not accumulating snow The Canadian Arctic is experiencing some of the fastest climate warming anywhere on Earth. The annual average temperature on Ellesmere Island has increased by 3.6 degrees. Data from other points in the Arctic suggest rising temperatures mean the elevation needed for snow to last through the summer has risen by 300 metres. White found most of Ellesmere's glaciers are no longer high enough to accumulate snow. \\"I don't see snow surviving throughout the summer,\\" she said. \\"You need that year-long snow to be able to accumulate and create more ice and I just don't see that. An iceberg floating in the Baffin Bay above the Arctic Circle dwarfs the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker Louis S. St-Laurent on July 10, 2008. (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press) \\"Over 50 per cent of the glaciers are completely in the ablation zone, [where] 100 per cent of the glacier area is undergoing melt. No part of that glacier is creating more ice.\\" White's work echoes earlier research that found Ellesmere's glaciers began shrinking several decades before her study began. Although she's not able to say whether that retreat is speeding up, the rate of warming is increasing. Until the mid-1990s, the average temperature climbed about 0.12 degrees per decade. From 1995 to 2016, the increase was 0.78 degrees per decade. It's hard to say what the consequences of shrinking glaciers will be, said White. There will be some impact on sea-level rise and the melting ice is likely to release more and larger icebergs into the water, she said. Little is known about the area, which is so remote that until recently it couldn't even be found on Google Earth. One thing is certain, though, said White. \\"It is a big change.\\" ||||| Hundreds of glaciers in Canada’s high Arctic are shrinking and many are at risk of disappearing completely, an unprecedented inventory of glaciers in the country’s northernmost island has revealed. Using satellite imagery, researchers catalogued more than 1,700 glaciers in northern Ellesmere Island and traced how they had changed between 1999 and 2015. The results offered a glimpse into how warming temperatures may be affecting ice in the region, from glaciers that sprawl across the land to the 200-metre thick ice shelves, said Adrienne White, a glaciologist at the University of Ottawa. “It’s an area that’s very difficult to study,” said White. “Logistically it’s very hard to get to and even with satellite imagery – for the longest time Google Earth didn’t even have complete imagery – it was kind of the forgotten place.” Glacier loss is accelerating because of global warming | John Abraham Read more White’s study, published last month in the Journal of Glaciology, found that the glaciers had shrank by more than 1,700 sq km of over a 16-year period, representing a loss of about 6%. A previous study of glaciers in the region – which used air photos and did not include ice shelves – showed a loss of 927 sq km between 1959 and 2000, hinting that the pace of loss may be increasing. Facebook Twitter Pinterest In northern Ellesmere Island, the annual average temperature in the region increased by 3.6C between 1948 and 2016. Photograph: Adrienne White Of the 1,773 glaciers tracked by White, 1,353 were found to have shrunk significantly. A handful had disappeared altogether: “What we found is a loss of three complete ice shelves,” she said. “In terms of glaciers that terminate on land, we’ve lost three small ice caps.” None of the glaciers in the study showed any signs of growing. The findings echo the changes White has observed during her years of visiting the island. “We see a lot more icebergs,” said White. “Where there was one continuous ice shelf, we now see individual icebergs broken up, we see a lot more crevasses.” She attributed the findings to an increase in temperatures. Canada’s Arctic – one of the world’s most glaciated regions – is warming at one of the fastest rates of anywhere on Earth. In northern Ellesmere Island, the annual average temperature in the region increased by 3.6C between 1948 and 2016. In particular, “there seemed to be a shift in the mid-90s,” she said, describing it as a “sudden increase in warming,” that saw temperatures increase at about 0.78C per decade between 1995 and 2016. “These increases were greatest in autumn and winter,” she said. “So what you end up with is a lot more melt.” While the most direct impact is rising sea levels, the melting ice also risks wiping out the region’s unique ecosystems, such as the freshwater lakes that form when the water flowing off a glacier is trapped by a floating ice shelf. “When these glaciers break away, all of a sudden there’s nothing holding back these ecosystems that have been growing and developing for thousands of years,” said White. “And they’re gone before we even have the chance to study them.” Extrapolating from research done on glaciers from a neighbouring island, White’s study suggested that many of the glaciers on northern Ellesmere Island may not be high enough to accumulate enough snow to counter the pace at which they are melting. “Without growth, that glacier is just in a state of loss,” she said. “It will disappear if climates don’t change.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Over 1,700 glaciers in Canada’s high Arctic are at risk of disappearing due to climate change, according to research from the University of Ottawa.

The Free Methodist Church has identified the woman as the Rev. Phyllis Sortor, a missionary based at the Hope Academy compound in Kogi state. Kogi state is located away from the areas where Boko Haram operates, making it likely that the kidnapping is not related to terrorism. But there is also the possibility that an offshoot group could have kidnapped Sortor, or that she might be sold to another group. Police have not said if they suspect a certain group or band of criminals. Sortor was kidnapped on Monday, Ogunjemilusi said. The U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and the FBI have been notified of the incident, the Free Methodist Church said. Sortor runs a nongovernmental organization that educates nomadic Fulani children, the police commissioner said. According to her biography on the church's website, Sortor is the financial administrator of Hope Academy. \\"A special friendship with a clan of nomadic Fulani has given Phyllis the opportunity to open additional schools for Fulani children and their parents,\\" the website says. The commissioner said five men scaled the wall of the school where Sortor's office is and \\"whisked her away,\\" jumping back over the wall and fleeing to the nearby mountains. Two of the men were masked, and they fired shots into the air to scare people away during the kidnapping, Ogunjemilusi said.

PUBLISHED:. 17:43 EST, 25 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 08:39 EST, 26 July 2013. For generations it has been the family friendly board game used to while away a rainy afternoon. But it seems the latest generation of Monopoly players are simply too busy for the full version of the game. Instead its makers, Hasbro, have launched a new kids version of the classic which can be completed in less than half an hour so it can fit into its young players’ busy schedules. Monopoly Empire is on the list of top toy predictions for youngsters with an action packed schedule and short attention span. Manufacturers say the new Monopoly Empire game, which is aimed at children of eight and older, is meeting demand in the market from youngsters who simply don’t have the attention span to play for hours. Either that or they cant fit it in among their frantic schedules of ballet classes and football practice. In America, makers of the US version. of the game have become so concerned by busy pre-teens that they. have even eliminated the jail, so children don’t waste time waiting to. roll a double. And Hasbro aren’t the only ones making their games quicker to play. As. a whole the toy industry have made a move to offer what they call. ‘snack toys’ to appeal to children who have very little play time. because of their action packed days. Toy. manufacturers have been updating other games such as Scrabble and. Boggle with new speedier versions to keep the attention of their. increasingly distracted young customers. How it used to be: Mother and son spending quality time together playing Monopoly - back then children were encouraged to build a property empire on the classic board or even 'go to jail' Thanks to its new incarnation as Scrabble Flash, it is now possible to complete a round of the classic word game in just two and a half minutes. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, pictured at her home in Harrow. She says: 'The frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game' Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said the development of these shorter games showed how traditional board games had become a casualty of modern society but added that even playing a short game was better than watching endless hours of TV. She said: ‘The frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game. ‘With many families having both dad and mum out at work all day, evenings are more likely to be spent doing homework or household chores than leisurely playing board games. ‘So at first glance this seems a sad indictment of the breakneck speed we live our lives. However, as society isn’t going to change anytime soon, perhaps it is simple Monopoly being pragmatic. ‘If a short version encourages young kids to get into the game instead of watching TV or playing on the computer, then it would be welcomed by many parents.’ And it appears it is not just the children that have increasingly hectic schedules to keep up with. Last year a joined survey with Netmums and toy manufacturers Mattel questioned more than 1,200 parents and found that more than a quarter are now so busy they only play board games with their families twice a year. But it’s not just the length of play that has changed with the new edition of Monopoly, in a surrender to 21st century commercialism children are now encouraged to buy and sell brands rather than properties as they move around the board. Hasbro, the world’s largest board game maker, has sought the involvement of leading global brands such as Mc Donalds, X-Box and Coca Cola which occupy the spaces on the board ones marked out by the streets of London. Instead of building houses and hotels children collect tiles relating to each brand and use them to build up their own skyscraper in the centre of the board. The winner is the first to complete their skyscraper. Computer games, toys, ballet and sport are keeping children too busy to sit down with their families - the classic Monopoly board game is being updated to compete for the attention of pre-teens. But Mrs Freegard maintains that if these shorter games give children a taste for the joy of a good board game, it still may mean a resurrection of the full version as they get older. She added: ‘Lots of eight year olds also don’t have the concentration for the full version and mastering the short game will undoubtedly improve their skills and teach them patience. ‘And if they enjoy the short version, it will encourage them to try the longer version, preserving an interest in board games for the next generation.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses how Hasbro has launched Monopoly Empire, a new, quicker version of the classic Monopoly board game, aimed at children aged eight and older.

Snejana Farberov. PUBLISHED:. 09:49 EST, 17 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:34 EST, 17 January 2013. Archaeologists in Panama have made a surprising discovery, unearthing a collection of mysterious shaman's stones that have been hidden from view inside a cave for nearly 5,000 years. The dozen rocks of various shapes and sizes were uncovered in the Casita de Piedra rock shelter located in the Isthmus of Panama. They are now believed to be the earliest material evidence of shamanic rituals in that part of Central America, according to researchers. Charcoal found directly underneath the geological stash in the back of a small, prehistoric cave was carbon-dated to 4,800 years ago, while a second fragment of charcoal above the stones was dated to 4,000 years ago, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama reported Monday. Stones: Archaeologists have unearthed nearly 5,000-year-old shaman's stones, pictured, in a rock shelter in Panama. The findings were published online December 27 in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, LiveScience reported. The 12 rocks were found clustered tightly together, suggesting that several millenniums ago, they were brought by a healer or shaman in a bag, which had since long disintegrated. The rock shelter where the find was made has been known to researchers since the 1970s. In 2006, Ruth Dickau, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter in the UK, took another look at the location and determined that contrary to previous beliefs, it had been used by people as a shed for cooking and tool-making for over 9,000 years. Sharmen: The stones are now believed to be the earliest material evidence of the rituals of the healers, as illustrated left, in that part of Central America. Discovery: The 12 stones were found in the Casita de Piedra rock shelter, pictured, in the Isthmus of Panama. It was during a dig at the site that Dickau stumbled upon the mysterious pile of stones, among them translucent quartz, pyrite, magnetic rocks. Some of the rocks contained grains of iron and showed magnetic properties by deflecting a compass needle. Study co-author and consulting geologist Stewart Redwood said in a statement that the shamanic stones originated from a remote, gold-rich region of Panama known as the Central Cordillera up to 3,000 years before gold prospecting began there. 'We will never be entirely sure how the ancient people used the stones in the past,' Dickau wrote. To this day, shamans in Costa Rica chant and blow tobacco smoke over crystals to make contact with spirits or diagnose an illness.","output":"Archaeologists in Panama have discovered a collection of mysterious shaman's stones inside a cave dating back nearly 5,000 years.

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, the suggested answer provides a correct and concise explanation of what tofu is made of. Tofu is indeed created from soybeans, and the process includes coagulating soy juice (or soy milk) and pressing the subsequent curds into the familiar white blocks. To offer more detailed information, tofu is a popular plant-based protein source that originated in China over 2,000 years ago and has since become a widely consumed food in many countries, particularly in East and Southeast Asia. Tofu has grown in popularity thanks to its versatility in various culinary dishes and its health benefits. The process of making tofu involves a few key steps: 1. Soybean selection and preparation: The journey of tofu starts with the selection of high-quality soybeans. The soybeans are soaked in water to soften them and ease the process of separating the soy milk. 2. Extraction of soy milk: The softened soybeans are then ground together with water and heated. The resulting slurry is strained, separating the solids (okara) from the liquid (soy milk). The soy milk is the primary ingredient for making tofu. 3. Coagulation of soy milk: To transform soy milk into tofu, a coagulant is added. Popular coagulants include calcium sulfate (gypsum), magnesium chloride (nigari), or an acidic ingredient like lemon juice or vinegar. The coagulant causes the proteins in the soy milk to coagulate, forming curds. 4. Curd separation and pressing: Once the curds have formed, they are separated from the remaining liquid (whey) using a cheesecloth or similar material. The curds are then placed in a mold and pressed to remove excess whey and form the block of tofu. Tofu comes in various textures and firmness levels, ranging from silken to extra-firm, depending on the amount of liquid removed during the pressing stage. This versatile ingredient can be used in a wide array of dishes, including stir-fries, soups, salads, and even desserts. In conclusion, the suggested answer accurately describes the main components and process of making tofu. Validating this answer would be appropriate, as it provides an informative and correct response to the question."},{"instruction":"Arsanjani, supra, note 74, à la p.

Question: suppose Less air is pulled into the lungs happens, how will it affect less oxygen moves into the blood stream. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less When less air is pulled into the lungs, it directly affects the amount of oxygen that can be transferred into the bloodstream. The process of pulling air into the lungs is known as inspiration or inhalation. This is a critical part of the respiratory process, as it allows fresh oxygen to enter the lungs, where gas exchange occurs. During gas exchange, the oxygen molecules from the air you have inhaled diffuse across the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs) and through the capillary walls into the bloodstream. This process is made possible by the large surface area of the lungs, which is covered in billions of alveoli. When the lungs are full of air, they offer a larger surface area for oxygen exchange, thus increasing the efficiency of the respiratory process. When less air is pulled into the lungs, the surface area of the lungs available for oxygen exchange decreases. As a result, there will be a smaller amount of oxygen available for transfer into the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, oxygen attaches to the hemoglobin molecule found in red blood cells, forming oxyhemoglobin. This carries the oxygen throughout the body to the various tissues and organs that require it for metabolic processes. If less oxygen moves into the bloodstream, it means that less oxygen will be available for distribution to the body’s tissues. This can lead to a condition known as hypoxia, which occurs when the cells in the body do not receive an adequate supply of oxygen. Mild hypoxia can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness, while severe hypoxia can lead to more serious complications such as cognitive dysfunction, organ failure, and death. In conclusion, when less air is pulled into the lungs, it leads to less oxygen moving into the bloodstream. This can have various consequences on the body's overall health and functioning, as it deprives the body's cells and tissues of the necessary oxygen required for their metabolic processes."},{"instruction":"Q:- The virus has receptors that lock onto a target cell - The virus enters the cell - The virus uses the cell like a factory to make new copies of the virus - The new copies of the virus leave the cell - Infect other cells - The host gets sick as its cells are damaged.

This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge. Question: \\"What type of region might a floodplain develop into if a river floods often?\\" Answer: \\"Very flat\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. The question asks: \\"What type of region might a floodplain develop into if a river floods often?\\" The answer to this question, based on the provided information, is not simply \\"very flat.\\" While it is indeed true that floodplains are often flat due to the spread of floodwater, the question is asking about the potential development of floodplains due to frequent flooding. Instead, a more appropriate and detailed answer might be: A floodplain that frequently experiences flooding might develop into a region characterized by nutrient-rich soil due to the sediment left behind by the floodwater. The sediment that the floodwater carries and subsequently deposits enriches the soil of the floodplain. This makes it an ideal place for plant growth and agriculture, as seen in the example of the Nile River valley. The regular flooding by the Nile River brings sediment that turns the surrounding floodplain into a productive agricultural area, despite it being in the middle of a desert. The floodplain could also develop natural levees along the river banks. Levees are raised strips of sediment that the floodwater deposits close to the river's edge. These occur naturally and can act as a protective barrier, potentially reducing the impact of future floods. Over time, frequent floods can lead to the growth of these levees and further change the physical characteristics of the floodplain region. Hence, a floodplain subjected to regular flooding might develop into a highly fertile agricultural region with potentially significant natural levee formations along the riverbanks."},{"instruction":"Add spaces: Alwaysreadyforyourvisitindividually,withfamily,celebrating,ataconferenceorasparticipantinanytypeofevent.Wewillhelpyoucreateamemorablestay.","output":"Step 1: Identify distinct words and phrases in the original text - In order to add spaces properly, I need to recognize individual and distinct words.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Problem:Context: The film depicts the construction and ultimate demolition of a metaphorical wall. Though the film's symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation.Pink (Bob Geldof), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \\"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944.The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \\"Money\\" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants.As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror.Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \\"worms\\". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform.The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \\"Waiting for the Worms\\". The scene is inter-cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins.Pink screams \\"Stop!\\" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd's \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" from The Final Cut album and \\"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity)\\" from Roger Waters' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.The film concludes with three children cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot. It is unknown whatever has happened to Pink, leaving the viewer to decide. Question: Who sang \\"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\\"?

The real Everingham was cast as an extra in the film. Sam's Son was a 1984 coming-of-age feature film written and directed by Landon and loosely based on his early life. The film stars Timothy Patrick Murphy, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Hallie Todd, and James Karen. Karen previously worked for Landon in the made-for-television film Little House: The Last Farewell. After the cancellation of Highway to Heaven and before his move to CBS, Landon wrote and directed the teleplay Where Pigeons Go to Die. Based on a novel of the same name, the film starred Art Carney and was nominated for two Emmy awards. Up through the run of Highway to Heaven, all of Landon's television programs were broadcast on NBC, a relationship of which lasted thirty consecutive years with the network. After the cancellation of Highway and due to a fallout with those within NBC's upper management, he moved to CBS and in 1991 starred in a two-hour pilot called Us. Us was meant to be another series for Landon but, with his diagnosis on April 5 of pancreatic cancer, the show never aired beyond the pilot. Landon also appeared as a celebrity panelist on the premiere week of Match Game on CBS. Question: What is one of Michael Landon's other projects?

In tonight’s episode Game of Thrones presented not one but two epic battles for the fate of Westeros and Essos. Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons squared off against the slavers while Jon Snow and his northernmen fought back against the Boltons. The stakes seemed incredibly high and HBO has been promoting the episode all season as the one to watch out for. But were the stakes actually all that high? A Stark died, sure. But one we hadn’t seen for several seasons and, even when Rickon was a series regular, we hardly saw him at all. All of our “heroes” who faced battle—Jon, Sansa, Tormund, Melisandre, Davos, Daenerys, Grey Worm, Daario, Yara, Theon, and Tyrion—made it out in one piece. The most upsetting story involving death in the episode belonged to Davos reflecting back on Shireen—a death that happened last season. And the deceptive stakes of “The Battle of the Bastards” are part of a larger problem running through Season 6 of Game of Thrones. As many have noted, a recurring theme of Game of Thrones this season is resurrection and rebirth. That’s a reference to not only the literal resurrection of Jon Snow and the fiery baptism (again) of Daenerys, but also the return of many long-lost characters. But those returns partially exist to feed the body count of the season. Osha, the Blackfish, Balon, and, yes, Rickon all came back just to die after very little screentime. The show is banking on our nostalgia for these characters (well, not you Balon) to up the stakes of their deaths. Yes, it does matter when a Stark dies, but Rickon is hardly on the level of Robb, Cat, or Ned. And while it was incredibly gratifying to watch Sansa have her revenge, the death of Ramsay Bolton feels long past due. Gruesome though it may have been, Ramsay’s death didn’t carry the same satisfaction as the death of King Joffrey or moral murkiness of the murder of Tywin Lannister. Then there were the deaths of famous Season 6 guest stars like Essie Davis, Ian McShane and Max von Sydow who seemed to exist just to put familiar faces on corpses we barely know. We also lost several mascots like Shaggydog, Summer, Wun-Wun, and Hodor. Hodor’s death was expertly executed and certainly poignant but, still, he’s never been a fully-fleshed character. Your mileage may vary when it comes to direwolves, but, with the exception of Ghost, the Stark familiars who are so crucial in the books have had hardly ANY screen time in years. And don’t get me started on the assassination of the Martells. More than anything, the death of Doran and Trystane felt like the show trying to wriggle free of a plot that wasn’t working. Those two deaths had zero emotional impact apart from reminding book readers how much better the Dorne plot was on the page. Perhaps all this hollow-feeling carnage can be traced back to the resurrection of Jon Snow—which still feels like it has no enduring consequences in the world of Game of Thrones. We saw Jon go a bit feral as he nearly beat Ramsay to death, but there’s still no indication that he came back wrong. That seemed linked to Rickon more than anything else. Ditto the (admittedly welcome) return of the Hound. Sandor Clegane also doesn’t die in the books, but don’t all these resurrections make death feel cheap in Westeros when once it was the show’s most famous calling card? Game of Thrones became so popular because anyone could die, especially your favorites. But that wasn’t the case tonight. This lack of mortal consequences for the core cast resulted in one of the most unbelievable moments of the season: the miraculous survival of Arya Stark. There is no way she should have endured all those wounds and lived to parkour about it. But unbelievable survival seems to be the new world order on Game of Thrones. There’s still a chance for Game of Thrones to give us some believably high stakes. The finale promises plenty of carnage at King’s Landing—perhaps even some involving characters we actually care about. There’s also the opportunity for the show to pull back a bit from spectacle. Every episode doesn’t have to have a moment that’s meant to drop jaws while leaving our heroes intact. In my opinion, the quieter moments of “The Battle of the Bastards” were truly the best with the triumphant return of the Stark banners to Winterfell and the scene between Davos and Tormund being definite highlights. But those quieter, dialogue rich moments are becoming rarer and rarer on a show that feels increasingly addicted to spectacle. “The Battle of Bastards” (or the Battle of Ice and Fire, as some prefer to call the episode) was certainly “exciting,” but was it satisfying? I guess that all depends on how much you care about Rickon Stark. ||||| Correction appended: June 20, 2016 In a season during which Game of Thrones has been showing its advanced age, “Battle of the Bastards” proved there’s life in the program yet. Season six has, for this viewer, been a bit of a drag, spending its early going noodling around repetitive plotlines (Daenerys getting into a scrape, again, and then breaking free, again; Arya undergoing yet more of her endless training montage before deciding to scotch the whole thing). But “Battle of the Bastards,” occupying the ninth-episode spot in the season when action traditionally reaches its high point, immediately took its place among some of the show’s very best episodes. Dealing first with the Dany plotline—there’s still, six seasons in, a primal thrill to watching her ride her dragons and incinerate her enemies, and her new alliance with Yara raised new and provocative ideas about female leadership—a state of affairs that has precious few precedents on this show. Her getting Yara to promise to change the behavior of her people, and specifically to end the Ironborn’s tradition of rape, continued a motif of challenging patriarchy that was perhaps the only worthwhile takeaway from her captivity and escape. Maybe the reason Daenerys has historically had far more trouble leading than she does conquering is because she’s been forced by circumstance to deal only with male counterparts, and all their flaws. It’s this level of real insight that adds a bit of necessary bite to the image of the would-be queen soaring and burning. As for the show’s centerpiece, the action at the “Battle of the Bastards” between Jon and Ramsay, it’s among the most beautifully shot work in the show’s history. The sequence of Jon facing down a marauding horde all by himself was striking; what followed, a chaotic mess at which the onetime Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch stood untouched, seemingly invincible like some fur-clad cousin of Neo in The Matrix, was remarkable. The battle had at this point already masterfully used the tools of suspense to manipulate us. Rickon Stark, the brother for whose safety Jon was fighting, was commanded by evil Ramsay to run and evade Ramsay’s arrows; having dodged three that the camera closely followed, he seemed safe until a surprise fourth came out of the blue. Jon was therefore fighting a nihilist’s fight. We knew from a crucial (and well-acted on both sides) conversation with Melisandre that he didn’t want to come back if killed, but it seemed almost not to matter whether he died. That among the show’s most elaborate battle sequences ever—with flying horses and a tragically wounded giant—ended in hand-to-hand combat is one of the episode’s crucial ironies. For all the many, many men were implicated in this battle, it came down to two titanic forces of personality, one of whom, Ramsay, was both unwilling and unable to fight fair. Having shot several arrows at an unarmed Jon, he had no defense against his blows. Without the ability to call the tune, Ramsay, for so long (too long) in this show’s run an almost omnipotent supervillain, was impotent, useless. But it wasn’t Jon who had the last word. It was Sansa, whose planning of the battle proved that she’d become not just a realist but a master strategist. Sansa, who just last season was subject to a brutal (and, rightly, controversial) rape scene, was the one to enact bloody revenge, turning Ramsay’s weapons of war, his voracious hounds, back on him. (There was no reason to believe this would work, given the dogs’ loyalty to their master, but for Ramsay’s overzealous bragging that he’d been starving the animals for a week to ensure their hunger.) This was remarkable given that Sansa has not historically been self-assured like Daenerys—it’s almost hard to remember that she began the series a fantasist, obsessed with love and marriage. As she left, Sansa didn’t look triumphant; murder is something only the cruel would celebrate. But granting the crucial moment of victory and reclamation of Winterfell to a female character, one who’s been subject to so much mistreatment before she came into a surprising destiny, was a victory for the show, at least. It took a story that had been repetitive—both repeating itself and resonating, uninterestingly, with age-old tropes—and spun it forward, granting a moment of power to a new sort of heroine. Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly described the character Jon Snow. He is the former Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. ||||| RIP Ramsay Bolton, enthusiastic sadist, skilled archer and widely resented Warden of the North. The bastard deserved it. To his long list of crimes against humanity – including gutting his own father, gelding Theon and subjecting Sansa Stark to a hateful campaign of mental and physical abuse – we can add animal cruelty. In anticipation of his showdown with Jon Snow in the frosted fields surrounding Winterfell, Ramsay had neglected to feed his hunting hounds for a whole week. He would have done well to remember that every dog has its day. Game of Thrones recap: season six, episode nine – Battle of the Bastards Read more Before the wintry Battle of the Bastards, though, there was the sunnier undercard: dragons v boats, both hurling great balls of fire. With Meereen under bombardment from the massed fleet of the Masters, the first instinct of newly-returned Daenerys seemed to echo audience impatience – why not just command her dragons to annihilate the armada and raze the Masters’ home cities, a useful trial run for any future King’s Landing invasion? Between pyramid-rattling trebuchet impacts, Tyrion managed to convince the Breaker of Chains not to emulate the blitzkrieg tactics of her forebear the Mad King. Instead, she settled for a strategic victory, inducing her scaly WMDs to barbecue one warship so emphatically the rest of the fleet capitulated. That justified a thrilling sequence of unrestrained dragon flambé, while also allowing Daenerys to take possession of some invaluable warships. (Her armada was bolstered even further after some enjoyably flirtatious deal-making with Iron Islands outcast Yara Greyjoy.) Facebook Twitter Pinterest Agonisingly vulnerable … Jon Snow on the battlefield. Photograph: HBO In an episode otherwise light on laughs, there was at least the sly meta-joke that the Battle of the Bastards debuted on Father’s Day. Despite their mirrored status, Jon and Ramsay knew each other only by reputation – their first real encounter, at a chilly pre-battle parlay with Winterfell in sight, seemed to be a win for Ramsay, on points. He parried Jon’s honourable proposal of a one-on-one duel while smirkingly highlighting his superior numbers. Ramsay’s real ace in the hole was Rickon Stark, whose legitimate claim to Winterfell was also his death warrant. Rickon’s last act was to be the stumbling starting gun for the battle proper, skewered by one of Ramsay’s long-distance arrows but only after luring his half-brother into an agonisingly vulnerable position. There have been massed martial clashes on Game of Thrones before, not least season five’s frantic wildling rout at Hardhome, but this was the most visceral and immersive battle yet. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A connoisseur of exquisite cruelty … Ramsay Bolton. Photograph: HBO Amid a chaotic whirlwind of ringing steel and panicked steeds, the camera closely shadowed Jon as he blundered and bodged his way through a nightmarish slurry of blood, mud and freshly-opened guts. Only an eleventh hour cavalry charge by the Knights of the Vale – reinforcements mustered by Littlefinger at Sansa’s request – saved Jon’s ragged forces from being carved up into anonymous sausagemeat inside Ramsay’s murderous ring of steel. Horrible, violent, seemingly arbitrary death is perhaps the one constant in Westeros. Characters, beloved or otherwise, get removed from the board with frightening regularity and little fanfare. Case in point: after heroically breaching Winterfell, not-so-gentle giant Wun Wun, mortally porcupined by Bolton spears, had his moving death scene cut abruptly short by an arrow through the eye. The show sometimes feels like it goes about its murderous business with the faintly bored air of a professional assassin. But for the routed Ramsay, the end came with an unexpected hint of grand guignol that, as a connoisseur of exquisite cruelty, he would probably have admired in slightly different circumstances. At first, it looked like a berserker-raging Jon was going to keep pounding his skull until Ramsay’s brains were splattered across Winterfell’s courtyard. Instead, he found himself roped to a chair for a final encounter with Sansa, who coolly vowed to wipe out every trace of his legacy. If there was still the faintest smirk detectable in that bloody ruin of a face, it melted away when his starved hounds padded in for their delayed feast. For the audience, such a gruesome execution was deeply satisfying – after King Joffrey’s all-too-abrupt choking fit, here was some cosmic comeuppance for a genuinely loathsome villain. But what’s cathartic for fans might not end up being as useful for the Starks. If retaking Winterfell is supposed to be the launchpad for their comeback, they’re off to a morally muddled start. Sansa is also oblivious to the true cost of her actions: Ramsay’s name might eventually be erased from history, but hers will now forever be associated with barking novelty hit Who Let the Dogs Out. ||||| There was a moment during the Battle of the Bastards, where it seemed like Game of Thrones would do what it always did: kill our heroes. Jon Snow was suffocating under a pile of bodies as his army was surrounded and facing certain death. He struggles to the top of the pile, the camera pans out, and with one beautiful shot you see Snow in the center of a pile of dying men. And there's relief, somehow. This might not end in certain tragedy. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Before it even had a name, GoT showrunners have been selling the Battle of the Bastards as the crowning achievement of HBO's hit fantasy series. There was talk of awards. There were reports on the hundreds of extras, hundreds of hours that went into making the final showdown between Jon Snow and that horrible, sadistic asshole Ramsay Bolton. And Game of Thrones delivered—but in the least Game of Thrones way possible. Above anything else, Game of Thrones—as it was staying true to the books written by George R.R. Martin before Season Six—defined itself as a series that broke every traditional fantasy narrative structure. There was no clear protagonist. It hardly, if ever, produced a truly satisfying moment. The big wins on Game of Thrones were always clouded with moral ambiguity and tragedy. Not tonight. Tonight the good guys won. Tonight, as Ramsay was torn apart by his own pack of dogs while Sansa watched her tormenter die a horrible death, as the knights of the Vale charged in to sweep away the rest of House Bolton, the resolve was clear. Game of Thrones has never delivered such a truly satisfying moment. Yes, poor Rickon Stark was killed before the battle. But this was hardly a surprising tragedy, given Ramsay's intentions. This was anti-Game of Thrones. And purists of the books probably wont like it. Some might call it cliche or cheesy or predictable. But, you can't deny that it was satisfying. In a show where fans have endured so much grief, we can at least have this one win. It might not have been typical Game of Thrones, it might not have been the way Martin would have done it, but we'll still always have this: ||||| This post contains spoilers for and frank discussion of Game of Thrones Season 6, Episode 9 “The Battle of the Bastards.” Leave now if you want to avoid spoilers. There’s no denying that this episode was a huge milestone in the evolution of Sansa Stark. But is she evolving in a direction we want to cheer for? Her inexplicable decision not to tell Jon that she had petitioned Littlefinger to deliver the knights of the Vale when she was calling his strategy against Ramsay into question cost hundreds if not thousands of lives. Many Stark men—and possibly Rickon—died because Sansa couldn’t explain to Jon why she wanted him to wait. The point she makes here is a good one. . . . . .but when Jon offers to listen to her—“all right, tell me, what should we do?”—she withholds vital intel. “It’s not enough but it’s all we have,” Jon says of their smallish force. There was your window, Sansa. It’s true that she may not have known for certain at that moment that Littlefinger would answer her call, but telling Jon that the cavalry was possibly on the way (especially when Tormund mentioned how much Ramsay’s horses put them at a disadvantage) would definitely have altered Jon’s approach. The look on Jon’s face here? That’s the look of someone who would have appreciated this news yesterday, Sansa. In a season that’s been all about the Stark kids returning from exile back into the fold of their House, Sansa has decided that the Stark way is not what she’s interested in. Bran and Arya are headed home and Jon is wearing Ned’s clothes, but, as Sansa was the only one to witness, Ned Stark’s way got him killed. When talking to Jon about the battle plans, Sansa is very Baelish in her demeanor. Ignoring the words of her mother’s house—Family. Duty. Honor.—Sansa treats Rickon like a pawn on the chess board. One she has to sacrifice in order to become queen. She’s not wrong. And when Jon nobly puts his Rickon’s life above strategy (just as, surely, Ned would have), we see that the former Lord Commander not only signs Rickon’s life away, but his own death sentence as well. Were it not for Sansa’s Littlefinger-esque gambit, Jon would have died, honorably, just like Ned. But it might not have come to that at all if Jon was working with all the information. The worst interpretation of events is that Sansa keep the Vale knights a secret for leverage and power. I don’t want to believe it of her, but that’s exactly what Littlefinger would have done. And even more distressing than her Baelish tendencies in this episode were the ways Sansa gave into the Bolton influence. “You can’t kill me,” Ramsay smirks at her, “I’m part of you.” No, this isn’t a reference to Sansa possibly being pregnant. It’s Ramsay telling her that he’s molded and tortured her in his own image. And when Sansa executes him just like he prefers to execute others, she proves him right. The little grin as she walks away is about as far away from Ned Stark as Sansa could possibly get. Ned would have swung the sword, not called the attack dogs. (We’ll go ahead and ignore the fact that Sansa rode off before Ramsay said that thing about not feeding his dogs.) But one theme of the episode is characters doing better than their fathers did. (Happy Father’s Day from HBO!) That’s what Daenerys says to Yara, Theon, and Tyrion. By some definitions—in playing the game and surviving—Sansa is doing “better” than her father did. But at what cost? Surely Bran, Jon, and Arya who are trying to cleave closer to House Stark are on a more traditional path for heroic triumph. Could Sansa’s decision to become more like Baelish and Ramsay spell her doom? Or will Game of Thrones subvert all expectations once again? Added Bonus Book Reader Section Events of last week’s episode poured cold water on the long-standing hope that Lady Stoneheart a.k.a. zombie Catelyn Stark would ever make her TV debut. There are some who have speculated that Sansa would take on this role becoming the soulless agent of Starkish vengeance. And, hey, while it might not happen literally, her grim little smiles in the face of so much death and destruction make her seem pretty flinty of heart. It’s not the fate I wanted for Sansa. As much as she deserves vengeance on her tormenters, sacrificing her humanity is not how I’d want her to get there. Catelyn is undead, but Sansa is still alive—for now. Isn’t there a healthier and more humane way for her to triumph. Shouldn’t she get to win and keep some semblance of the person she once was? Do you have what it takes? Test your knowledge of the Seven Kingdoms with Vanity Fair ’s Game of Unknowns. Make your predictions ||||| \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" is big in the way that only Game of Thrones is big. It’s less epic in its scope than, say, season four’s battle between the Night’s Watch and Wildlings, \\"The Watchers on the Wall\\" (an episode I’ve always found a touch overbearing), but compare it to season two’s \\"Blackwater\\" (featuring the battle for King’s Landing) and it's easy to see just how much the show’s scope has increased. Of course, \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" has a leg up on both of those predecessors, because its geography and stakes are 100 percent clear for almost the entire hour. By focusing on a very small battlefield, Game of Thrones is able to give us an episode that captures the chaos of war as well as television ever has. There’s a lengthy unbroken shot (courtesy of director Miguel Sapochnik) of Jon fighting his way across the battlefield, one that underlines just how much of a role sheer luck plays in war. Arrows fly around him but don’t hit him. Swordsman coming to decapitate him are stopped by others. Last-minute saves are the order of the day. And while on the whole, \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" is perhaps a touch overstuffed — I’m not sure the Dany stuff helped the episode, even though I understand why it’s here — it’s still riveting television and an excellent setup for whatever next week’s finale holds. Here are five winners and six losers from the \\"Battle of the Bastards.\\" Winner 1: Jon Snow Well, obviously. Jon doesn’t just win the titular battle. He also effectively wins a battle against the entire dramatic apparatus of the TV show he lives in. In some ways, Ramsay Bolton is Game of Thrones in a nutshell: nasty, brutish, and willing to kill just about anyone. He’s like the heart of the plot turned into a person, cutting his way across the North. Now, anybody who’s read a story before would likely realize that Jon was going to come out on top of this matchup. But by putting a character who’s essentially Game of Thrones incarnate between Jon and victory, the series gave the battle far more weight than it might otherwise have had. But Jon also earned his win. Yeah, he was saved at the last minute by his half-sister and Littlefinger (more on that in a second), but he kept his troops rallied, even when they were surrounded on all sides by men with shields who were slowly killing all of them. \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" takes careful pains to even depict this literally, as Jon is very nearly trampled by his own men before pulling himself to his feet — at which point the tide of the battle starts to turn. All of a sudden, Wun Wun the giant is throwing around some of Ramsay’s forces and Tormund is taking a nice big bite of an enemy’s throat. Yeah, someone else saves the day, but Jon gets everybody to the point where the day can be saved. (Also: The scene where Jon slowly advances on Ramsay as Ramsay fires arrows into his shield is pretty effective small-scale combat. Nice work, everybody!) Winner 2: The Sansa/Littlefinger alliance This might have been the best Game of Thrones episode for Sansa …ever. She gets to deliver all manner of great lines — I’m particularly partial to her dismissal of Jon saying he’ll protect her — and her decision to contact Littlefinger proves the decision point in the whole battle. It’s like her journey in a nutshell: Women in the world of Game of Thrones can’t count on anybody but themselves. The best you can hope for is to convince a man to drag his army across half a continent for you. For his part, Littlefinger now seemingly controls the largest army in the northern half of the Seven Kingdoms, which makes him as much of a force as he’s ever been. Slowly but surely, he’s been working his way up the ladder of power, and he’s as close to the throne as he’s ever gotten before. Maybe with a strategic marriage… Of course, he’ll clearly try to marry Sansa, and the show is — a bit weirdly — playing Sansa and Jon’s scenes as if they’re a romantic couple waiting to happen. (People keep doubting me on this, but seriously, compare their scenes to the way the season two scenes between Talisa and Robb were shot.) So Littlefinger might be hinging much of his plan on someone who won’t be interested in his affections. But for now, he’s riding high. Winner 3: Daenerys and company After Dany returned from her walkabout to find Meereen under siege, I assumed \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" would feature internecine squabbling among her many influential supporting staff members. But, no. Dany pretty much just tells the Masters they can surrender to her, then uses her dragons and the Dothraki who are loyal to her to retake the city. It’s a pretty easy win for Dany, and she quickly strikes an alliance with the Greyjoys as well, neatly wrapping up a plot that, ultimately, didn’t have much meat on its bones. (Euron proves to mostly be a distraction to chase Yara and Theon across the Narrow Sea.) Dany in full conquest mode might be a little terrifying, but she’s fun to watch. One quibble: When Dany looks back at Tyrion to get his blessing for the alliance with the Greyjoys, it plays as a weird moment. I get why the show does it (Tyrion likely knows more about the Greyjoys than Dany does), but it still feels odd that she would so publicly turn to anybody for advice. Winner 4: Theon and Yara Theon and Yara make their way across the Narrow Sea, seemingly without incident, and they strike a deal with Dany, also seemingly without incident. Yes, Dany makes them promise to give up their people’s thieving, pillaging, and raping ways, but that detail will almost certainly be kindly looked upon by future historians. Also, Yara makes a joking proposal of marriage to Dany. All in all, this is the best week for the Greyjoy siblings in quite some time. Winner 5: The people running the show’s campaign for technical Emmys On every level, \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" is a joy to look at. Yes, Emilia Clarke still looks a little weird when she climbs atop one of her dragons (a special effects problem the show seemingly can’t solve), but that’s my only minor quibble. Everything from the effects work to the hushed din of the battle when all seems lost to the camerawork in that impeccable uninterrupted take feels like the show heading out on the open road and hitting the gas. It’s a series that knows exactly what it’s doing at this point, and though I have my problems with the often lazy filmmaking in other episodes, Game of Thrones always brings its A game when it’s time for a giant battle. Game of Thrones is generally an Emmy favorite, and last year, it won the most Emmys for a show in a single year ever, thanks largely to its technical elements. \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" almost singlehandedly assures that it will win many of those technical categories again. Loser 1: Ramsay Bolton (and his hounds) Okay, the hounds get a nice meal (though one that might give them indigestion), but Ramsay ultimately finds himself the final victim of his own sadism. Rather than face trial and execution, he’s gobbled to bits by the beasts he bred to gobble people to bits, which are unleashed upon him by the woman he raped and assaulted endlessly. Ramsay has been a horrible time suck of a character, with the show only able to play one or two notes with him since he debuted. And even in his final moments — when he smiles as Jon beats the hell out of him, as if he’s enjoying it — he gets to be an eye-rolling irritation. But Iwan Rheon was always good in the part, and in these final moments, he did capture some of how Ramsay always felt small in comparison to the seeming giants around him, and how he overcompensated by playing up his own monstrosity. I’m not sad to see Ramsay or the show’s interpretation of him go (indeed, I’m rejoicing), but I hope Rheon uses this to get some great work elsewhere. Loser 2: Wun Wun the giant JUSTICE FOR WUN WUN! (Seriously, though, going the full King Kong with Wun Wun and having him gradually succumb to a bunch of smaller slights, until he toppled over like a gigantic pincushion, worked far better than it should have for a character whose dialogue has been … let’s say, limited.) Loser 3: Rickon Stark Blink and you might miss the neat irony of \\"Battle of the Bastards.\\" Jon talks about how he must use Ramsay’s need to strike fear into the hearts of the Northmen against him. If he can trick Ramsay into being too brash, he can hopefully gain the upper hand, even though he has far fewer fighting men. But Ramsay’s plan similarly uses Jon’s Achilles’ heel against him: his endless reservoirs of loyalty. When Ramsay looses Rickon and tells the boy to run toward his half-brother, it’s clear something terrible will happen. And it immediately does, as Ramsay begins firing arrow after arrow after the youngest Stark brother. Either he lets Rickon live for four shots to draw Jon out far enough, or it takes four shots for Ramsay to finally bring Rickon down (nicely letting the audience think Rickon might escape by really building up the third shot as the one that will end Rickon’s life). But either way, by that time, Jon is way out past his lines, in the middle of nowhere, seemingly about to be ridden down. His own brashness almost costs his forces the fight, and it’s all because of Rickon, a character I literally couldn’t tell you anything about beyond \\"He’s the youngest Stark.\\" RIP, RICKON. (RIP, SHAGGYDOG, TOO.) Loser 4: The Masters I enjoy how casually Dany dispatches of the Masters, first by burning their ships and overwhelming their forces, then by telling them that one of their little trio must die, before killing the two other than the one selected to be killed, hopefully earning herself some degree of fear and/or loyalty. The Masters — to say nothing of the Sons of the Harpy — have always been one of Game of Thrones’ weaker villains. They seem to arrive whenever the plot deems it convenient, and their actions vary from \\"nuisance\\" to \\"city-shattering force.\\" Plus, the series never gave us a recognizable character on their side, so they functioned mostly as a very well-funded terrorist organization. Anyway, they appear to be done for as well. Goodbye, Masters! Loser 5: Euron Greyjoy (by implication) When Theon and Yara show up in Meereen, they pretty much just show up. We don’t even really get an establishing shot of their ships pulling into the harbor or anything similar. We know they’re going to show up at some point, so they just do. To that end, wouldn’t it be sort of amazing if the show similarly dispatched of Euron? Dany clearly isn’t going to listen to his proposal — which contains a literal proposal — so why not just have Drogon noshing on a human leg next week, then have Yara say, \\"Poor Euron!\\" or something similar? Oh, I’m sure we’ll have to have some sort of naval battle. But, again, Euron is such an ill-defined character that whatever happens won’t have the dramatic weight necessary to really hold its own. Loser 6: Fans of both Game of Thrones and the NBA The final game of the NBA Finals and this episode of Game of Thrones — two events you couldn’t safely ignore without somebody randomly popping up outside of your window to shout spoilers at you — aired opposite each other. There hasn’t been such a difficult sports versus pop culture choice since a football game between the then dominant Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers aired opposite one of the final hours of Breaking Bad. (The game was a disappointment. The Breaking Bad was \\"Ozymandias,\\" one of the greatest TV episodes ever made. So.) Anyway, both episode and game ended up being surprisingly compelling, so I guess everybody wins. But in the moment of making that choice, I can see where you might have felt overwhelmed by the bounty of your options. Tell me what you think in comments. I’ll be by to chat about this episode — and any other pop culture topics you want — at noon Eastern And answer my question for you while you’re at it!

Watch: Game of Thrones' time travel, explained ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In the latest episode of Game of Thrones, titled \\"The Battle of the Bastards,\\" audiences were treated to an epic battle between Jon Snow and his northernmen against the Boltons. However, there were some concerns expressed in regards to the direction of certain character developments and the potential loss of moral ambiguity that initially made Game of Thrones stand out from traditional fantasy narratives. Most notably, Sansa Stark's shift in personality towards being more like Baelish and Ramsay and her decision not to inform Jon about the potential arrival of the Knights of the Vale raises questions of whether these changes will lead to her or other characters' eventual doom or further subvert expectations. The episode also featured Daenerys, Grey Worm, Daario, Yara, Theon, and Tyrion battling against the slavers, leading to a partnership between Daenerys and Yara and the defeat of the slavers. Overall, \\"The Battle of Bastards\\" balanced thrilling action sequences and quieter, emotionally charged scenes, providing viewers with a satisfying victory for the Starks."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Manny and Annie were two foodie friends.

On 21 February 1915, Endurance, still held fast, drifted to her most southerly latitude, 76° 58′S. Thereafter she began moving with the pack in a northerly direction. On 24 February, Shackleton realised that they would be held in the ice throughout the winter, and ordered ship's routine abandoned. The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice-kennels or \\"dogloos\\", and the ship's interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men—officers, scientists, engineers, and seamen. A wireless apparatus was rigged, but their location was too remote to receive or transmit signals.Shackleton was aware of the recent example of Wilhelm Filchner's ship, the Deutschland, which had become icebound in the same vicinity three years earlier. After Filchner's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed, his ship Deutschland was trapped on 6 March 1912, about 200 miles (320 km) off the coast of Coats Land. Six months later, at latitude 63° 37', the ship broke free, then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal. Shackleton thought that a similar experience might allow Endurance to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring.In February and March, the rate of drift was very slow. At the end of March Shackleton calculated that the ship had travelled a mere 95 miles (153 km) since 19 January. However, as winter set in the speed of the drift increased, and the condition of the surrounding ice changed. On 14 April, Shackleton recorded the nearby pack \\"piling and rafting against the masses of ice\\"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance \\"she would be crushed like an eggshell\\". In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75° 23′S, 42° 14′W, still drifting northwards.

Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again.

Question: What is the name of Evan's sweetheart? Movie plot title: The Butterfly Effect Movie plot: Growing up, Evan Treborn and his friends, Lenny and siblings Kayleigh and Tommy Miller, suffered many severe psychological traumas that frequently caused Evan to black out. These traumas include being coerced to take part in child pornography by Kayleigh and Tommy's father, George Miller (Eric Stoltz), being nearly strangled to death by his institutionalized father, Jason Treborn (Callum Keith Rennie), who is then killed in front of him by guards; accidentally killing a mother and her infant daughter while playing with dynamite with his friends; and seeing his dog being burned alive by Tommy. Seven years later, while entertaining a girl in his dorm room, Evan discovers that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he can travel back in time and redo parts of his past. His time traveling episodes account for the frequent blackouts he experienced as a child, since those are the moments that his adult self occupied his conscious, such as the moment his father strangled him when he realizes that Evan shares his time-traveling affliction. However, there are consequences to his revised choices that dramatically alter his present life. For example, his personal time-line leads to alternative futures in which he finds himself, variously, as a college student in a fraternity, an inmate imprisoned for murdering Tommy, and a double amputee. Eventually, he realizes that, even though his intentions to fix the past are good, his actions have unforeseen consequences, in which either he or at least one of his friends does not benefit. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternative timelines causes him brain damage and severe nosebleeds. He ultimately reaches the conclusion that he and his friends will never have good futures as long as he keeps trying to fix the past, and he realizes that the only thing keeping his friends from having good lives is himself.

Act 1: Richard Bone, a struggling journalist, receives a tip about corruption within the city's high society. Eager to crack the story, Richard begins his late-night investigation. While driving through the city, an unexpected heavy rainstorm begins, causing Richard's car to break down in a dimly-lit alley. Act 2: As Richard attempts to fix his car, he hears a blood-curdling scream coming from a nearby building. Curiosity gets the better of him, and he decides to investigate. He comes across the body of a young woman who seems to be the victim of a brutal crime. Richard quickly gathers evidence, suspecting that someone from the city's elite is involved. As Richard delves deeper into the investigation, he finds people from the high society who are willing to share information, albeit discreetly. Among them is Elizabeth, a wealthy socialite who is desperate to expose the dark side of her social circle. Act 3: Richard and Elizabeth uncover a pattern of mysterious disappearances among the city's young women, ultimately leading them to a secret society that uses violence and intimidation to maintain their control over the city's political and financial systems. As they get closer to uncovering the truth, the clandestine organization begins to target Richard and Elizabeth, forcing them to fight for their lives. During their investigation, it is revealed that the alley where Richard's car broke down is a crucial location in the secret society's operations. It serves as an unassuming drop-off point for their victims, and the rainstorm that night disrupted the organization's plans, unintentionally placing Richard at the scene of the crime. Act 4: Determined to bring the secret society to justice, Richard and Elizabeth devise a risky plan to expose their criminal activities. Leveraging their newfound allies and their investigative skills, they rally public support and force law enforcement to take decisive action against the secret society's leaders. In the final confrontation, Richard and Elizabeth successfully dismantle the organization, bringing an end to their reign of terror within the city and restoring justice. As the dust settles, the two find solace in each other and decide to continue working together in their quest for exposing the truth hidden within the shadows of society.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and...

Castro toppled the government in 1959, introducing a Communist revolution. He defied the US for decades, surviving many assassination plots. His supporters said he had given Cuba back to the people. Critics saw him as a dictator. Live updates A hero and a tyrant - obituary His life in pictures A revolutionary at home and abroad Ashen and grave, President Castro told the nation in an unexpected late night broadcast on state television that Fidel Castro had died and would be cremated later on Saturday. \\"The commander in chief of the Cuban revolution died at 22:29 hours this evening (03:29 GMT Saturday),\\" he said. \\"Towards victory, always!\\" he added, using a revolutionary slogan. A period of official mourning has been declared on the island until 4 December, when his ashes will be laid to rest in the south-eastern city of Santiago. Barring the occasional newspaper column, Fidel Castro had essentially been retired from political life for several years. In April, Fidel Castro gave a rare speech on the final day of the country's Communist Party congress. \\"I'll soon be 90,\\" the former president said, adding that this was \\"something I'd never imagined\\". \\"Soon I'll be like all the others,\\" Fidel Castro said, suggesting his \\"turn\\" to pass away was coming. Castro was the longest serving non-royal leader of the 20th Century. He temporarily handed over power to his brother in 2006 as he was recovering from an acute intestinal ailment. Raul Castro officially became president two years later. News of his death left some in Havana stunned. \\"I always said it couldn't be,\\" said one woman, a government employee. \\"Even though they said it now, I say it can't be.\\" Throughout the Cold War, Fidel Castro was a thorn in Washington's side. An accomplished tactician on the battlefield, he and his small army of guerrillas overthrew the military leader Fulgencio Batista in 1959 to widespread popular support. Within two years of taking power, he declared the revolution to be Marxist-Leninist in nature and allied the island nation firmly to the Soviet Union. Despite the constant threat of a US invasion as well as the long-standing economic embargo on the island, Castro managed to maintain a communist revolution in a nation just 90 miles (145km) off the coast of Florida. Despised by his critics as much as he was revered by his followers, he maintained his rule through 10 US presidents and survived scores of attempts on his life by the CIA. He established a one-party state, with hundreds of supporters of the Batista government executed. Political opponents have been imprisoned, the independent media suppressed. Thousands of Cubans have fled into exile. Latin American leaders have been quick to pay tribute. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said Castro was a \\"great friend\\" of Mexico, while to El Salvador's President Salvador Sanchez Ceren he was an \\"eternal companion\\". Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said \\"revolutionaries of the world must follow his legacy\\". 80 rebels landed with him on Cuba to launch the revolution 32 was his age when he came to power, toppling Fulgencio Batista 49 years as Cuban president, a record for a non-royal leader 638 assassination attempts he reportedly survived The Soviet Union's last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, said: \\"Fidel stood up and strengthened his country during the harshest American blockade, when there was colossal pressure on him.\\" Russian President Vladimir Putin described him as a \\"reliable and sincere friend\\" of Russia, while Chinese President Xi Jinping said \\"Comrade Castro will live forever\\". For French President Francois Hollande, Castro embodied Cuba's revolution in both its \\"hopes\\" and its later \\"disappointments\\". Pope Francis, who met Castro, an atheist, when he visited Cuba in 2015, called his death \\"sad news\\" and sent \\"sentiments of grief\\". From US President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened to reverse his predecessor's work to build ties with Cuba, came a brief tweet exclaiming the news: In Miami, where there is a large Cuban community, there have been celebrations in some parts of the city, with people banging pots and cheering. A Cuban exile group, the Cuban Democratic Directorate, said Castro left \\"legacy of intolerance\\" and had set up a \\"vicious totalitarian regime\\". Divisive legacy captivates world media UK opposition: Castro 'huge figure' Although the announcement of Fidel Castro's death caught many Cubans unawares, it can't be said that they weren't partly expecting it. In a sense, they have been preparing for this moment, a post-Fidel Cuba, for several years now as he retired from public life and largely disappeared from view. But now that it has actually arrived, some are asking whether it will make any political different to Cuba's trajectory. It's unlikely to, mainly because Raul Castro has already been implementing economic changes intended to attract foreign direct investment and ease the tight restrictions on ordinary Cubans. Plus, of course, there is the new rapprochement with Washington. While it's still not clear what a Trump presidency will mean in that regard, those changes are unlikely to be reversed because of Castro's death. Nor will Cuba change its one-party political system in his absence. Politically, his legacy lives on.

Plot: Act 1: Bugs Bunny is digging through the ground in search of his favorite treat (carrots, of course) when he inadvertently digs into a hidden underground chamber housing an ancient alien spacecraft. Astonished, Bugs stumbles into the saucer and accidentally activates it, causing the ship's sophisticated AI, \\"CARO-T,\\" to wake up from a long hibernation. CARO-T informs Bugs that the saucer has traveled 3 billion miles and was part of a reconnaissance mission millions of years ago to find a hospitable planet for its creators, the \\"Vegalons.\\" During CARO-T's millennia-long sleep, the Vegalons' home planet was dying, and they had been searching for a new world with signs of intelligent life to call home. Act 2: CARO-T receives an urgent transmission from the Vegalons, who have finally found their way to Earth. Realizing the dire situation, the Vegalons inform CARO-T that they have a device capable of teleporting their entire civilization to Earth. Unfortunately, activating this device would be catastrophic for humans, leading to Earth's destruction. Despite their peaceful intentions, the Vegalons have no other option, and Bugs decides to help them find a more suitable planet to save both species. With CARO-T's guidance, Bugs pilots the saucer, zipping through the galaxy at breakneck speed, visiting various planets, and encountering several strange alien creatures, some friendly, some hostile. During these adventures, Bugs and CARO-T develop an unbreakable friendship. Act 3: After several close calls, Bugs finally learns the importance of cooperation and teamwork. Together, they discover an ideal, uninhabited planet adjacent to the Vegalons' dying world. At first, the Vegalons are reluctant to trust Bugs, but through Bugs' quick wit and charm, he convinces them to try out the new planet. The Vegalons successfully teleport their civilization to the new planet, dubbing it \\"Planet Carotene,\\" in honor of their new hare friend and the AI that saved them. As a token of gratitude, they provide Bugs with the means to instantly return to Earth. With Earth safe and now having become a hero to two species, Bugs Bunny returns home, excited to share his out-of-this-world experience.

My main goal was to relax in preparation for the challenges of my retirement in the coming year. Through my stay in Montreal, I met lots of Chinese who are struggling to succeed and then lead a better life in Canada. Some travelled thousands of miles to get knowledge. When I spoke with some of them about the major barrier they had to face after they arrived in Canada, they all talked about the two official languages of Canada. But I was impressed by their ability to express their ideas while switching between English and French. Almost all of those people said they often felt homesick. They miss their families and friends. Though Montreal has lots of Chinese restaurants, they long for a home-cooked meal. I met some tourists who were trying to realize their childhood dreams of experiencing the life in a developed country. When I asked them if Montreal had lived up to their expectations, they hesitated. They said that reality never agrees with fantasies. However, they were glad to have the opportunity to visit Montreal and didn't regret taking the trip. Not all the Chinese people I met were happy. I once met a young lady who met with a gentleman through the Internet. However, to her disappointment, he disappeared after he promised to marry her in Montreal. I was served by another Chinese person who could not handle the challenges of studying in an English environment and ended up working in a restaurant with minimum pay. Exploring different parts of the world, without any doubt, is an enriching experience. However, one should be realistic when it comes to leaving his hometown to set up a new life in a foreign country. One should take the time to examine the advantages and the shortcomings of the venture before they decide to chase an uncertain dream of achieving success or leading a better life.

Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to understand why. Premise: \\"And there are other possibilities.\\" This statement suggests that there exist multiple potential outcomes or options to consider for a given scenario. The use of the word \\"other\\" implies that this is in addition to at least one known possibility. For instance, if we were discussing different ways to solve a problem, the premise would be acknowledging that numerous solutions exist.

MacGill made his Test debut in 1998, and over the years, he built a reputation for his effective spin bowling techniques and sportsmanship on the field. The Australian cricketer's decision to quit Test cricket came after the rain-interrupted third day of the second Test, during which he managed to secure the only wicket to fall. Despite having a fruitful career as a spin bowler, MacGill's journey has not been without challenges. Playing on a team that already had spin sensation Shane Warne meant that MacGill often had to compete with him for a spot in the team.

During the rain-interrupted third day of the second Test, MacGill performed admirably as always, proving his prowess as an exceptional spinner.

Find the appropriate Russian words/phrases for each element: - \\"it\\" = \\"онo\\" (for neuter gender nouns, assuming we're talking about a place, e.g. a hotel or apartment) - \\"offers\\" = \\"предлагает\\" - \\"a private terrace\\" = \\"частная терраса\\" (note that in Russian, the adjective \\"private\\" comes before the noun \\"terrace\\") - \\"with\\" = \\"с\\" - \\"fantastic views\\" = \\"фантастическим видом\\" (here, I use the instrumental case for \\"views\\" since it follows the preposition \\"with\\" in the sentence, and the adjective \\"fantastic\\" should be in agreement with the noun's case and gender) - \\"of the sea\\" = \\"на море\\" 3.

Does it follow that \\"As the per capita income increases, we change to account for predicted alterations in WTP as time goes on.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"As the per capita income increases, we change to account for predicted alterations in WTP as time goes on\\" is essentially a paraphrase of the original sentence. Both statements convey the same idea: that adjustments are made to consider the expected fluctuations in willingness to pay (WTP) as a consequence of increasing per capita income over time. Willingness to pay (WTP) is a crucial concept in economics, as it represents the maximum amount a consumer is willing to spend on a good or service. As per capita income increases, it is normal for individuals to have more disposable income, thereby making them more likely to spend on goods and services. Consequently, businesses and policymakers need to accommodate these expected changes in WTP when making plans and decisions. This can manifest in various forms. For instance, businesses could reevaluate their product pricing strategies, offering different products or services to cater to varying income levels. In this scenario, businesses might want to introduce premium versions of their products or services to attract consumers with a higher WTP. Alternatively, they could provide additional features or improved customer service to enhance the value of their offerings. From the policymaker's perspective, accounting for WTP fluctuations with the rise in per capita income could involve reassessing tax policies or designing programs targeted at different income groups. For example, they could adjust tax brackets to ensure fair taxation based on an individual's ability to pay or develop social programs to encourage economic growth and provide support to those with lower incomes. In conclusion, both statements emphasize the importance of adapting to anticipated changes in willingness to pay over time as per capita income increases. As societies evolve, it is essential for businesses and policymakers to consider these changes to ensure that they continue to satisfy consumer demands and promote economic stability."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does an earthworm eat & digests food.

The complete answer should include the following information: An earthworm’s food consumption process begins with ingesting soil through its mouth, which contains organic matter. The food travels through the pharynx, where it is lubricated by mucus and then moves to the esophagus. In the gizzard, the soil and organic matter are ground up with the help of the strong muscles and bits of small stones. Then it moves to the intestines, where digestive enzymes and gastric juice break down the organic matter further for digestion.

Article: Dear editor, Several days ago, I heard that a dear friend of mine had killed herself. I was deep in sorrow by the sudden news. I can't keep calm any longer. I'm always thinking about life and death. Life is so precious. If we can slip into death in an impulsive moment, what use in all our efforts and hopes? Our families, our ambitions, everything is flung into total darkness. And death allows no time for regret. Nevertheless, the suicide rate increases year by year, particularly of young people. Reasons may vary from person to person, yet I think they share something in common. First, today's young people are morally weak. They hunger for success but can not face failure; they are eager to be understood but afraid of opening their hearts to others. They live in a wide world, from east to west, ancient to present, but their hearts beat in a narrow desert, closed tight, unable to communicate. Each becomes an isolated fortress , lonely, and weak. My friend is a good example of that. As a young teacher, she was devoted to her work but was disappointed with her students' occasional failures. She fell in love with a colleague but he deserted her. With no close friends, disappointed at work and in love, death seemed to her the only remaining choice and she took it. Another reason for the weakness of today's youth, in my opinion, comes from society's pressures. The young are forced to try too hard to succeed. On the other hand, society refuses to accept that children sometimes do fail. But failure is more important because it can teach the young how to win next time. What can we do to save the desperate young? Question: Among the following, which one is NOT the cause of \\"my friend's death\\"? Options: A: She has too much society's pressure.

Finally, you fell in love. She, now your wife, is not a dog person, but I still welcomed her into our home. I was happy because you were happy. Then the human babies came along and I shared your excitement, I was attracted by their pinkness, how they smelled, and I wanted to mother them too. Your wife was afraid I would bite them.

In fact a good examination system should train a student to think for himself. But it now does nothing about that. So students are encouraged to member what is taught. It does not enable them to gain more and note knowledge. The students who come out first in the examination often may not be the best in their studies. Besides, the examinations often force teachers to train students what to do with the coming examination from time to time. There must be some simpler and better way to test a student' s ability besides knowledge. And that is what we should do at once.

How do they do it so well? Question 2: What is the hardest thing(s) about raising children in Lesotho? OPT: (i) no. (ii) yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: What books best depict the culture of Lesotho? How do they do it so well? There are several books and literary works that depict the culture, history, and lifestyle of the people of Lesotho. Some notable titles include: 1. \\"Chaka\\" by Thomas Mofolo: Although this novel is primarily about the life of the Zulu King, Chaka, it provides a vivid portrayal of the Southern African region, of which Lesotho is a part. Mofolo, a Lesotho native, skillfully weaves in elements of the Basotho culture in his narrative. 2. \\"Blankets of Summer\\" by Zakes Mda: This novel provides an account of the traditional ways of Lesotho's villages and their inherent struggles. Mda's writing captures the simplicity of rural life and highlights the socio-political and cultural aspects that affect the Basotho people. 3. \\"Mother, Sing for Me\\" by Doris Lessing: Through stories and memories of her childhood in Zimbabwe, Lessing describes the cultural relationship between the people of Lesotho and their environment. Her work also explores the impact of European influence on the indigenous customs of the region. 4. \\"The Mantle of the Mountain: Love, Life and Livelihood in Lesotho\\" by Kevin Michael Volpp: This work offers an intimate portrayal of life in the highlands of Lesotho and helps readers understand the real-life challenges faced by the people in this region. The book provides valuable insights into the dynamics of traditional and modern Lesotho society. These books depict Lesotho culture so well because they delve into the intricacies of local customs, language, and traditions while also addressing the challenges faced by the people. The authors' vivid descriptions and storytelling not only provide an engaging reading experience but also make the readers feel connected to the lives and culture of the Basotho people. Question 2: What is the hardest thing(s) about raising children in Lesotho? Raising children in Lesotho can be challenging due to a combination of socio-economic factors and environmental conditions. Some of the hardest aspects of raising children in this country include: 1. Poverty: Lesotho has a high poverty rate, which can make it difficult for parents to provide basic necessities such as food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare for their children. The economic constraints often force children to engage in labor, depriving them of their right to education and a nurturing childhood. 2. Limited access to education: Many families in rural areas of Lesotho are far from schools, making it difficult for children to access formal education. In addition, the lack of resources and inadequate infrastructure in schools affects the quality of education received by children. 3. Health and nutrition challenges: With high rates of malnutrition and food insecurity, many children in Lesotho suffer from health issues. Furthermore, the country has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, and many children are either infected or orphaned by the disease. 4. Cultural practices: In some Lesotho communities, traditional practices such as early marriages and initiation rites involving genital cutting can have a negative impact on the physical and emotional well-being of children. 5. Environmental challenges: Lesotho is a mountainous country, which makes it susceptible to harsh weather conditions such as extreme cold, flooding, and droughts. These conditions can worsen living conditions and endanger children's health. Overall, these questions are not asking the same thing. Question 1 focuses on the literature depicting the culture of Lesotho, while Question 2 centers on the challenges in raising children within the country."},{"instruction":"Question: Which town do the New Jersey Devils hockey team play?

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.

The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

B). medications were usually not enough. Complete the following sentence. Lexi used her paychecks to get her medications, but the","output":"B). medications were usually not enough. Lexi used her paychecks to get her medications, but the medications were usually not enough. As a result, Lexi constantly struggled to find a balance between managing her financial resources and maintaining her health. The high cost of medications, coupled with the inconvenient fact that her insurance did not cover all of the necessary treatments and prescriptions, left Lexi in a precarious position. Furthermore, the medications she could afford to purchase with her paychecks often had to be prioritized based on their immediate necessity. This meant that some preventative medications or long-term treatments had to take a backseat to more pressing needs such as pain management or essential medication for chronic conditions. Consequently, Lexi's overall health and well-being suffered due to the accumulated impact of insufficient medication, leading to a cycle of stress, exacerbation of existing conditions, and a continuous juggling act with her finances. The stark reality of Lexi's situation also took a toll on her mental health. The daily hurdle of acquiring her needed medications and the stress of being unable to afford a comprehensive treatment plan negatively affected her outlook on life, wellbeing, and self-esteem. It became increasingly challenging for Lexi to remain hopeful and confident in her own ability to navigate the healthcare system and secure the proper care she deserved. Compounding Lexi's predicament was the fact that paychecks from her job often saw delays or came in inconsistent intervals. This was due to the unpredictability of her work hours or challenges associated with being a part of the gig economy. Even when Lexi was able to secure additional sources of income to patch together a more comprehensive healthcare strategy, there were very few occasions when she had the financial security to maintain it. In the face of her own financial and medical struggles, Lexi found herself advocating for better access to affordable healthcare and medications for herself, her loved ones, and others in similar circumstances. This involved researching resources, joining online communities, and attending neighborhood gatherings where she could find and share valuable information to help improve access to much-needed care. Sadly, Lexi's story is not unique in today's world. Many people find themselves in a similar position, with paychecks insufficiently meeting their healthcare needs and medications being too expensive to afford. The plight of individuals like Lexi further underscores the importance of re-evaluating and re-structuring our healthcare systems to address these inequitable discrepancies and provide the required support to maintain the health and well-being of individuals across all socioeconomic backgrounds."},{"instruction":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: How does Brandon die? a cannibal bludgeons him to death with a crude club Answer:","output":"Title: The Feast of the Forbidden Step 1: Introduce Brandon and his group of friends The movie opens with Brandon and a group of his friends (Rachel, Luke, and Sophia) planning a hiking trip in a remote, dense forest. They're excited to explore the uncharted territory and uncover hidden mysteries. This helps establish Brandon's adventurous and curious nature. Step 2: Setup the remote setting As the group starts their journey, Rachel, an amateur historian, reveals stories about the forest's ancient beliefs and legends. Rumors of a tribe that practices cannibalism are recounted around a campfire, intriguing the friends and creating an eerie ambience. The lush landscape of the forest is contrasted with its dark legends, making the setting more mysterious. Step 3: Introduce the tribe and the forbidden area While exploring further, the group comes across a nearly hidden, overgrown path, which leads to a strange symbol on a tree. Luke, who is well-versed in indigenous cultures, explains that the symbol is a warning sign to stay away from forbidden territory. Curiosity gets the better of Brandon and Sophia, who decide to venture ahead, though Rachel and Luke initially hesitate. Step 4: Brandon and Sophia encounter the cannibals As Brandon and Sophia tread further into the forest, they unknowingly enter the cannibal tribe's territory. The tribe, whose existence has remained hidden for centuries, finds the pair in their sacred grounds, and captures them for trespassing. Meanwhile, Rachel and Luke realize the potential danger their friends are in, and decide to follow them into the forbidden area.

See options at the end The man bought the carnations instead of the roses because the OPT: [a]. carnations were very dull. [b]. roses were very dull.","output":"The man bought the carnations instead of the roses because the roses were very dull. It is important to examine the context and reasoning of the man's decision to make this choice. Roses are often considered the quintessential choice when it comes to flowers for special occasions, particularly for romantic gestures or as an expression of love. However, the man in this situation decided to steer clear of the conventional path and opt for carnations instead. This decision was rooted in the fact that the roses available were not up to the standard or aesthetic appeal that he was looking for. Dull roses may signify that they are either wilting or have lost their vibrant color. In either case, the roses would not have the same visual impact that fresh, brightly colored flowers would bring. Purchasing dull roses could also negatively impact the overall presentation of the bouquet and may not properly convey the emotions or messages that the man hopes to communicate. On the other hand, carnations are a popular alternative to roses. While they are often less expensive, they are no less significant when it comes to their versatility and appearance. Carnations come in a variety of colors, making them well-loved for their ability to suit a wide range of occasions and sentiments. Furthermore, carnations tend to have a longer shelf life and maintain their freshness longer than roses. This durability is another factor that may have influenced the man's decision to choose carnations instead of the dull roses. Not only did the man consider the aesthetic appeal of the carnations, but he may have also taken into account that the recipient of the bouquet might appreciate an unconventional choice. By opting for carnations, the man distinguishes himself from others who default to roses. This deviation from the norm, together with the freshness and vibrancy of the carnations, sends a strong message that the man has put careful thought into his choice. In conclusion, the man bought the carnations instead of the roses because the roses were very dull. This decision was influenced by the lackluster appearance of the roses and the man's desire to present a vibrant and visually appealing bouquet. Carnations offered a unique and versatile alternative that not only lasts longer but also demonstrates the care and thoughtfulness that went into selecting the perfect flowers for the occasion."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to exercise safely when you have angina Talk to your doctor.
