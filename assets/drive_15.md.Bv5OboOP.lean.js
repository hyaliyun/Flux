It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel.

Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and Prof. Etienne Lafarge (Nestor Paiva) expose a stone tablet. They take it back to their tent to clean and examine it. We are introduced to Dr. Jud Bellamin (Hugh Beaumont) and Dr. Paul Stuart (Phil Chambers) who ask Bentley to translate the find: it may be related to the story of Gilgamesh and Ishtar. An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley. He cleans it and it is revealed to be an ancient oil lamp. The inscription is translated as a pre-biblical Noah's Ark story. The party of scientists set off for the mountain where the artifact originated before it was dislodged by the earthquake.They set up base camp and plan their final assault on the mountain the next day. A storm hits the base camp that evening. As they set off the next morning an avalanche brings down an arm from a statue.

There are recorded cases of people expressing caution or nervousness when it comes to this specific date. Step 3: Assessing the factual nature of the statement The statement claims that some people (not all) are wary of bad luck and danger on Friday the 13th. Given that superstitions and beliefs about this date are widespread, it can be deduced that there are at least some people who feel this way.

However, the phrasing of the question implies that only one answer is expected; specifically asking \\"What\\" has a nervous system rather than \\"Which have\\" nervous systems. In comparison, jellyfish have a more unique and simple nervous system, making them a more distinctive answer. - (E) The cardiovascular system is an internal body system found in organisms with a closed circulatory system, but it is not an organism itself with a nervous system. - (F) Animals is a valid response, as all animals have nervous systems.

A taper candle works best, but any candle can work. Then, pour water into the bowl until the candle is almost covered. Leave about 1 in (2.5 cm) of candle sticking out of the water for the spell. It's best to use a black candle, if you have one. You can find a black taper candle at a department store, magickal supplies store, or online. Pour salt into your hand, then slowly sprinkle it in a circle around the candle. Add as much salt as you like to provide extra purification to your spell. You can use table salt for this, but it’s best to use sea salt or Epsom salt if you have it. They haven’t been processed like table salt, so their properties are more intact. a white light flowing into the water. Stare at the bowl of water and picture a beam of white light flowing into the bowl. Imagine that this light is a positive, cleansing light. Take several slow, deep breaths as you visualize the light. In Pagan traditions, the purpose of this practice is to imbue the water with positive energy to help your spell work. Use a match or lighter to light the candle. As it burns, recite a spell or say a prayer to break your curse. Make sure you finish your spell before the candle goes out. You might say, “Earth, fire, water, and air, be the answer to my prayer, banish this curse and leave me pure, tonight I claim a blessed cure.” You could pray, “Dear God/Goddess, Please cleanse me of this negative energy and lift the curse. I know that you will make me free. Amen.” Don’t blow out your candle because it’s best to let it go out on its own. Let the candle continue burning until the wick reaches the water. At that point, the water will extinguish the fire. Your spell is almost complete! In Pagan traditions, it's believed that letting a candle go out on its own strengthens the spell and keeps the magic in place. Remove the candle from the water and bend it at the center. Keep bending until it breaks in half. Then, take the bowl and the candle outside. Dig a shallow hole and bury your candle. Burying the candle completes the spell to break the curse. Slowly pour the water so that you’re able to complete an entire circle. If you still have water, make another pass. You do this to seal the spell. The salt may kill grass around the buried candle.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who is father of Alexander? Movie title: Fanny and Alexander Movie plot: This is essentially a four act play. In the first act we meet the Ekdahl family -- large, joyous, prosperous. Then Oscar (Allan Edwall), father of Alexander (Bertil Guve) who might be 11 and Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) who might be 7, dies.In act two, Oscar appears to his children. Alexander asks why he doesn't go off to Heaven. Oscar replies that he doesn't want to leave those he lived with. The children's mother remarries in less than a year, going to a strict Bishop Edvard Vergerus' (Jan Malmsjö) house with none of her furniture, none of the children's toys, and an optimism that she can make a good thing of it despite his powerfully controlling personality. Alexander learns from the ghost of the Bishop's first wife that she and her children died trying to escape after having been locked up for days. They climbed out a window but failed to make it across the cold fast-flowing stream that separates the back of the house from the town. Alexander tells this to a servant who repeats it to the Bishop. The Bishop must discredit this story, and demands retraction. Then he locks up the boy.In act three, Isak (Erland Josephson), a family friend, arrives at the house, ostensibly to buy a chest, but actually to smuggle the children out of the house (in the chest!). During this escape, the ghosts of his former family appear to the Bishop. The children are kept for the moment in Isak's house, where Alexander meets Ismael Retzinsky (Stina Ekblad) whose paranormal abilities help Alexander start a fire in the Bishop's house, a fire that is fatal to the hated step-father.In the final act, mother (Ewa Fröling) and children are back in the warm comfort of their extended family's house. Gustav (Jarl Kulle), the late Oscar's brother, gives a toast in which he summarizes the play. Without mentioning ghosts explicitly, he says there are things we know and should enjoy, such as food and dance, and many more aspects of life of which we are ignorant.

Dr Gary Weinstein worked alongside 26-year-old Miss Pham to treat Mr Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28. He said his colleague was petrified when she realised she had been infected with the deadly virus, saying: 'She risked her life to care for a patient, and now she was afraid for her life.' But he added: 'I think once she got over the initial fear and concern and was surrounded by her friends and colleagues, that was comforting. She did remarkably well, emotionally.' Scroll down for videos. Doctor: Dr Gary Weinstein today described the moment his colleague Nina Pham, 26, learned she had contracted Ebola after caring for victim Thomas Eric Duncan in hospital, saying: 'She was scared' Victim: Dr Weinstein worked alongside Miss Pham (pictured, left, and, right, in hospital after her diagnosis) to treat Mr Duncan, a Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28. Miss Pham, who suffered from a fever with a temperature of above 100.5 degrees prior to her devastating diagnosis, is now in a 'fair' condition at a National Institutes of Health isolation unit. She is one of two nurses to have developed Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who died on October 8. The second worker, Amber Vinson, 29, was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday. She was later airlifted to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia on a specialized plane with a quarantine unit. Speaking to WFAA-TV, Dr Weinstein insisted the two nurses - along with the rest of the team - had followed CDC guidelines, which, at the time, did not include the use of a full respiratory mask. When asked why Miss Pham and Miss Vinson caught Ebola, he said: 'I think that these two nurses took care of a critically-ill patient at a time when he was not in control of his body fluids. 'And at a time when the recommendations from the CDC (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention) that we were following did not include the full respiratory mask.' Bedridden: Dr Weinstein, who was captured on video earlier this week telling a bedridden Miss Pham not to cry (pictured), said his colleague was petrified when she realised she had been infected with the virus. Comforting: The doctor, who was behind the camera, told the brave nurse: 'Well, happy tears are okay' Hospital: During the converstion, Dr Weinsten insisted Miss Pham - along with the rest of the team at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital (pictured) - had followed CDC guidelines during their care of Mr Duncan. His comments are in stark contrast to the CDC's claims that a 'breach of protocol' must have taken place to enable the infection to spread through the two nurses' protective gear. The center is currently preparing to issue new guidelines on protective gear to safeguard the well-being of doctors and nurses who are caring for Ebola patients. During the conversation, Dr Weinstei said despite knowing of Mr Duncan's contagious condition, both Miss Vinson and Miss Pham volunteered to look after him, joining an 'amazing' medical team. 'It's been so heartwarming. This kind of illness, this process that we've been through, this is the essence of nursing. This is the epitome of health care,' he said. Another patient: Miss Pham is one of two nurses to have developed Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who died on October 8. The second, Amber Vinson (pictured) was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday. Transfer: She was later airlifted to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia on a specialized plane. The doctor, who was captured on video earlier this week telling a bedridden Miss Pham not to cry - unless they were 'happy tears'' - gave the nurse a hug in his hazmat suit following her diagnosis. He told the news station that Mr Duncan's death 10 days ago was 'very, very quick', saying: 'He was critically ill and unstable, and over a period of minutes, he lost his pulse and was dead,' He also revealed that, in terms of Ebola, he considered himself to be 'no risk', despite having spent days caring for all three victims of the disease at the Dallas-based hospital. He said this was because Mr Duncan's bodily fluids were being controlled by the time he started caring for him, and he has worn a respiratory mask in the presence of all three patients. Tragic: Dr Weinstein said he considered himself 'no risk' because Mr Duncan's (pictured) bodily fluids were being controlled by the time he started caring for him, and he has worn a respiratory mask at all times. 'My only interactions with any of these patients have been in completely covered respirators, no skin showing to the outside world,' said Dr Weinstein. 'I think I'm no risk.' However, he revealed he has been asked by officials to avoid public places and public transport, and to take his temperature on a daily basis. According to the latest figures, the Ebola death toll has now struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Outbreak: It comes as the Ebola death toll has struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Above, a health worker carries a baby to an Ebola holding center. Most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, all in West Africa. Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said. Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the affected person's bodily fluids.

This conclusion is drawn from a combination of the specific words and phrases used, as well as the overall context of the message. First, the tweet begins with \\"Hahahahaha,\\" which is an expression of laughter. This suggests that the tweet's author found something amusing, further indicating a positive sentiment. The presence of laughter also connotes a relaxed and informal atmosphere, setting the stage for the rest of the message. Next, the phrase \\"i love\\" clearly communicates a positive feeling, as the word \\"love\\" denotes affection and fondness for something or someone. In this case, it seems that the tweet's author is referring to the person they are mentioning, \\"katieluckylegs\\". Moreover, the phrase \\"your drunk ass\\" may initially be seen as a negative or derogatory remark from a conventional standpoint. However, when taking the whole tweet into context, it is more likely to be an affectionate and playful tease directed towards the mentioned person. The word \\"drunk\\" indicates that the subject of the tweet is probably under the influence of alcohol, and the usage of the word \\"ass\\" can be colloquial slang to refer to a person informally. Therefore, it is fair to assume that the tweet is meant to poke fun at a close friend's intoxicated state in a light-hearted and non-malicious manner. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as positive, jovial, and humorous, reflecting the tweet author's enjoyment and affection towards their friend's amusing behavior while intoxicated. This interpretation takes into account the language, expressions, and overall context of the message, leading to a comprehensive understanding of its sentiment."},{"instruction":"Planet X had two large oceans. Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases? Hint: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts. The answer to this question is:","output":"Ice Ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. This is because Ice Ocean had fewer submarine volcanoes compared to Tropical Ocean, which had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. The higher number of volcanoes in Tropical Ocean would release more volcanic gases and cause a higher degree of water discoloration. Since Ice Ocean had fewer submarine volcanoes, the volcanic gases released would be comparatively less, resulting in less discoloration of water."},{"instruction":"Given the question: After disbelieving Kendall's claims of medical unfitness, Austin sent Kendall off to the war.

If a recipe calls for dicing, mincing, or slicing ingredients, for instance, do all of the prep work first so you can start making the food. If you already feel comfortable doing prep work while you cook food, read through the recipe to see when to do specific prep. For example, if you're caramelizing onions, they'll probably take a long time. Get them cooking and then prep the rest of the ingredients while they're caramelizing. Instead of roasting large chunks of vegetables or boiling entire potatoes, chop them into smaller pieces than you usually do. Vegetables that are 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) in size will cook much faster than 2 to 3 in (51 to 76 mm) pieces. If you're really short on time, try dicing or grating the food. For example, instead of cooking chunks of home fries, grate the potatoes to make hashbrowns. You can even cut meat and seafood into smaller pieces. Slice a large roast or fillet into smaller and thinner pieces to cut down on cooking time. A lot of cooking and baking recipes direct you to use softened butter instead of cold butter from the fridge or freezer. Although you could warm the butter in the microwave, you might accidentally melt it. Try grating the butter against the coarse side of a box grater before using it in the recipe. This works best if the butter is very cold or frozen. Try this trick the next time you're baking biscuits or scones. It's much easier than rubbing or cutting chunks of butter into the dry mixture! The time you spend washing, chopping, and preparing ingredients adds up if you're cooking every day. To save on some of this prep time, consider what you'll be cooking for the week and prep the ingredients at the same time. Then, you can just pull what you need out of the refrigerator when you're ready to cook. For example, if you need diced onion for 2 meals, chop the onion and store them in separate containers in the refrigerator. If you're making rice for dinner and you also plan to serve it in a few days, make a double batch and refrigerate half of it. If you're making a few different things to serve, think about which dishes take the longest to cook and which can be prepared right before serving. If it helps you stay organized, write down a timeline of when to prep and cook each dish. Your list might look like this: Marinate chicken for 3 hours Start the grill 30 minutes before dinner time Remove the chicken and thread it onto skewers Put the chicken skewers on the grill Bring a pot of water to boil and cook rice noodles Remove the chicken from the grill Make a tossed salad to serve with the chicken and rice noodles Your food will cook evenly if the oven is already at the recommended temperature when you put the food in. If you put food into a cold oven while it's heating up, it will take longer to cook and the bottom or outside of the food could overcook before the center is done. For example, if you toss a frozen pizza into a cold oven that's heating up, the bottom may burn while the center only becomes warm. If you put it into a hot oven, the whole pizza will cook within the recommended time.","output":"The article provides tips on how to save time and improve efficiency in the kitchen by organizing and preparing ingredients beforehand, chopping vegetables into smaller pieces, grating butter, planning meal prep for the week, creating a cooking timeline, and preheating the oven for even cooking."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = Blue Spice, food = Japanese, priceRange = more than £30, area = riverside Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"Certainly!

Question: suppose crust is pushed upward happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer the question, let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Gases cause pressure beneath the Earth. Justification: Gases are formed due to the Earth's mantle melting and producing magma. As the magma gets closer to the Earth's crust, the pressure of these gases increases. Step 2: The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface. Justification: When the pressure of the gases becomes too high, they push the molten magma towards the Earth's surface, eventually reaching a weak point in the crust and erupting. Step 3: The magma cools. Justification: Once the magma reaches the Earth's surface, it starts to cool down and solidify, forming volcanic rocks and other materials. Step 4: With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly. Justification: As more magma and gases accumulate beneath the crust, the pressure continues to build, eventually resulting in a volcanic eruption. Step 5: The resulting volcano may explode. Justification: If the pressure builds up to a certain threshold, it may cause a large, explosive eruption. Now, let's consider the scenario where the crust is pushed upward, and how it may affect smaller eruptions: If the crust is pushed upward, the pressure required for an eruption could increase, as the magma would need to travel a greater distance to reach the surface. This could lead to: 1. Less effect on smaller eruptions - If the pressure required for smaller eruptions is not significantly changed by the crust being pushed upward, then it is possible that these eruptions will continue to occur at a similar frequency and intensity. 2. More effect on smaller eruptions - If the increased distance and pressure required for the magma to reach the surface significantly impacts smaller eruptions, they may become less frequent or less intense, as more pressure would be needed for an eruption to occur. 3. No effect on smaller eruptions - If the upward movement of the crust has no significant impact on the pressure required for an eruption or the magma's ability to reach the surface, then the smaller eruptions may continue to occur as they were previously. In summary, the answer to the question is dependent on the specific conditions and how much the crust is pushed upward. If the crust's movement significantly changes the pressure required for eruptions, it may result in smaller eruptions occurring less frequently or less intensely. On the other hand, if there is no significant impact on the pressure required for eruptions, there may be no effect on smaller eruptions."},{"instruction":"Teacher:Given a sentence in the Japanese, provide an equivalent translation in Filipino that retains the same meaning through the translation.

However, I can offer some general insights into the potential behavior of someone who has been described as an only child and spoiled by their parents. It is important to remember that individual actions and preferences will still vary greatly based on personality, experiences, and personal values. A spoiled child who gets anything they want may develop a sense of entitlement and a lack of empathy towards others. They might be prone to impulsive behavior and struggle with decision-making because they have not learned how to handle disappointment or consider the needs of others. Their actions might be primarily self-focused and oriented towards immediate gratification. In the context of what Casey might want to do next, it could be related to seeking pleasure, obtaining material possessions, or engaging in stimulating experiences. This could include shopping sprees, lavish vacations, dining out at expensive restaurants, or participating in exclusive events. However, it is important to note that these are generalizations and may not accurately reflect Casey's individual desires or actions. It is also possible that Casey might want to make a change and develop a greater sense of responsibility and empathy due to increased self-awareness or external influences. Their actions could shift towards self-improvement, helping others, or working on personal goals that align with their values and interests.

Syntax: The sentence \\"It surprised me that you came early.\\" follows the syntactic structure of a typical English sentence. It begins with a pronoun (It) followed by a verb (surprised), an indirect object (me), and a subordinate clause (that you came early). This subordinate clause itself has a subject (you), a verb (came), and an adverb (early). The sentence adheres to the S-V-O (Subject-Verb-Object) structure, which is fundamental in English grammar, making it syntactically acceptable. 2. Semantics: This sentence conveys a clear and unambiguous meaning. The speaker expresses surprise at the fact that the person they were addressing arrived early. The semantics are easily understood by the reader or listener, which suggests that the sentence is acceptable from a semantic standpoint. 3. Morphology: All words in the sentence are appropriately inflected and combined to convey the intended meaning. The past tense of the verb 'come' is accurately rendered as 'came', and the adverb 'early' accurately complements the meaning of the subordinate clause. These elements demonstrate correct morphological usage, and as such, a linguist would likely rate the sentence as acceptable. 4. Pragmatics: In terms of pragmatics, the sentence effectively communicates the speaker's intended message, which is to convey their surprise at someone's early arrival. The context could be a meeting, social gathering, or any other event where punctuality or time management is relevant. Given the sentence's clear communicative purpose, a linguist would likely find it pragmatically acceptable. 5. Punctuation and capitalization: The sentence is punctuated correctly, with no unnecessary or missing punctuation marks, and appropriate capitalization of the first letter ('I' in It). This level of adherence to punctuation and capitalization rules would contribute to the sentence's overall acceptability. In conclusion, a linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"It surprised me that you came early\\" as acceptable based on its syntax, semantics, morphology, pragmatics, and proper use of punctuation and capitalization. The sentence adheres to core linguistic rules and effectively communicates a clear and understandable message to the reader or listener."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Two women talk as a toddler yawns.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The toddler is going to take a nap now.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Step by step answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the Premise The premise is: \\"Two women talk as a toddler yawns.\\" Step 2: Understand the Hypothesis The hypothesis is: \\"The toddler is going to take a nap now.\\" Step 3: Assess the Relationship Between the Premise and Hypothesis The premise provides information about two women talking and a toddler yawning. The hypothesis suggests that the toddler is going to take a nap now. Step 4: Determine Entailment Entailment means that the information stated in the premise would logically and necessarily lead to the conclusion stated in the hypothesis. In this case, the fact that a toddler yawns does not necessarily mean they are going to take a nap immediately. A yawn may be an indication of tiredness, but it does not guarantee that the toddler will be taking a nap at that exact moment. Step 5: Select the Correct Option Based on the analysis, the appropriate option is: it is not possible to tell.

The first clause \\"El hombre sabio aprende de los errores de los demás\\": - \\"El hombre sabio\\" (The wise man) is the subject. \\"El\\" is the definite article, \\"hombre\\" means man, and \\"sabio\\" means wise. The adjective \\"sabio\\" is used postpositively after \\"hombre,\\" following the general pattern in Spanish. - \\"aprende\\" (learns) is the verb, which is conjugated in the third person singular of the present indicative tense from the infinitive \\"aprender\\" (to learn), fitting the subject \\"El hombre sabio.\\" - \\"de los errores\\" (from the mistakes) is a prepositional phrase that acts as a complement of \\"aprende\\" to indicate the origin or cause of the learning. \\"de\\" is the preposition, \\"los\\" is the definite article, and \\"errores\\" is the plural noun for \\"mistakes.\\" - \\"de los demás\\" (of others) is another prepositional phrase that specifies whose mistakes are being learned from. \\"de\\" is the preposition, \\"los\\" is the definite article, and \\"demás\\" is a pronoun meaning \\"others.\\" 2. The second clause \\"el ignorante solo aprende de los suyos\\": - \\"el ignorante\\" (the ignorant) is the subject. \\"El\\" is the definite article, and \\"ignorante\\" is an adjective functioning as a noun, meaning a person who is ignorant. - \\"solo\\" (only) is an adverb modifying \\"aprende\\" (learns), indicating that the learning is limited to a specific source or situation. - \\"aprende\\" (learns) is the verb, conjugated the same way as in the first clause. - \\"de los suyos\\" (from his own) is a prepositional phrase functioning as a complement of \\"aprende,\\" indicating the origin or cause of the learning, as in the first clause. \\"de\\" is the preposition, \\"los\\" is the definite article, and \\"suyos\\" is the plural form of the possessive pronoun \\"suyo,\\" which refers to the mistakes of the subject, \\"el ignorante.\\" The sentence as a whole contrasts the behavior and attitude of a wise person and an ignorant person, emphasizing the importance of learning from the experiences and mistakes of others, not just from one's own experiences."},{"instruction":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Too picturesque...large...

Possible A: flat, bend, and shout, straighten, unravel Why is \\"and shout\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The old song about twisting refers to the popular hit song \\"Twist and Shout,\\" which was originally recorded by The Top Notes in 1961 and later covered by The Isley Brothers and The Beatles. The song's lyrics and upbeat melody encourage listeners to dance and have a good time by twisting their bodies and shouting in excitement. Regarding the possible answers given: 1. Flat, bend: These options are somewhat related to the physical action of twisting, as people might bend or flatten their bodies while dancing to the song. However, these words don't directly pertain to the actual song title or its main theme. 2. Straighten, unravel: These options imply untwisting or undoing a twisted action, which may contradict the idea of dancing to a twist-related song. The answer \\"and shout\\" aligns with human common sense because it is part of the song's title, \\"Twist and Shout,\\" and directly relates to the song's theme of twisting and having a good time. The song inspires people to move, dance, and engage in a form of expression by twisting their bodies while also shouting in response to the lively music.

You may think people in such an attractive and exciting, fun-filled place are happier than others. If so, you have some mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness. Many intelligent people still consider happiness equal to fun. The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common. Fun is what we experience during an act. Happiness is what we experience after an act. It is a deeper, more lasting emotion. Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are fun activities that help us relax, temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh. But they do not bring happiness, because their positive effects end when the fun ends. I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play, it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun. These rich, beautiful people have constant access to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive homes, everything that brings \\"happiness\\".

Acid rain can cause the alteration of soil composition, leaching away essential nutrients such as calcium, and releasing harmful substances like aluminum. This negatively impacts plant growth, causing the weakening or death of trees and other vegetation, and can contribute to forest decline. As trees and plants suffer from the effects of acid rain, the ecosystems they support also suffer. The death of aquatic life due to acidic water disrupts the food chain, affecting organisms at various trophic levels, and reducing biodiversity. Terrestrial animals that depend on the plants and trees for food, shelter, and habitat will also be impacted by the decline in forest health caused by acid rain. As a result, entire ecosystems can become compromised, causing a ripple effect that reaches far beyond the immediate plants and animals directly affected by acid rain."},{"instruction":"That be it looks carisma and talent Hes just fantastic the man all men want to be and all women want Of course Im talking about Sir Sean Connery Add punctuation.","output":"That's it; he looks charismatic and talented.

The original statement provides us with the following information: 1. The man is formally dressed: This information indicates that the man is wearing clothes that are appropriate for formal occasions. This could include events such as weddings, sophisticated parties, business meetings, or any other events with a formal dress code. However, we cannot deduce that this specific event is a wedding based on this information alone. 2. The man is smiling upwards: The man's facial expression and direction imply that he is feeling joy, happiness, or satisfaction as he performs the split. However, this information does not necessarily link his behavior to a wedding. There could be various reasons for the man to express happiness while doing a split during a formal occasion, but we cannot ascertain any particular reason with the current data. 3. The man performs a split: Lastly, the man is executing a split - a challenging and often attention-grabbing move. This part of the statement also does not provide any direct connection to a wedding. In conclusion, the statement \\"The formally-dressed man smiles upwards as he does a split.\\" does not logically imply that \\"A man in classy clothes performs a split at a wedding.\\" Although it is plausible that the event might be a wedding, there is not enough information or context provided to confirm this assumption.

Question: What was going on in Eastern Europe? Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus.

While it is true that cars in colder climates (such as the northern regions) may be less reliant on air conditioning, there are several other factors to consider. 1. The age of the car: Older cars may not have air conditioning, regardless of their geographical origin. Automotive air conditioning systems started to become more popular during the 1960s, but they were not a standard feature in all vehicles until later years. 2. The make and model of the car: Cars vary in their features, and not all cars are equipped with air conditioning. Some low-cost or basic models may omit air conditioning to make them more affordable. 3. Owner preference: The original owner of the car may have chosen not to have air conditioning installed due to personal preference, regardless of the location. 4. Cost of installation and maintenance: Installing and maintaining an air conditioning system can be expensive. For some car owners, especially those in a tight budget, the expense may not be worth the potential benefit. 5. Climate change: The need for air conditioning in cars has increased over the years as global temperatures have risen. A car from a currently colder northern region may not have needed air conditioning in the past when temperatures were cooler. 6. Cultural factors: Some individuals or communities may not prioritize air conditioning in their cars due to a cultural preference for fresh air and natural ventilation. Given these factors, it would be a hasty generalization to conclude that the car is from the north based only on the lack of air conditioning. More information about the car itself, as well as the preferences and circumstances of the original owner would be required in order to make a more informed judgment."},{"instruction":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: SimPadSkillReportercalculatesanoverallperformancescore,andsummarisesareasforimprovement,fromthedataobtainedduringtraining.","output":"The SimPad SkillReporter, a sophisticated device used in training simulations, calculates an overall performance score and summarizes areas for improvement from the data obtained during the training exercises.

Kaplow had also paid Lootz's casino debts, and Bernie has been working off that large debt to Shelly for several years and the debt is nearly paid off. Lootz is weary of the casino business, and tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. His future success as a luck \\"cooler\\" is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luck—and that of those around him—takes a turn for the better. What Bernie doesn't know yet is that Shelly has paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working at the Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn't know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie, and vice versa. Additional complications arise when Shelly, a relative old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers, including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov, to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century. Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town, and, with his wife, is interfering with the operations at the Shangri-La. Though Shelly still has the backing of certain mob associates, such as gangster Nicky Fingers, the growing power of the new young Ivy League casino owners is lessening his power grip on the casino and the business he truly loves., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The full name of the person Shelly paid to seduce Bernie Lootz is Natalie Belisario. In the article, it is mentioned that cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario seemingly takes an interest in Bernie Lootz, whose luck improves thanks to her presence. However, it is later revealed that Shelly Kaplow, the casino boss, had paid Natalie to seduce Bernie and keep him working at the Shangri-La casino.

As an AI language model, I'm struggling to understand the precise meaning of the statement, so I'll provide you with some information about Claude Shannon and his involvement with computer chess instead. Claude Shannon was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer, known for his groundbreaking work in information theory and digital circuit design. In 1948, Shannon published \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication,\\" a paper that laid the foundations for modern digital communication and data compression. Shannon also dabbled in artificial intelligence and computer chess. In 1950, he published a paper titled \\"Programming a Computer for Playing Chess,\\" which outlined the basic strategy for developing a chess-playing computer program. Shannon described two principal methods for a computer to search through possible moves – a brute-force approach and a selective approach. The brute-force approach involves generating all possible moves for a given position and then evaluating them, while the selective approach analyzes only a subset of possible moves, reducing the computational complexity. To sum up, Claude Shannon was indeed involved in computer chess during the early stages of computer science and artificial intelligence development. However, the provided statement does not accurately communicate this information. A clearer statement might be: \\"Claude Shannon was involved in the development of computer chess, as evidenced by his contributions in the field of artificial intelligence and strategy for programming a chess-playing computer.\\""},{"instruction":"Paragraph: Elaan is a declaration of war against the reign of terror unleashed by the ganglords .

His father Daniel was employed by the Irish Electricity Supply Board, who were constructing Cathaleen's Fall hydroelectric power station on the Erne River above the town. The family moved, first to Derry City, where his younger brother Donal was born in 1949. His mother, Monica, and the two boys then moved to Cork, where the brothers were raised. Gallagher played a worn sunburst 1961 Stratocaster (Serial Number 64351) for some years. It was reputedly the first in Ireland,and was ordered from Fender by Jim Connolly, a member of The Irish Showband. In 1961, Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop of Cork's McCurtain Street. When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead, it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument, which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just under PS100. Speaking about Gallagher's purchase, his brother Donal recalled: \\"His dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds... in today's money you couldn't even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds... my mother was saying we'll be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like.\\" The guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher. The tuning pegs and the nut were replaced, the latter interchanged a number of times. The pickguard was also changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one. Most of the paint was removed from the guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as evidenced from contemporary photographs. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image. It also had a period of time of having a replacement neck, with the original neck bowing due to the amount of moisture it absorbed during continuous touring. The neck was taken off and left to settle, and was eventually reunited with the Strat after returning to its correct shape. Other quirks include a 'hump' in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side, and a replacement of all of the pick-ups, though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy. One final point of interest is that one of the clay double-dot inlays at the 12th fret fell out and was replaced with a plastic one, which is why it is whiter than the other clay inlays. On 21 and 22 October 2011, Rory's brother Donal brought the guitar out of retirement to allow Joe Bonamassa to perform with it on his two nights at the London Hammersmith Apollo. Bonamassa opened both night's performances with his rendition of \\"Cradle Rock\\" using Gallagher's Stratocaster. What is a stratocaster?","output":"A Stratocaster is a model of electric guitar designed by Leo Fender, George Fullerton, and Freddie Tavares in 1954. It has been manufactured by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation continuously since its introduction. The Stratocaster is known for its sleek, contoured body, double-cutaway design, and versatile sound, making it a popular choice for many guitarists.

Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case.

Choices: - wet soil - start to fall - dry soil - wet things - wet ground The rationale to choose \\"wet soil\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"Worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain because of wet soil. The rationale behind choosing \\"wet soil\\" as the answer is threefold: 1. Oxygen availability: Worms breathe through their skin, and when the soil gets saturated with rainwater, there is a reduced availability of oxygen. To ensure sufficient oxygen supply and avoid suffocation, worms move up and out of the wet soil. 2. Ease of movement: Wet soil is softer and more manageable, making it easier for worms to navigate through the earth. Rainwater helps to lubricate the soil particles and reduces the friction that hinders worms' movement when the soil is dry. This provides an excellent opportunity for worms to move to new areas, find food, and escape predators. 3. Mating opportunities: Earthworms may come to the surface during heavy rainfall for mating purposes. The wet conditions create a favorable environment for worms to release their mucus-coated cocoons containing eggs and sperm. This allows fertilization to occur when the worms come in contact with each other. In summary, the primary reason worms crawl out of the earth during rain is the wet soil, which makes it easier for them to move, breathe, and reproduce."},{"instruction":"Solve -418*k = 109*k - 78*k + 17062 for k.

Sheriff James McCoy, a tough middle-aged widower, does everything he can to maintain law and order and shield the town from the ruthless outlaws that are drawn to Dry Gulch Prairie's suffering. In these difficult times, the townsfolk are increasingly reliant on water shipments brought in from a nearby well, but when a crafty gang of bandits, led by the charismatic outlaw Cassidy Black, steals their latest delivery, the town's survival hangs by a thread. Sheriff McCoy knows that he must retrieve the stolen water bag -- the last bag filled with life-saving water in the region -- at any cost. As a result, he forms a small posse of the bravest and most skilled townsfolk, including his feisty, independent daughter Sarah, the town's only doctor, and an enigmatic ex-outlaw named Marcus. Together, they embark on a perilous journey through the desert and discover the gang's hideout nestled among the rocky cliffs. The posse is met with intense resistance, and as the bullets fly, Sarah manages to reclaim the precious water bag. But in a terrible twist of fate, Sheriff McCoy -- distracted by a sudden attack -- inadvertently shoots a hole in the water bag. The holes in the water bag lead to a wild chase as the water leaks out, starting a desperate race against time to bring what's left of the water back to Dry Gulch Prairie. Along the way, trust and betrayal lurk around every corner, with Marcus caught in a moral dilemma between his new friends, for whom he had started to care, and his involvement in the past with Cassidy Black. As the water supply dwindles, the bandits hound their every step, culminating in an epic final showdown between Sheriff McCoy and Cassidy Black. Marcus's ultimate loyalties are put to the test, and Sarah must summon every ounce of bravery and resourcefulness to save the town she loves so dearly. The film ends with the triumphant return of Sheriff McCoy and his posse, their victory marred somewhat by their knowledge of the race against the clock that still lies ahead. However, they are greeted with renewed hope when they arrive at the town, as the first drops of rain begin to fall; a testament to the resilience of humanity and the power of hope, even in the face of unimaginable challenges. \\"The Last Drop\\" is a heart-pounding adventure, packed with action, intrigue, and emotional depth -- a bold testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid. The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily. How long did it probably take the author to try to the Mediterranean diet? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. not enough information B. many years C. a few days D. a few weeks","output":"A. not enough information"},{"instruction":"There is likely to be no student absent. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence, I will analyze it step-by-step based on the following factors: 1. Syntax: I will check if the sentence structure follows the rules of grammar. 2. Semantics: I will evaluate the meaning and clarity of the sentence. 3. Pragmatics: I will determine the effectiveness of the sentence in conveying its intended message in context. Step 1: Syntax Analysis \\"There is likely to be no student absent.\\" - The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern. - \\"There is\\" functions as an existential introductory phrase, indicating the existence or presence of something. - \\"Likely\\" acts as an adverb modifying the verb \\"to be.\\" - \\"No\\" functions as a determiner emphasizing the absence of the noun \\"student.\\" - \\"Absent\\" serves as an adjective describing the noun \\"student.\\" The syntax of the sentence appears to be grammatically correct. Step 2: Semantics Analysis - \\"There is likely to be\\" indicates a future probability or expectation. - \\"No student absent\\" suggests a scenario where none of the students are absent. The sentence seems to convey the meaning that it's probable that all students will be present. Step 3: Pragmatics Analysis Considering the context is crucial for pragmatics analysis. However, since we don't have any specific context, we evaluate the sentence in isolation. - The sentence communicates the expectation that all students will likely be present. - Without context, the appropriateness of the sentence for a particular situation cannot be determined. But the sentence is clear enough to infer the speaker's intended message. Based on this step-by-step analysis, the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence appears to be sound. However, the true effectiveness of the sentence can only be determined when taken within the context of a broader conversation or situation."},{"instruction":"Question: when did pee wee herman hosts saturday night live?

Comparing the main subjects: In the first statement, the subject is \\"A person\\", which can refer to any individual, regardless of gender. In the second statement, the subject is \\"A woman\\", which specifically refers to a female individual or someone who identifies as a woman. Although \\"A woman\\" is a subset of \\"A person\\", the two statements are not an exact match in terms of the main subject, as the second statement is more specific. 2. Comparing the location: Both statements mention that the individual is standing on jagged rocks, so this part of the location is a match between the two statements. 3. Comparing the vertical position: In both statements, the individual is located above the water below. This aspect also matches between the two statements. 4. Comparing the additional detail in the second statement: The second statement includes the information about a cliff, which isn't mentioned in the first statement.

She waited for 3 hours but the pool wasn't full, so she decides to add another hose that sprays 70 gallons/hour, and after 2 more hours the pool is full. How much water can Grace’s pool contain? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"To find out how much water Grace's pool can contain, we need to break down the problem into multiple steps and calculate the amount of water filled by each hose during the given time. Step 1: Calculate the amount of water filled by the first hose. The first hose sprays 50 gallons per hour, and Grace used it for 3 hours. To find the total amount of water filled by this hose, we'll multiply the gallons per hour by the number of hours: 50 gallons/hour * 3 hours = 150 gallons Step 2: Calculate the amount of water filled by both hoses together. After 3 hours, Grace decided to add a second hose that sprays 70 gallons per hour. She used both hoses for an additional 2 hours. To find the total amount of water filled by both hoses during that time, we'll add the gallons per hour from both hoses and then multiply by the number of hours: (50 gallons/hour + 70 gallons/hour) * 2 hours = (120 gallons/hour) * 2 hours = 240 gallons Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water in the pool. Now, we'll add the amount of water filled by each hose to find the total amount of water in the pool: 150 gallons (from first hose) + 240 gallons (from both hoses) = 390 gallons So, Grace's pool can contain a total of 390 gallons of water."},{"instruction":"Normative dimension Translate to French.","output":"La dimension normative est une expression qui désigne une façon de voir les choses et de décider si elles sont bonnes, mauvaises, normales ou anormales.

As a junior, Barkley stood 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and weighed 220 pounds (100 kg). He failed to make the varsity team and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer Barkley grew to 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) and earned a starting position on the varsity as a senior. Context: Barkley was invited by Bob Knight to try out for United States men's basketball team for the 1984 Summer Olympics. He made it all the way to final cuts, but wasn't selected for the team, despite outplaying almost all of the front-court players there. According to Knight, Barkley was cut because of poor defense. Barkley competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States men's basketball team. International rules which had previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The result was the \\"Dream Team\\", which went 6-0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8-0 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points. Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single game scoring record with 30 points in a 127-83 victory over Brazil. He also set a U.S. Men's Olympic record for highest three-point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game. Barkley was also part of an ugly moment in the 1992 Olympics when he intentionally elbowed Angola player Herlander Coimbra in the chest during a 116-48 rout of that team. At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Barkley led the team in scoring, rebounds, and field goal percentage. He averaged 12.4 points on 81.6% field goal shooting, setting a U.S. Men's Olympic record. In addition, he also contributed 6.6 rebounds per game. Under Barkley's leadership, the team once again compiled a perfect 8-0 record and captured gold medal honors. Question: When did he enter the Olympics?

His terms essentially stated that the Spanish would settle the Navajo in pueblos and energetically convert them to the Catholic religion. The Navajo were not interested in either of these proposals. They rejected the treaty and renewed the fight. Six New Mexicans were killed at Socorro in April and eight more at Sabinal in May. On 18 June 1823, Vizcarra led 1,500 troops in a 74-day expedition against the Navajo of western New Mexico. His route took him through the Chuska Mountains to the Hopi mesas in what is now Arizona, then north towards Utah, reaching Oljeto Creek in what is now San Juan County, Utah. Thirty-three Navajo were killed, of whom eight were women, and about 30 were captured. The expedition reached Canyon de Chelly in what is now eastern Arizona. In retaliation for Vizcarra's expedition, the Navajo raided Socorro again, and attacked Tome, Albuquerque and reached the outskirts of Santa Fe. The 1823 raid marked the start of a long period of raids and counter raids lasting until 1848 as New Mexicans took Navajo captive to work as slaves, and as Navajo raided to recover their people and to obtain livestock.

The Uighurs are Muslims. They regard themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. The region's economy has for centuries revolved around agriculture and trade, with towns such as Kashgar thriving as hubs along the famous Silk Road. In the early part of the 20th Century, the Uighurs briefly declared independence. The region was brought under the complete control of communist China in 1949. Xinjiang is officially designated an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south. Activists say central government policies have gradually curtailed the Uighurs' religious, commercial and cultural activities. Beijing is accused of intensifying a crackdown after street protests in Xinjiang in the 1990s, and again in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Over the past decade, many prominent Uighurs have been imprisoned or have sought asylum abroad after being accused of terrorism. Mass immigration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang had made Uighurs a minority in Xinjiang. Beijing is accused of exaggerating the threat from Uighur separatists in order to justify repression in the region. China's central government says Uighur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest. Since the 9/11 attacks in the US, China has increasingly portrayed its Uighur separatists as auxiliaries of al-Qaeda, saying they have received training in Afghanistan. Little evidence has been produced in support of these claims. More than 20 Uighurs were captured by the US military after its invasion of Afghanistan. They were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay for years without being charged with any offence and most have now been resettled elsewhere. Almost 200 people died in ethnic riots in Urumqi, the administrative capital of Xinjiang, in July 2009. One of the sparks for the violence seems to have been the deaths of two Uighurs in clashes with Han Chinese at a factory thousands of miles away in southern China. The authorities blame Xinjiang separatists based outside China for the unrest, and they singled out exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer, saying she incited the violence. She denied any responsibility for the violence. Uighur exiles say police fired indiscriminately on peaceful protests, leading to violence and deaths. Xinjiang has received huge state investment in industrial and energy projects, and Beijing has been keen to highlight these as major steps forward. But many Uighurs complain that the Han are taking their jobs, and that their farmland has been confiscated for redevelopment. The activities of local and foreign journalists are closely monitored by the state and there are few independent sources of news from the region. However, occasional attacks on Chinese targets suggest Uighur separatism remains a potent and potentially violent force. Summary:","output":"The Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group in China's Xinjiang region, face increasing repression from Beijing, which is accused of curtailing their religious, commercial, and cultural activities and exaggerating the threat of Uighur separatism to justify its actions."},{"instruction":"Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

These keys, when pressed, produce musical notes that can be combined to create beautiful melodies and harmonies. A piano is a versatile instrument and can be found in various musical genres, such as classical, jazz, and pop. The black and white keys are the most recognizable and quintessential feature of this instrument. These keys comprise of 52 white keys representing the natural notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and 36 black keys representing the accidental notes (sharp and flat). Together, they provide a full range of 88 keys, which can span over seven octaves plus a minor third. Explanation for the other options: A. Front pocket - This refers to a pocket located on the front of an item, like pants, a bag, or a jacket. Front pockets typically hold small items like keys, wallets, or cell phones but not black and white keys as described in the question. B. Cabinet - A cabinet is a piece of furniture used for storage. While cabinets can hold various items, such as dishes, documents, or clothing, they are not typically associated with black and white keys. C. Purse - A purse is a small bag used by women to carry personal items, such as money, keys, and makeup. While it may hold small items like keys, it does not refer to the black and white keys described in the question. D. Chain - A chain is a series of connected metal links that can be used to fasten or secure objects. Although keys can be attached to a chain, the black and white keys mentioned in the question do not fit this context. In conclusion, the best answer to the question about the black and white keys is the piano (option E). This answer is logically connected to the keys' description and indicates that they belong to a musical instrument widely recognized for its black and white keys."},{"instruction":"Premise: hum then you'll never leave yeah oh Hypothesis: You'll never leave.

Another student: Let's say, hmmm...","output":"In this problem, we are given that the first four tosses result in heads. We want to find the probability of a tail appearing in the fifth toss. The probability of a tail or a head appearing in any given toss is independent of the previous tosses. This means that the result of the fifth toss does not depend on the previous four tosses, even though they were all heads. A fair coin has two equally likely outcomes - heads (H) and tails (T). So, the probability of getting heads or tails in any given toss is the same: P(Heads) = 1/2 P(Tails) = 1/2 So, the probability of getting a tail in the fifth toss, regardless of the results of the previous tosses, is: P(Tails in 5th toss) = 1/2 Therefore, the answer is (B) 1/2."},{"instruction":"No, this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach, fairy godmother and the glass slippers, but if I were to elaborate, I would have to spoil it for you, which I won't. But don't let curiosity get the better of you, as this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those movies that start off promisingly, before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline. And that's real horror. Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One's a successful plastic surgeon, while the other your dutiful, obedient, and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like hand in glove, so close you'd think of them more as siblings rather than parent-child. But things start to go wrong (don't they always) when Hyun-soo's friends, whom Yoon-hee has operated on, start to go berserk. Perhaps it's a warning to audiences, and for those Koreans ladies who don't bat an eyelid when going under the knife, if news reports are to be believed. The only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, though somehow, I thought Kim Ki-duk's Time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself. It's a tale of two halves, the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics, which, I admit, did get to me now and then. However, the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo-jumbo melodramatics, and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat. Some things begin not to make sense, and while attempts are always presented to explain, you probably won't buy it, not that horror movies are logical to begin with. The leads are all beautiful, and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role. But hey, I'm not complaining, though the storyline could have been improved tremendously. I'd recommend you to watch this, only if you're a fan of mediocre Korean horror, on VCD. Watch out for those face off-ish moments! Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is largely negative. The reviewer seems disappointed with the movie, mentioning its incoherence, cheap scare tactics, and mindless melodrama. They mention that the movie is not fantastic and suggest watching it only if one is a fan of mediocre Korean horror. However, they do admit to being scared now and then, and appreciate the beautiful lead actors.

The other options given do not provide a practical solution to the problem, while air out resolves the issue effectively without causing any damage to the clothes. 1. Hang in closet: Hanging the smelly clothes in the closet might not alleviate the smell. In fact, it could cause the smell to spread to other clothes, making the problem worse. A closet can be a confined space, which could trap the odor and make it linger even longer. 2. Sniff: Sniffing the smelly clothes would not provide any solution to the issue. It would only confirm that the clothes indeed have a smell. 3. Get dirty: Getting the clothes dirty would not help the situation. Adding more dirt and grime to the clothes would not remove the smell but may even make it worse. 4. Become soiled: Similar to getting the clothes dirty, becoming soiled would also not help in solving the odor problem; it would only add to the discomfort and make the clothes even less wearable. On the other hand: 5. Air out: Airing out the clothes involves hanging them outside or in a well-ventilated area, allowing fresh air and sunlight to naturally neutralize the smell. Airing out the clothes can help eliminate odors by allowing the smell to dissipate into the air. Moreover, sunlight has natural antibacterial and odor-neutralizing properties, which can further help in removing the smell from the clothes. In conclusion, a human would choose to \\"air out\\" smelly clothes that cannot be washed, because it is the most effective and practical method among the given options. Airing out allows for natural odor removal, does not cause any harm to the clothes, and prevents the spread of smell to other garments.

Will it permanently change the face of the Official Singles Chart as we know it? Will unknown artists potentially break into the top 10? We spoke to George Ergatoudis, Head of Music for BBC Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra. Streaming's gradually grown over the last couple of years. Meanwhile, digital downloads had been growing up until about nine months ago and looking at the data, they started to go into decline. I think there is a real correlation there, that streaming is starting to grow and it's starting to eat into download sales. So we've had week on week, for the last nine months, a decline in the amount of digital music being purchased. There is going to be an effect. It's not hugely significant because at the end of the day we're looking at huge volumes to get into the top 40, huge numbers of people listening to a song or huge numbers of people deciding to download it each week, actually those two are very closely connected. There's only ever so many truly memorable, powerful hit records in the market at any point in time that the huge mass market scale people are interested in. So actually the differences are there but they are relatively slight. I think that is actually the biggest issue out there at the moment, everybody has got access to so much music, how do you get to know what you like? Take a snapshot of what records at any moment in time people are enjoying listening to, it could be because it was on an advert or a film like Frozen or it could be because it is heavily supported on radio. Culturally there is still a huge import to the chart, as a kind of very simple measure of the most popular records in the market at any point in time, and that's a powerful play in terms of discovery as much as anything. We've got a pretty good awareness of what is going on in the market but there's no doubt we do keep a close eye. There's certain tracks occasionally and certain artists where we've decided we'll wait a little longer on it, see how it goes before we commit to putting them on the playlist. When you can see that they are doing really well in streaming or they are doing really well in the sales chart, then of course that can be an important bit of information to say there's quite a large number of people who are enjoying it, we should look at that again. No, I think it's really important that if we are talking about an accurate reflection of what people are listening to or are consuming in 2014 we need to include streaming alongside sales. But in terms of the dramatic effect or change it will have, no, because actually the top 40 as a snapshot of a moment in time works and it's very similar in both the streaming space and in the singles purchasing space. Follow us @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and @Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube Summary:","output":"The inclusion of streaming data in the Top 40 is being seen as one of the biggest changes since downloads were added in 2005, and it has sparked discussions about whether it will change the face of the Official Singles Chart as we know it. In an interview, George Ergatoudis, Head of Music for BBC Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra, revealed that streaming has gradually grown over the last couple of years while digital downloads have started to decline. This correlation suggests that streaming is eating into download sales. Although the effects of this shift might not be hugely significant, it does represent a change in the way people consume music. Ergatoudis argues that finding music people like is the biggest issue, as there is now so much access to it. The Top 40, therefore, remains an important tool for discovering popular records in the market at any point in time. As for unknown artists potentially breaking into the top 10, Ergatoudis acknowledges that certain tracks and artists occasionally receive close attention from the industry before being added to playlists or promoted more widely. Streaming performance can be an important factor in determining whether an artist is worth further consideration. Overall, including streaming data alongside sales is essential for accurately reflecting music consumption in 2014. While it may not have a dramatic effect on the Top 40's composition, it does represent a more comprehensive snapshot of the music landscape at any given moment."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: Her flow was getting knotted, so she put up the convertible's top next time she was what?

Positive Yelp Review: Title: An Unforgettable Dining Experience at Culinary Dreams! Review: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I had an absolutely incredible time dining at Culinary Dreams last weekend, and I cannot sing their praises enough. This restaurant has managed to create an unforgettable experience, succeeding in both impeccable service and wonderfully diverse, mouth-watering dishes. From the moment I entered the premises, the ambience was nothing short of fantastic. The warm lighting combined with the beautifully arranged décor gave off a welcoming and cozy atmosphere. To enhance the experience, a soft, soothing live jazz performance provided the perfect musical backdrop as we enjoyed our meal. Upon being seated by the ever-friendly and professionally dressed host, the extensive and diverse menu offered a variety of dishes I was eager to try. The assortment of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options was impressive, that catered to the different dietary preferences of our party. To start, we ordered the bruschetta trio, which was a hit among my companions. The three unique variants - classic tomato and basil, sweet balsamic caramelized onions, and avocado and beet - created a perfect harmony of flavors, with each bite more delightful than the last. As the main course, I chose the pan-seared sea bass, and it was truly among the best I’ve ever sampled. The fish was tender and flavorful, while the accompanying lemon-caper sauce perfectly enhanced the dish without overpowering it. To top it off, the garlic mashed potatoes were creamy, smooth, and full of flavor - a star component themselves. Considering their attention to detail and a wide variety of desserts to choose from, it was almost impossible to select just one! We collectively decided to share their decadent chocolate lava cake and the fruity, refreshing mango-passionfruit cheesecake. Both were heavenly, with the rich, gooey chocolate lava cake soothing our sweet cravings and the velvety cheesecake lightening the palate. In addition to their impressive menu, the service at Culinary Dreams was exceptional. Our server, Amanda, went above and beyond to make sure our dining experience was nothing short of perfect. Attentive, informative, and exceptionally friendly, Amanda made stellar recommendations and ensured all our needs were met throughout the evening. Overall, my experience at Culinary Dreams far exceeded my expectations. This gem of a restaurant offers divine dishes to satisfy any craving, impeccable service that makes you feel at home, and an atmosphere that ensures an unforgettable dining experience. I recommend Culinary Dreams to everyone, and I cannot wait to return for another remarkable evening."},{"instruction":"Which entity is this text about? Born in Drouin to Alfred and Colleen Ablett, Gary Ablett grew up in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria's Gippsland region alongside his four elder brothers and three sisters. Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Ablett signed a one-year contract for the 1984 season with Geelong, and he began his first season under the guidance of Tom Hafey. He debuted for the Cats in Round 7 and after just nine games on the wing, Ablett was selected to his first State of Origin game for Victoria. Ablett earned best-on-ground honours after kicking 8 goals from the half-forward flank. He played 15 games and kicked 33 goals in the 1984 season, and was awarded the Carji Greeves Medal as the Geelong Football Club's \\"best and fairest\\" player of the year. Following his first season with Geelong, Ablett signed a new three-year contract with the club. Playing mostly on the half forward flank, Ablett won the club's goalkicking award for the following two seasons with 82 and 65 goals respectively. Although Ablett had developed a reputation for his laconic, lazy attitude to training under coach John Devine, this did not prevent him from earning top three placings in the best and fairest awards from 1985-87. With his contract expiring at the conclusion of the 1987 season, Ablett shocked the VFL by signing a new five-year contract with his former club, Hawthorn. After a \\"cooling-off\\" period, however, Ablett opted to remain with Geelong by agreeing to a lucrative five-year contract that tied him to the club for the long-term. Ablett began the 1988 season with 59 goals after just 11 games, placing him second on the goalkicking list behind Hawthorn's Jason Dunstall. In these games, he kicked 10 goals against Richmond in the Anzac Day game, and 11 against Brisbane--one shy of breaking the ground record of 12 goals at Carrara. Although he missed out on State honours and failed to place within the top three in the club best and fairest award, Ablett finished with 82 goals during the season for the second time in his career.

Entropy is a concept derived from the second law of thermodynamics, which deals with energy and the spontaneous changes that happen in various physical and chemical systems. Entropy is a significant parameter in understanding the irreversible processes that occur in various systems, as it measures the degree of disorder or randomness in any given system. The higher the entropy value, the greater the disorder or randomness within that system. Chance level, motion, and vector count are not quantities that scientists utilize specifically to measure disorder or randomness. While chance level and vector count may involve aspects of randomness in certain situations, they are not measures of randomness in the context of thermodynamics. Motion, on the other hand, is a fairly general term that refers to the movement of objects due to the action of different forces and is not specifically related to measuring disorder or randomness either.

This mistaken, violent death would echo again and again in Nabokov's fiction, where characters would meet their deaths under accidental terms. (In Pale Fire, for example, one interpretation of the novel has an assassin mistakenly kill the poet John Shade, when his actual target is a fugitive European monarch.) Shortly after his father's death, Nabokov's mother and sister moved to Prague. Nabokov stayed in Berlin, where he had become a recognised poet and writer within the emigre community and published under the nom de plume V. Sirin (a reference to the fabulous bird of Russian folklore). To supplement his scant writing income, he taught languages and gave tennis and boxing lessons. Of his fifteen Berlin years, Dieter E. Zimmer has written: \\"He never became fond of Berlin, and at the end intensely disliked it. He lived within the lively Russian community of Berlin that was more or less self-sufficient, staying on after it had disintegrated because he had nowhere else to go to. He knew little German. He knew few Germans except for landladies, shopkeepers, the petty immigration officials at the police headquarters.\\" In 1922, Nabokov became engaged to Svetlana Siewert; she broke off the engagement in early 1923, her parents worrying that he could not provide for her. In May 1923, he met a Russian-Jewish woman, Vera Evseyevna Slonim, at a charity ball in Berlin and married her in April 1925. Their only child, Dmitri, was born in 1934. In 1936, Vera lost her job because of the increasingly anti-Semitic environment; also in that year the assassin of Nabokov's father was appointed second-in-command of the Russian emigre group. In the same year, Nabokov began seeking a job in the English-speaking world. In 1937, he left Germany for France, where he had a short affair with Russian emigree Irina Guadanini. Yet the family followed him to France, making enroute their last visit to Prague, then spent time in Cannes, Menton, Cap d'Antibes, and Frejus and finally settled together in Paris. In May 1940, the Nabokov family fled from the advancing German troops to the United States on board the SS Champlain, with the exception of Nabokov's brother Sergei, who died at the Neuengamme concentration camp on 9 January 1945.

Soon after composing \\"Halo\\", Tedder worked with Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted (2009), for which they wrote \\"Already Gone\\" together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's \\"Halo\\". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent \\"Already Gone\\" from being included on All I Ever Wanted, but it was impossible to make last minute changes, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce was released. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder commented that he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her criticism was \\"hurtful and absurd\\". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different. Calling \\"Already Gone\\" one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to \\"listen [to the two ballads] and form their own opinions\\". Clarkson also tried to stop her label, RCA, from releasing \\"Already Gone\\" as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, \\"It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it.\\" Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.

Question: suppose air is circulated throughout body happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"To answer this question, let's first examine the steps of the process, and then discuss how circulating air throughout the body may affect the delivery of a smaller amount of oxygen to the bloodstream, as well as its influence on the second effect mentioned. Step by step analysis: 1. A person breathes in oxygen. 2. The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs. 3. The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream. 4. The oxygen circulates through the body. 5. The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide. 6. The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs. 7. The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Suppose air (consisting of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases) is circulated throughout the body rather than pure oxygen. Effect on the delivery of a smaller amount of oxygen to the bloodstream: With air circulating throughout the body, the concentration and availability of oxygen in the bronchial tubes and lungs are likely to be less than if only oxygen were present. This would result in less oxygen being transferred to the bloodstream at step 3, directly affecting the subsequent steps in the process. Effect on the second effect, which is the exchange of oxygen with carbon dioxide in cells: Due to the smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, as mentioned above, the cells in the body would have less oxygen available for exchange with carbon dioxide. Consequently, the rate of exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide may be impaired, potentially affecting cellular respiration and energy production in the body. In conclusion, circulating air throughout the body instead of pure oxygen would likely lead to a less efficient oxygenation process, with a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream and a diminished rate of exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the cells, resulting in a \\"less\\" effect on both."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Step 1: Understanding the premise The premise states \\"Term Limits Now for advocating a constitutional amendment\\". From this, it can be understood that the term limits discussed are immediate or necessary for advocating a constitutional amendment. However, it doesn't clearly specify whether the term limits are for the individuals or groups advocating the amendment, or the term limits refer to the service term of officials which can be changed through a constitutional amendment. Step 2: Understanding the hypothesis The hypothesis is \\"They should have term limits for advocating an amendment\\". This could be interpreted as the individuals or groups advocating for an amendment should have term limits. However, it's not clear if this means limits on the time they have to advocate, or if the advocates should also have term limits in their roles. Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypotheses When comparing both, it's noticeable that they reflect similar concepts which are related to 'term limits' and 'advocacy for a constitutional amendment', but the expressions are still ambiguous. Therefore, considering the ambiguity in both premise and hypothesis, it's difficult to definitively state that the hypothesis \\"They should have term limits for advocating an amendment\\" is true based on the given premise.

Before proceeding, she took a moment to glance at her reflection in the shiny toy iron, a glimmer of determination sparkling in her baby blue eyes. She positioned the iron onto the ironing board meticulously, ensuring it was stationed just right. Then, with an exaggerated seriousness that contradicts her innocent age, she picked up a small piece of clothing. Oh, it was her favourite - a doll's dress, a cute, tiny one, adorned with delicate lace and the teeniest of buttons. To her, it was not just a doll's attire but a royal robe for her beloved companion. This doll was more than a toy; it was her friend, confidante and emblem of her fantasy play world. She laid the dress out flat on the ironing board with a level of care that suggested a working knowledge of the concept of ironing, gained perhaps, from observing her own mother numerous times. Her chubby finger traced the dress’ trim, pointing out imaginary wrinkles that needed to be smoothed. Then, grasping the toy iron in her cute hands, she moved it over the dress with an unwavering focus. Each imaginary wrinkle was painstakingly worked upon, each stroke of her iron a testament to her inherent instinct for care and nurturing. To any onlooker, it was a delightful paradox - an engaging mix of carefree childhood and a mock rehearsal of adult responsibilities. A satisfied smile adorned her face as she inspected her work, the doll dress was now \\"wrinkle-free\\" in her world. Her creative play-pretend was now complete, the royal garments of her doll having undergone the required preparation for a grand adorning. However, it was in these moments of pretend play that she was not only living her full imaginative potential but also unwittingly focusing on her cognitive development - hand-eye coordination, problem-solving, role-playing, understanding cause and effect. To the untrained eye, it was whimsical child's play, but to the discerning, it was the foundation of her learning and development. Thus, with each pretend press of her toy iron, this little baby was not merely playing, but paving her own unique learning journey, a testament to the potential and promise every child carries in them, waiting to be nurtilled and discovered. She moves on to the next 'task' in her play-pretend course, leaving a heartwarming trace of innocence blended with eagerness and a glimpse of the empowered individual she could grow up to embody."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

He took three solutions to identify them correctly, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sample would have lower concentration of hydronium ions, sample A or sample B? A:","output":"Sample B would have a lower concentration of hydronium ions compared to sample A. The reason behind this lies in the differences in the strengths of the acids and how they dissociate in water. An acid is considered strong if it completely ionizes (dissociates) in water, releasing all of its H+ ions. In the case of strong acids, the concentration of hydronium (H3O+) ions in the solution will be equal to the initial concentration of the acid, as every acid molecule releases a hydrogen ion. Therefore, strong acids have a higher concentration of hydronium ions in the solution, making them highly reactive. Examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and nitric acid (HNO3). In this case, sample A is a strong acid; thus, it has a relatively high concentration of hydronium ions. On the other hand, weak acids do not dissociate completely in water. Only a small percentage of their molecules release H+ ions. This leads to a dynamic equilibrium between the ionized (H3O+ and its conjugate base) and non-ionized forms of the weak acid. Since not all of the acid molecules release hydrogen ions, the concentration of hydronium ions in a solution of a weak acid is lower compared to a solution of a strong acid at the same initial concentration. Examples of weak acids include acetic acid (CH3COOH), carbonic acid (H2CO3), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4). In this case, sample B is a weak acid, and therefore, it has a lower concentration of hydronium ions compared to sample A. In conclusion, sample B, being a weak acid, would have a lower concentration of hydronium ions than sample A, which is a strong acid."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraphs, some supporting facts and an answer of a question.

Wilshere has only appeared in 95 league games in the past five years. Article:","output":"Title: Jack Wilshere's Road to Recovery Amidst 'Brittle Ankles' Claims Introduction: Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere is no stranger to the trials and tribulations of injury layoffs. Throughout his career, Wilshere has been sidelined from the football pitch for a significant period, facing several injury woes. With the recent news of his ankle surgery and the ongoing controversy surrounding the notion of his 'brittle ankles,' this young star's journey back to the field is being fervently discussed both by fans and critics alike. Jack’s Recent Ankle Surgery: As the 22-year-old Arsenal Gunners' star continues his recovery from an ankle operation, he took to social media to share an update with his followers. Wilshere posted a picture of himself during the recovery process which showed him working diligently to regain his form and get back to playing as soon as possible. This comes after a tackle from Manchester United's Paddy McNair last Saturday resulted in yet another injury that sidelined the young talent. Disputing the 'Brittle Ankles' Accusation: Wilshere’s most recent surgery has sparked the claims that he has 'brittle ankles,' an aspect that seems to be holding him back from realizing his full potential on the football field. Wilshere responded to these claims, denying that his ankles were inherently weaker than those of other footballers, and emphasized that this issue is rather a result of his determined playing style and relentless approach to the game. This tenacity on the pitch, while admirable, has unfortunately led to a series of injuries that have become something of a pattern in his career. Extended Recovery Time: Surgery on his ankle means that Wilshere will be unable to make a return to competitive football until at least February next year. This news has come as a blow to both the player and his club, as they face a tumultuous season filled with challenges and stiff competition. With the midfielder's experience and impact on the team now potentially compromised, it is yet another setback in his career that has seen him miss a staggering 119 weeks in total due to various injuries. Chronic Injury Struggles: Looking back into Jack Wilshere's history, it is disheartening to see that this young footballer has only made 95 league appearances in the past five years. When considering his substantial talent and potential, his career has been undoubtedly marred by the sheer amount of time spent off the pitch tending to numerous injuries, which many can't help but question whether this has stifled his growth as a player. Conclusion: Jack Wilshere’s ongoing injury struggles and the 'brittle ankles' controversy have put him under intense scrutiny and, at times, criticism. However, what remains evident is the resilience and determination he showcases whenever faced with adversity. As he begins his recovery process yet again, the football world waits with bated breath for the comeback of this young star, hoping that he can overcome these obstacles and reach the heights which his immense potential demands. The coming months will be crucial as Wilshere’s recovery unfolds, and the Arsenal midfield dynamo will have to prove his worth once he returns to the pitch. The unwavering support of fans and the determination to regain his place at the top are undoubtedly two factors driving Jack Wilshere to battle through his current tribulations and put to bed the rumors of his 'brittle ankles.'"},{"instruction":"Late Spring () is a 2014 South Korean romance melodrama starring Park Yong-woo, Kim Seo-hyung and Lee Yoo-young.

Here, \\"prin\\" is a Romanian preposition which is used similarly to the English \\"by\\" to indicate means or methods. - \\"Carrying educational messages\\" is translated to \\"care transmit mesaje educaționale\\". Romanian uses the relative pronoun \\"care\\" (which) to create relationships between phrases, similar to English. \\"Transmit\\" is used in the same context as \\"carry\\" in this case. - \\"Dazzling costumes and scenery\\" is translated to \\"costume și scenografii uluitoare\\". \\"Și\\" is the Romanian equivalent of \\"and\\".

There are 92 students altogether, and 20 of them ride the school bus home. So, we subtract 20 from 92 to find the remaining students who don't ride the school bus home. 92 - 20 = 72 students Step 2: Find the number of students who ride their own bike home. 5/8 of the remaining students (72) ride their own bikes home. So, we multiply the fraction 5/8 by 72 to find the number of students who ride their bikes home. (5/8) * 72 = 45 students Step 3: Find the number of students walking home. Now, we have determined the number of students who ride the school bus home (20 students) and those who ride their bikes home (45 students). To find out how many students walk home, we subtract these two numbers from the total number of students (92 students). 92 - 20 - 45 = 27 students Hence, the answer is justified, showing that 27 students are walking home."},{"instruction":"Question: What picked alex and his father up in the redesigned airplane?

Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw.

He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo.

The equation is 236*t + 192*t - 1704 = 144*t. We can see that there are three terms involving t. We'll combine those terms: (236*t + 192*t) - 1704 = 144*t 428*t - 1704 = 144*t Step 2: Isolate the variable t.

Static: This word is significant because it describes the type of shot being used in the context of photography or videography. A static shot is a shot where the camera remains stationary and does not move or pan while capturing the image or scene. This information is essential to understand the composition and nature of the shot. 2. Shot: The word \\"shot\\" is central to the sentence, as it represents the subject being discussed—a photographic or video frame. In photography and filmmaking, a shot refers to a single, continuous view taken by a camera without interruption. Understanding that we are talking about an image or scene framed by the camera is crucial to make sense of the sentence. 3. Framed: \\"Framed\\" is an essential term in the context, as it suggests how the shot will be visually composed. To frame something means to position specific elements within the shot in an aesthetically appealing manner, creating a pleasing and attention-catching presentation of the scene. In this case, it indicates that there exists a compositional element in the shot that impacts the visual experience. 4. Tree: Finally, \\"tree\\" is an important word, as it provides information about the specific element being used to frame the shot. It is a natural object that serves as a visual component within the scene, giving the viewer a sense of context, depth, and variety in the landscape.

The film is centered around a group of friends who get stranded in the open sea while on a yacht excursion. Amy (played by Susan May Pratt) is dealing with a childhood trauma involving water and is reluctant to leave the boat. Step 1: Briefly describe the critical event that leads to them being stranded During the movie, one of the friends, Zach, suggests that they all go swimming. They all jump into the water, forgetting to lower the yacht's ladder before getting off the boat. This leaves them stranded in the water with no way to get back on the boat. Step 2: Describe the progression of the story and the fates of the characters Throughout the film, the friends struggle with exhaustion, dehydration, panic, and some suffer from severe injuries. Dan (played by Eric Dane) is shown in several scenes sleeping or unconscious on the boat as the others struggle in the water. One by one, the characters face various fates: 1. Michelle drowns after exhaustion from swimming and trying to get back on the boat. 2. Lauren dies after falling from a makeshift rope that the group forms to reach the boat's railing. 3. James gets bitten by sharks and dies in Amy's arms. 4.

John is holding a poker night with his friends and is getting the decks of cards ready before his friends show up. After losing so many cards from various decks, John thinks he needs to count exactly how many cards he has to make sure he has enough full decks for the night. Each deck of cards should hold 52 cards. He finds 3 half-full decks of cards and 3 full decks of cards. As he is arranging them, he realizes that the quality of a lot of the cards is quite poor and decides to throw 34 of the cards in the trash. How many cards does John now have? Answer. 200 What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"Step 1: Determine how many cards are in the half-full decks. Since there are 3 half-full decks and each full deck has 52 cards, a half-full deck has 26 cards (52 / 2). So, 3 half-full decks have 26 * 3 = 78 cards. Step 2: Determine how many cards are in the full decks. Since there are 3 full decks and each has 52 cards, 3 full decks have 3 * 52 = 156 cards. Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards before removing the poor quality cards. Total cards = Cards in half-full decks + Cards in full decks Total cards = 78 + 156 = 234 cards Step 4: Subtract the number of poor quality cards that are thrown in the trash. Remaining cards = Total cards - Poor quality cards Remaining cards = 234 - 34 = 200 cards Thus, John now has 200 cards."},{"instruction":"Question 1: 1. If the atmosphere was much thicker than it is now, how would the sun appear? Question 2: How old do you have to be to volunteer for a political campaign? In 2018 I will be 15 years old. Will I be able to volunteer for midterm campaigns? Options are: [-] no. [-] yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: If the atmosphere was much thicker than it is now, how would the sun appear? If the atmosphere were much thicker than it currently is, several changes would occur that would affect the appearance of the sun. The overall density of the air would be higher, leading to increased scattering of the sunlight as it passes through the atmosphere. As a result, the sun would appear less intense and more diffuse or larger. Additionally, a thicker atmosphere would cause increased absorption of certain parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) light. This could result in a sun that appears more reddish in color, as shorter wavelengths of light (blue and green) would be scattered more effectively, leaving the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) to dominate. Lastly, the overall brightness of the sun might be reduced due to the larger amount of absorption and scattering of light by the atmosphere. The sky itself might appear more hazy, particularly during sunrise and sunset when the sun is low in the sky and its light has to pass through a greater amount of the atmosphere. Question 2: How old do you have to be to volunteer for a political campaign? In 2018 I will be 15 years-old. Will I be able to volunteer for midterm campaigns? The age at which someone can volunteer for a political campaign varies depending on the specific requirements of the campaign itself, as well as any legal requirements or restrictions. Generally, there is no federal legal age requirement for volunteering on political campaigns, but individual campaigns or local laws may have specific age requirements. In many cases, teenagers as young as 15 years old (like yourself) are able to volunteer for political campaigns, but the types of tasks or activities they can participate in may be limited. In some cases, volunteers under 18 may need parental permission or supervision. Overall, it is likely that you would be able to volunteer for midterm campaigns in some capacity as a 15-year-old, but you may need to check with the specific campaign or organization that you're interested in volunteering with to ensure you meet their requirements or guidelines. As for the answer to the two questions being the same, it is clear that the subjects of the questions are different and not directly related. The first question deals with the appearance of the sun if the Earth's atmosphere were to be thicker, while the second question pertains to eligibility to volunteer for a political campaign based on age. Therefore, the answers to these two questions would not be the same."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Physicist Lionel Barrett is enlisted by an eccentric millionaire, Mr. Deutsch, to make an investigation into \\"survival after death\\" in \\"the one place where it has yet to be refuted\\".

The house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits, the victims of Belasco's twisted and sadistic desires. Accompanying Barrett are his wife, Ann, as well as two mediums: a mental medium and Spiritualist minister, Florence Tanner, and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, who is the only survivor of an investigation 20 years previously. The rationalist Barrett is rudely sceptical of Tanner's belief in \\"surviving personalities\\", spirits which haunt the physical world, and he asserts that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of this energy. Though not a physical medium, Tanner begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Tanner may be using the house's energy against him.

Guidolin, 60, was appointed in January on a six-month contract after Alan Curtis' temporary spell in charge, with the club in the relegation zone. The Italian has led them to 11th place - 12 points clear of the bottom three, and they could finish in the top half. \\"Francesco fully deserves the chance to continue his good work into the new campaign,\\" chairman Huw Jenkins said. \\"He was prepared to come into the club at such a difficult time and put himself in a pressure situation with the club fighting for survival. \\"It's going to be another challenge for everyone, but we are looking forward to seeing how far he can take this squad of players over a full season. \\"There has obviously been a lot of speculation over recent weeks about a possible change of manager, but the board has been impressed with the way he has quietly gone about the job of improving performances and results since January.\\" The Italian members of Guidolin's backroom staff, Gabriele Ambrosetti and Diego Bortoluzzi, have also been offered new contracts. Swansea - who host Manchester City in their final game on Sunday - won seven matches and drew three of Guidolin's 15 games in charge. The former Udinese and Monaco head coach had previously said he wanted to continue in the role but would only discuss his future once Swansea had ensured safety. Swansea had hovered above the Premier League relegation zone for long periods of the campaign, but the 3-1 win against Liverpool on 1 May ensured a sixth season in the top flight. In March Guidolin was taken to hospital hours before Swansea's 2-1 win at Arsenal and also missed the 1-0 win over Norwich after receiving treatment for a chest infection. Former Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers, ex-Chile manager Marcelo Bielsa and former Derby County manager Paul Clement had all been linked with the job. Rodgers - who left to manage Liverpool in 2012 - disclosed in January that he had been approached by Swansea to succeed Garry Monk, who was sacked in December.

The victors ruled on Mt. Olympus and imprisoned the vanquished -- the Titans -- beneath Mt. Tartarus on Earth. Also lost during the battle is the Bow of Epirus, a mighty weapon that can shoot invincible energy arrows.Centuries later, King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) mounts a campaign to recover the Bow of Epirus and free the Titans. Bitter over the deaths of his wife and children due to disease, he is resolved to destroy the gods who refused his prayers to spare his family. He overtakes the Sybelline Monastery, imprisoning the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and her attendants, then lays waste to villages in the area. In one village works the stone mason Theseus (Henry Cavil). Theseus has been trained in the military arts by a mysterious Old Man (John Hurt) who encourages him to be a protector of all humanity; Theseus, whose devout mother was raped and thus considered an outcast, refuses. When the goddess Athena (Isabel Lucas) visits the Old Man, he is revealed to be Zeus (Luke Evans) in human disguise.When Hyperion's forces destroy Theseus's village, he kills Theseus's mother in front of him and imprisons Theseus, where Phaedra and her attendants are also kept. Phaedra inadvertently touches Theseus and has a vision of him as either the savior of humanity or the ally of Hyperion in the destruction of the world. That night, she and her attendants seduce and kill the guards; Phaedra escapes with Theseus and two other slaves, Stavros (Steven Dorff) and Daerios (Alan Van Spring).Although Zeus has forbidden the gods to intervene unless the Titans are freed, Athena, Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) and Ares (Daniel Sharman) determine to protect Theseus as best they can. Phaedra tells Theseus he must return to his village and properly bury his mother. There, Theseus discovers the Bow of Epirus. Hyperion has sent the Minotaur (Robert Maillet) and soldiers to intercept them. The soldiers kill Daerios but, after a brutal battle with the Minotaur, Theseus uses the Bow to... Answer:","output":"Considering the movie plot described, a suitable question could be: \\"How does Theseus' journey to accept his role as protector of humanity and his eventual acquisition of the Bow of Epirus affect the balance of power between the gods and the Titans, and how do the choices and actions of both divine and human characters contribute to the ultimate resolution of the conflict between King Hyperion and the inhabitants of the world?\\" This question addresses several key aspects of the plot, including the growth and development of Theseus' character as he takes on the responsibility to protect humanity, the influence and limitations placed on the gods in intervening in earthly matters, and the complex interplay between the desires of divine beings and the actions of mortal characters such as King Hyperion. Throughout the movie, Theseus' journey is shaped by both his internal struggles and external circumstances, including his training by the Old Man, who is later revealed to be Zeus in human disguise, the guidance he receives from Phaedra and her visions, and the tragic loss of his mother. As Theseus transforms from an outcast stone mason to a hero wielding the Bow of Epirus, his actions have far-reaching consequences that impact not only the lives of those around him but also the fate of the gods and the Titans. Simultaneously, the gods' inability to intervene in earthly affairs, barring the release of the Titans, adds an element of tension and urgency to the storyline. Despite their limitations, Athena, Poseidon, and Ares find ways to support Theseus covertly. This dynamic highlights the complex relationship between divine beings and mortals and the consequences of their actions on the larger narrative. Furthermore, the question recognizes the destructive role of King Hyperion, whose quest to obtain the Bow of Epirus and release the Titans reflects the escalating stakes of the movie plot. Through exploring the interplay between the divine and the human, this question encourages deeper examination of the relationship between fate and free will, as well as the consequences that arise from the choices made by these characters. Overall, this question offers a multifaceted exploration of the movie's themes, character development, and the intertwining struggles of gods, Titans, and mortals in a world fraught with conflict and power struggles."},{"instruction":"Write an email with the subject line \\"Energy Committee Minutes from January 23rd\\".","output":"Step 1: Writing the subject line Since the user has provided the subject line as \\"Energy Committee Minutes from January 23rd\\", I will use the same subject for the email.

Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \\"Pata Pata\\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".\\"? Answer:","output":"Question: In the passage, how does Burke view Jean-Jacques Rousseau's character, his influence on the French Revolution, and the contradictions between his theories and actions? Answer: In the passage, Burke seems to have a predominantly negative view of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's character and his influence on the French Revolution. He accuses Rousseau of being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France, which implies that Burke sees Rousseau as a key figure in shaping the revolution, possibly in a harmful way. While Burke acknowledges that Rousseau sometimes exhibited \\"a considerable insight into human nature,\\" he primarily focuses on the negative aspects of Rousseau's character and ideas. Burke criticizes Rousseau for having no guiding principles other than vanity, to the extent that it bordered on madness. This criticism suggests that Burke does not see Rousseau as a reliable or reasonable source of political or philosophical ideas. Moreover, Burke highlights the contradictions between Rousseau's theories and his personal actions, using the example of Rousseau's concept of universal benevolence versus his decision to send his own children to a foundling hospital. By making this contrast, Burke portrays Rousseau as a hypocrite who preaches ideas to others but fails to apply these ideas to his own life. Burke's statement that Rousseau was \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\" further emphasizes his belief in the inconsistency between Rousseau's theories and actions. Overall, the passage suggests that Burke sees Rousseau as a negative influence on the French Revolution, tainted by an inflated sense of self-importance, irrationality, and hypocrisy."},{"instruction":"This is a test of commonsense with single/multi-choices.

You can hang the border immediately below the ceiling or crown molding, along the top or bottom third of the wall, or halfway down a wall. Choose the location based on your preferences. Select from the following. * You can hang in a crawl space, or underneath furniture to provide privacy while decorating. Place one end of the border in the corner. * Clean the area where you want to hang your wallpaper. Use soapy water to thoroughly clean the area where you want to hang the wallpaper. * Instead of hanging your border at the top or the bottom of the wall, hang your border from the crown molding. This way you can see the whole room. * For example, if you are hanging a poster of eiffel tower and you simply wish to bring an original icon into your room, you may hang on the front or rear of the wall. If you are hanging a more contemporary hanging, you may want to place your hanging border across the top and bottom third of the wall. The answer is:","output":"Clean the area where you want to hang your wallpaper. Use soapy water to thoroughly clean the area where you want to hang the wallpaper. Explanation: The correct answer is to clean the area where you want to hang the wallpaper because a clean surface will help the wallpaper adhere better to the wall. - Hanging in a crawl space or under furniture doesn't make sense, because the purpose of wallpaper is to decorate a visible area of the wall, not to provide privacy. - Hanging the border from the crown molding is similar to hanging it just below the ceiling, which was already mentioned in the question. - The option about the poster of the Eiffel tower is irrelevant to hanging border wallpaper and doesn't provide useful information about how to hang it properly."},{"instruction":"Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy Attacks Republican Peers Governors tend to pull their punches when it comes to criticizing their peers. Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy is playing a different game. Attacking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie by name, taking a shot at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s concern over terror attacks in Milwaukee, and mocking Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s presidential aspirations, the New England Democrat has no qualms about taking the fight to the GOP. “Such a charitable man,” Malloy said of Christie, with a proverbial tongue in his cheek. “He has spread goodwill to so many places. He’s really quite remarkable, isn’t he.” Moments earlier, in an interview with TIME on Thursday, he muffled a laugh as he described Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose remarks he once called “the most insane statement I’ve ever heard,” as the “toughest one to beat in the Republican field.” Seizing an opportunity in a party depleted of household names not Clinton or Obama, Malloy is rising to the occasion, positioning himself as one of the party’s top attack dogs as the 2016 cycle approaches. But Malloy is also envisioning a larger role for himself within the party too. Addressing the winter meeting of the Association of State Democratic Chairs Thursday he delivered a fiery speech, imploring the party to refocus on its core values. “When we run as Republican-lite we lose,” he said. “Let us be Democrats once again,” he added, earning a standing ovation and whooping cheers. Malloy was one of the few Democratic success stories of 2014, expanding his margin of victory in a repeat of his 2010 grudge match with Republican Tom Foley. He holds up his support of gun control laws and minimum wage hikes as a model for other Democrats. As the chair-designate of the Democratic Governors Association, it will be Malloy’s job next year to try to pick up seats from Republicans, who now hold a near-record 31 governorships. Speaking to TIME, Malloy wasn’t shy about attacking his GOP colleagues, and expanded on his call for the Democratic Party to stop being “Republicans-lite.” Below is a lightly edited and condensed transcript: Gov. Dan Malloy: My message is first of all we’ve got to elect a democratic president. Otherwise the hard fought gains that we made under this president will be swept away. We’ve got to begin the process of changing the Congress and each election we need to pick up seats and we need to be on the offensive. What I’m hoping to do is see Democrats get elected. That’s what I’m trying to contribute to. TIME: But you’re saying the right type of Democrat, right? Malloy: I think any Democrat is better. But I think what my message is, it’s about running as a Democrat. It’s about talking about Democratic values. I think we have to talk about Democratic values in this country again, because I think Republicans and their allies on Fox and elsewhere have done a good job of confusing people about who is actually pulling for them. You know and I know and economists know that trickle-down economics doesn’t work. But we’ve got all kinds of people in this country who are confused by what they hear on fox everyday or elsewhere everyday and actually believe that somehow that’s going to trickle down to them even though during the last 25-30 years when trickle-down has been so often rolled out by Republicans, the middle class has not gotten bigger, wages are not up, quality of life for many of our citizens is not increasing the way that it should. So I think we need to be talking about our values versus their values. Listen, I’ve got rich friend. I don’t mind the rich getting richer, but the poor shouldn’t be getting poorer and there should be more people moving into the middle class. TIME: Are some Democrats in Washington not doing enough of that? Did that contribute to the defeats in 2014? Malloy: I think there are a lot of people who consciously or unconsciously, ran away from the president and the ideals of the party, and I’m not going to name names, but I think it’s important that we do what Republicans do, and view elections as a portion of the continuum, not as a stand-alone event. And every election needs to be built in part on the prior one and every new success needs to be built upon a prior success. And if we do that I think we’ll be stronger. TIME: Looking ahead to 2016, should there be other Democrats entering the race to have this sort of dialogue? Malloy: That’s up to other people. I think people have to make their decisions about whether they want to run. I think there are a lot of Democrats who want Hillary to run and I think she would be an extremely strong candidate for the nomination and to be elected. I’m glad we don’t have 23 people running for president right now, although, as I said, I think the toughest one to beat would be Bobby Jindal. So we have to worry about him. People are either going to run for president or not, she’s going to either run for president or not, I think it looks more and more like that she’s going to, but she’ll cross that bridge when she gets to it. TIME: Have you ever given it any thought? Malloy: No. Whenever people say you should president, I say, ‘I thought you liked me.’ Listen, I thought being mayor of Stamford was a wonderful job. Being governor of a state for a period of time is a wonderful job, and I’m not sure I’m at all attracted to Washington. TIME: Gov. Chris Christie to your south seems to be having a bit of a rough turn. Malloy: Such a charitable man. He has spread goodwill to so many places. He’s really quite remarkable, isn’t he. TIME: He’s been facing some budget issues and dealing with pension reform… Malloy: Dealing with pension reform. He’s in the process of destroying public pensions, which by the way comes out of the Republican playbook. He hasn’t told the truth about what he’s doing, but that’s what he’s doing. The level of defunding that’s taken place under his administration is remarkable and I think the state’s bond rating will pay perhaps not a permanent price, but a longterm price. He’ll saddle that problem to some unfortunate Democrat who’s going to have to come in and do the right thing. That’s the hard part about being a Democrat, you have to clean up after Republicans. TIME: Are you concerned that momentum Republicans are showing? Malloy: Yeah, that’s why I gave a speech. That’s why I think we have to rise as Democrats. I understand that everybody’s got to make tough choices in elections, but to defund your pension system by billions and billions of dollars, which is what New Jersey has done is not the right thing to do. To take away people’s rights to collectively negotiate their contracts, that’s not the right thing to do. And neither one of those things is going to help the middle class of those states. It’s just not going to. In some states it works to bash people who are a little bit better off than you to maybe make you feel better, but it is not a proven way to raise up the middle class, to raise the size of the middle class or to raise people’s standards of living. TIME: On gun control, do you see a path to revitalizing the national conversation around gun control? Malloy: There will be more and more events like Sandy Hook. Look at the number of children that have been killed in schools since Sandy Hook. I’ve stopped counting, it’s astronomical when you think about the killing of children or babies. This discussion is not done. People actually understand that mentally ill people should not be able to buy guns, that people with violent felony backgrounds should not be able to buy guns. They understand that. It’s when the other side wraps it with rhetoric like ‘they want to take your gun away.’ Well, no one wants to take your gun away, unless you’re, you know, a violent felon or you’re mentally ill, or you’ve threatened someone with it. That’s not happening anywhere. This conversation’s going to play out over a long period of time, and then the states that have done something about it, like my state, we continue to see a precipitous drop in homicides, and crime falling in Connecticut at three times the national average. TIME: Where do you stand on the legalization of marijuana? Malloy: That’s not something I’m interested in. I decriminalized marijuana. We have 6,000 fewer arrests as a result of decriminalizing it, and we passed medical marijuana and I’m comfortable with where we are. I think it would be a mistake to become involved in the sale of marijuana for income purposes. It should be a standalone decision, it shouldn’t be based on whether you’re going to get a little money for it. TIME: You’re taking over as chair of the DGA next year, what are you hoping to accomplish? Malloy: There are not a lot of Democratic governors, and we need to go our and fight the fight and take some of those states back and lay the groundwork for taking others back four years from now. I’ve always played a leadership role in any organization I’ve been apart of and I certainly have been the beneficiary of other governors, so I want to pay that back. I think this is important work. I think what Republicans pulled off in state legislatures following the Census and their wins in 2010 has been very hurtful to the country. We have too few districts in the country that are in play, and as a result the Congress of the United States doesn’t do what it was intended to do, and that is to actually represent the majority will of the people. They’ve in other words, been gerrymandered. TIME: Do you plan to step up your role in the party? Malloy: Obviously I’m here, and I was asked to speak, and there weren’t a whole lot of wins, so they’ve asked me to participate. And yes I’m going to play a role in trying to get more people elected as Democrats to the Houses and Senates and Assemblies, and more governors, and I’m on the lookout for good candidates for governor in the 2016 cycle. Some of those are pretty well set and some of those are going to be pretty wide open. TIME: Have you started the recruitment process? Malloy: We are engaged in the recruitment process. That begins with talking to people who are expressing interest and making sure that people understand what it is to be a candidate in a statewide election. You have a lot of folks who want to run who’ve never run statewide and it’s not an easy thing to do. Part of our job is to make sure people understand and are sufficiently committed to doing that. TIME: What are your thoughts on the Republican governors who have warned about the threat of ISIS as their party is embroiled in a shutdown fight over the Department of Homeland Security. Malloy: Those Republican governors should talk to the Republican members of Congress who are threatening to defund the agency that they are otherwise relying on. You know, it’s a wonderful thing, Republicans have both sides of their mouth and they’re able to use them well. The governor complains that there is a threat of ISIS in Milwaukee, but the Republican members of the Congress vote against funding the agency that’s charged with protecting us from it because they have a disagreement with the president over the ability of the people who were brought to this country as children and who have graduated from our school systems, to stay in this country. When they only speak English. That’s what this fight’s about. Republicans—they want to have both sides of the immigration issue, they want to have both sides of the job issue, they want to have both sides of the healthcare issue, and it’s incumbent on some of us not to let them get away with it. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy's combative approach toward his Republican peers, putting himself in the spotlight by attacking them by name and challenging their political ideals. Malloy, as a rising figure within the Democratic party, is positioning himself as a top attack dog, envisioning a larger role for himself within the party. In addition to his criticism of Republican policies, Malloy is also vocal about his support of gun control laws and minimum wage hikes. Malloy expresses the need for the Democratic party to refocus on its core values and actively fight against the influence of the Republican party. He emphasizes the importance of talking about Democratic values and countering the misleading messages spread by Republicans and their allies. Malloy aims to strengthen the Democratic party by helping to elect more Democrats into Houses, Senates, Assemblies, and Governors’ seats.

Think of it as a way to make talking a little bit faster or writing a little bit shorter. The phrases \\"not to\\" and \\"to not\\" are a bit tricky. They can mean the same thing depending on the sentence, but their proper use depends on the sentence structure. For example, \\"I decided not to go to the park.\\" In this case, \\"not to\\" is correct because it follows the word 'decided' and explains what you decided against. But if we say, \\"To not go to the park was a hard decision\\", this time 'to not' is correct because the phrase 'to go to the park' is considered together as a thing that's hard to decide against.

Passage: Established on Kīlauea in 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO), presently a branch of the United States Geological Survey, is the primary organization associated with the monitoring, observance, and study of Hawaiian volcanoes. Thomas A. Jaggar, the observatory's founder, attempted a summit expedition to Mauna Loa to observe its 1914 eruption, but was rebuffed by the arduous trek required (see Ascents). After soliciting help from Lorrin A. Thurston, in 1915 he was able to persuade the US Army to construct a \\"simple route to the summit\\" for public and scientific use, a project completed in December of that year; the Observatory has maintained a presence on the volcano ever since.Eruptions on Mauna Loa are almost always preceded and accompanied by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring of which was the primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by more than a year of seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.The modern monitoring system on Mauna Loa is constituted not only by its locally seismic network but also of a large number of GPS stations, tiltmeters, and strainmeters that have been anchored on the volcano to monitor ground deformation due to swelling in Mauna Loa's subterranean magma chamber, which presents a more complete picture of the events proceeding eruptive activity. The GPS network is the most durable and wide-ranging of the three systems, while the tiltmeters provide the most sensitive predictive data, but are prone to erroneous results unrelated to actual ground deformation; nonetheless a survey line across the caldera measured a 76 mm (3 in) increase in its width over the year preceding the 1975 eruption, and a similar increase in 1984 eruption. Strainmeters, by contrast, are relatively rare. The Observatory also maintains two gas detectors at Mokuʻāweoweo, Mauna Loa's summit caldera, as well as a publicly accessible live webcam and occasional screenings by interferometric synthetic aperture radar imaging.

Cars: This word is crucial because it reveals the subject of the sentence. By understanding that the sentence is centered around 'cars,' we can deduce that the sentence is about a specific type of vehicle, rather than people or animals. 2. Wait: This word indicates the action being performed by the cars. It tells the reader that the vehicles in question are not currently moving but are instead stationary in anticipation of something. 3. Corner: This word provides important information about the location of the waiting cars. It establishes that the cars are not waiting just anywhere, but specifically at the corner, which implies an intersection or a point where two roads meet. 4. Thursday: Lastly, this word introduces a time element into the sentence. It tells us when the event – the cars waiting at the corner – is happening. This piece of information adds more context and helps the reader understand that the event occurs on a specific day of the week, rather than any random day."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where could you find a steel cable that has not been completed yet? Possible A: winch, factory, roller coaster, ship, building Why is \\"factory\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Factory\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because a steel cable that has not been completed yet would most likely be found in the manufacturing process, which takes place in a factory or an industrial facility. In a factory, steel cables are produced by drawing, stranding, and closing processes where steel wires are twisted together to form a strong cable. Factories often have specialized machinery and equipment for these processes, and have multiple stages of production where steel cables are made, tested, and stored before being sent out for various applications. Since the question specifies that the steel cable \\"has not been completed yet,\\" it implies that the cable is still in the creation or assembly process, which is most commonly found in a factory setting. Other options such as winch, roller coaster, ship, or building usually involve steel cables that have already been manufactured and are being used for their intended purpose, thus not aligning with the notion of an incomplete or unfinished steel cable."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Esta es una oración en español.

Firstly, both sentences claim that a deal would result in increased 2004 earnings for PeopleSoft, excluding amortization and other items.

Of these, bamboo, botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material in their own right and, these days, in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and veneer. Another major plant group that produce material that often is called wood are the palms. Of much less importance are plants such as Pandanus, Dracaena and Cordyline. With all this material, the structure and composition of the structural material is quite different from ordinary wood.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"One non-dicot and non-bamboo plant that is also an important producer of wood-like material is palm. Palm trees, belonging to the Arecaceae family, produce a structural material that is often called palm wood, which has various applications and economic importance in areas where they are abundant."},{"instruction":"Do the following sentences say the same thing?

Return your answer on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\".","output":"To determine the similarity between these two sentences, let's break down their key components step by step: 1. Both sentences discuss legislation that would change the state's takeover law. 2. Both sentences mention the legislation will help a company fend off a takeover. 3. The first sentence references a Michigan-based development company, while the second sentence specifically names Bloomfield Hills-based Taubman Centers Inc., which is also a Michigan-based development company. 4. The first sentence states that the legislation cleared the state Senate, while the second sentence states that it won committee approval. Based on these observations, we can see that the two sentences discuss the same topic, covering the same legislation and its intent to help a Michigan-based company. However, there are some differences in the specific details of each sentence, such as the progression of the legislation (cleared state Senate vs. won committee approval) and mentioning the company's name. Considering these similarities and differences, I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as a 4 on a scale from 0 to 5. The content and intention of the sentences are very similar, but there are some minor differences in details."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: So this thing happened today. I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Diamond Masi live in the slums Options: - she was poor - not enough information - she was born there - her relatives were there Answer:","output":"- she was poor"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family, and consequently the new wing, designed by Edward Blore, was built by Thomas Cubitt, enclosing the central quadrangle.

Brady, who lost a bid to move from a secure hospital to a prison at a mental health review in 2013, wanted to challenge a ban on Robin Makin representing him at a future tribunal. Mr Makin's solicitors' firm, E Rex Makin & Co, is not a member of the Law Society's mental health panel. The case was dismissed as \\"unarguable\\". Sitting at London, Mr Justice Morris said Brady's challenge had \\"no realistic prospect of success\\". He added that nothing in the European Convention on Human Rights or in case law \\"supports the proposition that in civil proceedings... there is a right to publicly-funded representation for a lawyer of choice\\". Image caption Solicitor Robin Makin has represented Brady in the past At the 2013 mental health review tribunal in Manchester, 79-year-old Brady asked to be moved to a Scottish prison from Merseyside's Ashworth Hospital so he could not be force-fed and could be allowed to die if he wishes. The request was rejected after medical staff said Brady had chronic mental illness and needed continued care at the secure unit. Brady refused to take part in a further review in September 2016 on the grounds that Mr Makin could not be involved. Under legal aid rules, only members of the Law Society's mental health panel are entitled to a publicly-funded contract. ||||| Margaret Thatcher intervened to keep the Moors murderers in prison and dubbed their crimes “the most hideous and evil in modern times”, The Telegraph can reveal. A new archived document never before seen in public has been uncovered showing the Tory prime minister demanding the killers stayed incarcerated for “ever”. Mrs Thatcher also ordered extra security for Ian Brady when he was being transferred into a new prison “to make doubly sure that this maniac cannot escape”. ||||| Serial killer took action after his solicitor was denied legal aid contract to represent him in attempt to move to a Scottish prison Moors murderer Ian Brady has been refused permission to launch a high court battle to get a lawyer of his choice to represent him at a tribunal. Brady applied to launch what his lawyers described as a “totally unique” legal case after his solicitor of more than 25 years, Robin Makin, was denied a legal aid contract to represent him in his attempt to move to a Scottish prison. In 2013, the serial killer, 79, who now uses the name Ian Stewart-Brady, appeared before the mental health review tribunal asking to be moved to a prison in Scotland – where he was born and brought up – so he would not be force fed and could be allowed to die. Scottish prisons do not force feed inmates. His request to transfer was rejected after Ashworth hospital on Merseyside – where he is currently a patient – said he had chronic mental illness and needed continued care. A further review of the case was scheduled to take place in September last year, but Brady refused to take part unless his lawyer of choice could represent him. Brady and Myra Hindley were convicted of luring children and teenagers to their deaths. The couple’s victims were sexually tortured before being buried on Saddleworth Moor. Hindley died in hospital, still a prisoner, in November 2002 at 60. Makin is currently barred from acting as Brady’s publicly funded legal representative because his solicitors’ firm, E Rex Makin & Co, is not a member of the Law Society’s mental health panel. Under legal aid rules, only members are entitled to a publicly funded contract in the mental health law category. After a hearing held in London last week, Justice Morris on Monday dismissed Brady’s application for permission to seek judicial review, ruling that it had “no realistic prospect of success”. Morris said nothing in the European convention on human rights or in case law supported “the proposition that in civil proceedings, in particular proceedings related to detention on the grounds of mental health, there is a right to publicly funded representation for a lawyer of choice”. Brady’s legal team, who say the prisoner has been bedridden for the last couple of years, argued that the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, should use her powers to “make arrangements” in the case because it was so unique. However, Morris said it would not be a “lawful and proper use of her power” for her to intervene. Lawyers acting for Brady have described him as terminally ill. “He is in very poor physical health – he suffers from emphysema and has constant oxygen and a nebuliser four times a day,” they said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A man named Ian Brady, who did some very bad things a long time ago, wanted a certain lawyer to represent him at a special meeting called a tribunal.

Answer: There could be several reasons for a person to be on top of a pole, taking into consideration that not all poles are electric ones and not every person on top of a pole is a construction worker. 1. Maintenance or repair work: A person might be on top of a pole to fix or replace a broken component, be it an electric pole, a telecommunication pole, or a streetlight pole. They could be a technician or a utility worker assigned to carry out this task. 2. Installation: A person might be installing new equipment, like a security camera or a banner/advertisement on a non-electric pole. They could be working in the fields of advertising, event management, or surveillance. 3. Sports and recreation: Some sports and outdoor recreational activities involve climbing poles, including pole fitness, pole vaulting, and various obstacle course challenges. In these cases, the person on top of the pole could be an athlete, a fitness enthusiast, or a participant in a team-building exercise. 4. Performance arts: Aerialists and circus performers might be on top of a pole as part of an act or routine, demonstrating their skills in acrobatics, dance, or balancing. 5. Rescue operations: Emergency responders, such as firefighters or animal rescue personnel, may need to climb poles to reach stranded individuals or animals, especially in situations where the use of aerial equipment like a ladder may not be possible or practical.

The term comes from the Russian verb (\\"dumat\\") meaning \\"to think\\" or \\"to consider\\". The first formally constituted duma was the State Duma introduced into the Russian Empire by Tsar Nicholas II in 1906. It was dissolved in 1917 during the Russian Revolution. Since 1993, the State Duma is the lower legislative house of the Russian Federation. - Russia is not proportionately populated between the smaller western portion (almost 25%) of the country that is considered part of Europe, and the larger eastern portion (more than 75%) that is part of Asia. European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 million km (1.54 million mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia. - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government. - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow. - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area.

Originally a supporter of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yeltsin emerged under the perestroika reforms as one of Gorbachev's most powerful political opponents. During the late 1980s, Yeltsin had been a member of the Politburo, and in late 1987 tendered a letter of resignation in protest. No one had resigned from the Politburo before. This act branded Yeltsin as a rebel and led to his rise in popularity as an anti-establishment figure. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg.

Options: - excel in soccer - do well - read books - amount to - better comprehension Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"If a student works hard, they are generally expected to perform well academically and possibly in other areas, depending on where the effort is focused. Here's a brief analysis of all the provided options: 1. Excel in soccer: Although hard work can lead to improved performance in sports, particularly if the student is focused on practicing and improving their soccer skills. However, hard work in general or academically might not necessarily correlate to excelling in soccer, since it's not directly related to their studies. 2. Do well: This is the most applicable option, as working hard usually translates to better performance. If the student's efforts are concentrated on their academic responsibilities or a specific subject, they are expected to achieve higher grades, better understanding, and overall success as a result of their diligence. 3. Read books: Although working hard might involve reading books as a means of acquiring knowledge, the mere act of reading books doesn't necessarily encapsulate the improvements the student may experience as a result of their hard work. 4. Amount to: This phrasing is somewhat vague, but the essence of it is that if a student works hard, they are likely to achieve more, be it in academic, extracurricular, or personal pursuits. However, the more conventional way to express this idea is \\"achieve more\\" or \\"succeed.\\" 5. Better comprehension: Another potential outcome of a student working hard is enhanced comprehension, which is a direct result of their dedication to learning. This improved understanding then becomes a major factor in their overall performance in tests, assignments, and projects. In conclusion, based on the options provided and the step-by-step reasoning, the most expected outcome of a student working hard is that they \\"do well\\" in their studies or endeavors."},{"instruction":"Q:Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters.

Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities.

On the same programme, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox did not reveal his stance on the customs union, which sets standard tariffs EU-wide. He said he was \\"a free trader\\", but the government would reach a view. Staying a member of the customs union would, however, mean \\"limitations\\" on the UK's ability to set its own trade tariffs, which would in turn limit the kind of deals it could do with the rest of the world, Mr Fox added. Who has access to the single market? What are the UK's post-Brexit trade options? Mr Osborne, who argued for Remain, said it was essential that close relations with countries such as France and Germany were not sacrificed in pursuit of new trade deals with other nations including China. He told the Andrew Marr Show: \\"Yes it's true the grass may be greener outside of these arrangements and we may be able to conduct new trade deals with the United States, Australia and so on. \\"But that shouldn't come at a price of giving up existing free trade agreements we have with Germany and France. \\"You can't say we are a beacon of free trade in the world and then the main thing you achieve is a huge act of protectionism, the biggest in British history.\\" Mr Osborne - who lost his job in the cabinet after the referendum - admitted the Remain campaign lacked \\"some of the authenticity and optimism\\" of the Leave camp, and focused too much on dire predictions. \\"We discovered there was not much out there in terms of support for European friendship and so we ended up talking a lot about the economy and, as chancellor, of course, I was centre stage in that.\\" He also said the pledge to get net migration down to the tens of thousands \\"damaged\\" the government in the referendum because \\"we didn't really have an answer\\" when challenged on why it had been missed. Mr Osborne said he hoped the predictions he made about the economy post-Brexit turn out \\"not to be true.\\" But he told the programme he would \\"wait and see what happens\\" as the pound had fallen sharply since the referendum and Britain was \\"poorer as a result\\". Also speaking to Andrew Marr, Mr Fox said Brexit the question of the customs union was \\"not binary\\". \\"I hear people talking about hard Brexit and soft Brexit as though it's a boiled egg we are talking about, it's a little more complex. So, Turkey, for example, is in part of the customs union, but not in other parts.\\" Mr Osborne's appearance on the show marked his first TV interview since he was sacked by Prime Minister Theresa May. He said he had \\"learned a lot\\" during his time as chancellor and wanted to attempt to understand what he had got right and what went wrong. During the London 2012 Paralympics he was booed while handing out a medal, which he admitted \\"hurt\\", particularly as his children were in the crowd. But he added: \\"Sometimes those moments do help change you for the better.\\" He said his work trying to promote a Northern Powerhouse was also allowing him to travel around the country and attempt to \\"understand why people feel the system is not working for them\\". Earlier this week, the former chancellor told a Commons debate British MPs were deceiving themselves if they thought they did not have some responsibility for what had happened in Syria. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the perspectives of the UK's international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and former British Chancellor, George Osborne, on the EU customs union, in relation to Brexit. Fox did not disclose his position on keeping the UK in the customs union, which sets standard EU-wide tariffs. However, he mentioned that continuing as a member would constrain the UK's ability to set its own trade tariffs, and this could restrict what trade deals the UK could establish with countries outside the EU. In contrast, Osborne urged not to sacrifice relations with EU countries like France and Germany to pursue new trade agreements with nations like China. He added that abandoning existing free trade deals with Germany and France may symbolize the UK as a protectionist state, which could contradict its position as a proponent of global free trade. Further, Osborne admitted that the Remain campaign during the Brexit referendum lacked the authentic appeal of the Leave campaign. He also believed the government's commitment to reduce net migration to tens of thousands to have negatively impacted the referendum's outcome. He conveyed his hopes that the economic predictions he made regarding post-Brexit consequences are proved wrong, as the consequent sharp fall in the pound's value has made the UK poorer. Fox also compared Brexit with a complex situation rather than the simplistic views of a 'hard' or 'soft' Brexit, using Turkey as an example of a country that is part of some components of the customs union but not others. The article also covered Osborne's first television interview after his dismissal by the Prime Minister, Theresa May. During his interview, he reconciled with his past experiences as a chancellor and acknowledged his moments of criticism while recognizing his efforts to understand why people feel the societal system is not working for them. Furthermore, Osborne referred to the UK's collective responsibility over the crisis in Syria during a previous Commons debate."},{"instruction":"Cameron broke my leg by accident during the big basketball game.

He admired his firefighting friend so much that he gave the character his name. Mark Twain and Tom Sawyer had many adventures together, gambling in Nevada and drinking in pubs. Tom Sawyer once worked as a volunteer firefighter, policeman and customs officer. Before making his way out West, Tom Sawyer used his strength to save 90 people from a burning ship. Mark Twain was particularly moved by this story because his own brother died in a fire while working on a similar steamboat. The two men became friends immediately after meeting in 1863, with Tom Sawyer traveling to Virginia City, while Mark Twain was working as a reporter there. After one night they returned to San Francisco, Mark Twain told his friend that he would base a character in his yet-unwritten book on him. Tom Sawyer said, \\"One day he said to me, 'I'm going to put you between the covers of a book, Tom.' 'Go ahead, Sam,' I Said, 'but don't disgrace my name.'\\" Besides their fondness of drinking, the two men also shared a hobby for storytelling. Tom sawyer believed that it was his anecdotes about his own childhood that inspired Mark Twain to create a book on him. Finally Mark Twain said that the character of Tom sawyer was based on a mix of three real people---John B. Briggs, William Bowen and himself. In spite of this, the historical evidence shows that there might be a fourth, more prominent influencer. Which of the following is TRUE according to the text? A) Mark Twain wanted to be a firefighter after he knew Tom Sawyer. B) Tom Sawyer saved Mark Twain's life in a terrible fire C) Tom Sawyer's experience inspired Mark Twain to create a work.

As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

If you are Mohamed Ibrahim Makkawi, years of trouble and the shadow of a senior al Qaeda figure lurking over your every move. Makkawi's arrival at Cairo's airport Wednesday caused a brief flutter of excitement. Could it be that one of the most senior figures in al Qaeda had been detained in dramatic (and highly unlikely) fashion after stepping off an Emirates flight from Islamabad in Pakistan? The confusion arose because Saif al-Adel -- regarded as al Qaeda's third-most-senior figure -- had long been associated with an alias identical to Makkawi's name. The two men do have some common background. Both were Egyptian military officers who joined the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. Makkawi was a major and an explosives expert in Egypt's Special Forces. He went on trial in 1987 for his Islamist connections and was dismissed from the army. Both he and al-Adel -- then a lieutenant and apparently a more active militant -- left for Pakistan and joined Osama bin Laden's jihad. By 1988, Makkawi was fighting Soviet forces and their surrogates in Afghanistan.

The correct answer is \\"Egyptian Ministry of Interior confirmed that al-Adel was still at large.\\" This is because the confusion and excitement were at Cairo's airport in Egypt when Makkawi arrived. It would make sense that the Egyptian Ministry of Interior would be the one to confirm the status of al-Adel. The other options are incorrect for various reasons: - Most mention organizations or locations that have no direct relevance to the situation mentioned in the text (e.g. CNN, Islamabad, Emirates, Soviet, Special Forces, etc.). - Some options refer to individuals (e.g. Makkawi, Osama bin Laden, or al-Adel), which do not make sense as they cannot be the ones to confirm al-Adel's status. - The option \\"Interior Ministry Ministry of Interior\\" is incorrect due to redundancy and doesn't specify the country."},{"instruction":"Today, many academics feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Researchers found that writers who don't time-block their writing in advance probably: Options: A. not enough information B. Get all of their work done C. Feel like they're stuck D. Are more efficient than those that do time-block Answer:","output":"C. Feel like they're stuck"},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning? Born in New York City , he grew up in Athens , Greece , and then in North Grafton , Massachusetts . Born in Athens , Greece , he grew up in New York City and then in North Grafton , Massachusetts .","output":"No, these two sentences do not have the same meaning. In the first sentence, the person is born in New York City, and then grows up in Athens, Greece and finally in North Grafton, Massachusetts. This shows the sequential order of the places the person has lived starting from the place of birth. On the other hand, the second sentence tells us that the person is born in Athens, Greece and grows up in New York City, and then in North Grafton, Massachusetts. Here too, it shows the sequence of places where the person has lived. Given these conditions, we can say that the two sentences don't have the same meaning because the birthplace and the first place of growing up are swapped in the two sentences. The sequence of places this individual has lived in changes, which alters the biographical context and therefore, also the meanings of the two sentences."},{"instruction":"Translate from English to Spanish: Natural products in Piura, Peru - Amarillasperu.net","output":"Productos Naturales en Piura, Perú - Amarillasperu.net La región de Piura, en Perú, ofrece una gran variedad de productos naturales y autóctonos gracias a su diversidad climática y de ecosistemas, entre los que se encuentran los bosques secos, manglares, sabanas y áreas de cultivo.

The answer is:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what do fires ignited with fuel convert energy into?\\" is not \\"oil\\". The reason is that when we talk about fires ignited with fuel, we are referring to the process of combustion. Combustion is a chemical reaction that involves the rapid combination of a fuel source with an oxidizer, such as oxygen, producing energy in the form of heat and light. This is also known as an exothermic reaction, as it releases energy. Given that the provided question asks about the energy conversion in a fire ignited with fuel, it would be incorrect to answer \\"oil\\" because oil is not a product of energy conversion in this context. Instead, the correct answer would be that fires ignited with fuel convert energy into heat and light, as stated in the original information provided. Heat and light energy produced by fires are crucial for various applications in our everyday lives, such as cooking, heating, and industrial processes. Heat energy generated during combustion can be harnessed to produce steam, which can power turbines and generate electricity in power plants. On a smaller scale, we utilize the heat produced by burning fuel to cook our food and warm our homes. Light energy produced during combustion can be seen as the visible glow created by burning materials. This glow, or flame, is a result of excited molecules and atoms releasing energy in the form of light photons. Light emitted by fire has been essential throughout human history, providing illumination before the invention of artificial lights. In summary, fires ignited with fuel do not convert energy into \\"oil\\"; they convert energy into heat and light. This energy release is essential for various human activities, from heating our homes to powering large-scale industries. Understanding how combustion works and the energy conversion processes involved helps us use fire responsibly and efficiently to meet our needs."},{"instruction":"Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand. Question: After receiving help from Juliette Murray, most students probably: === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"After receiving help from Juliette Murray, most students probably: Have a more realistic understanding of the medical profession, and are better equipped to make informed decisions about pursuing a career in this field. By participating in authentic work experience, observing surgeries, and witnessing the pressures associated with being a doctor or surgeon, these students gain valuable exposure to the day-to-day responsibilities and challenges that come with working in healthcare. This hands-on approach not only helps them develop a deeper appreciation for the profession but also allows them to discover whether their interests and passions align with a career in medicine. Moreover, by targeting a more diverse and representative group of students for these experiences, Juliette Murray's efforts contribute to broadening the pool of potential future doctors, which may ultimately lead to a more inclusive and effective healthcare system."},{"instruction":"Peter Hartz, as chairman of a commission to overhaul Germany's economy, became synonymous with far-reaching, often unpopular, reforms.

Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings.

In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed. Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films. The answer is:","output":"The full name of the mother of the girl that the professor of French Literature is attracted to, in this article, is Charlotte Haze."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: You may know the song Happy Birthday very well.But do you know about its writer?It was written by an American girl.And she became very rich after that.

Madeline needs 1200 to pay rent, 400 for groceries, 200 for medical expenses, and 60 for utilities. She also wants to save 200 in case of an emergency. She makes 15 per hour at her job. How many hours will Madeline need to work this month?","output":"To determine how many hours Madeline needs to work this month, follow these steps: Step 1: Find the total amount Madeline needs for the month. Add up all of Madeline's expenses and desired savings: - Rent: 1200 - Groceries: 400 - Medical expenses: 200 - Utilities: 60 - Emergency savings: 200 1200 (rent) + 400 (groceries) + 200 (medical) + 60 (utilities) + 200 (savings) = 2060 So, Madeline needs a total of 2060 for this month. Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Madeline needs to work to earn the required amount. Madeline earns 15 per hour at her job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn 2060, divide her total needed amount by her hourly wage: 2060 ÷ 15 (hourly wage) = 137.3333 Since Madeline cannot work a fraction of an hour, she will need to work a whole number of hours. Therefore, round up the result to the next whole number: 137.3333 ≈ 138 hours Final Answer: Madeline needs to work 138 hours this month to cover her expenses and save 200 for emergencies."},{"instruction":"Output a stream of consciousness before answering the following.

Following the declaration of secession by South Carolina on December 20, 1860, its authorities demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor. On December 26, Major Robert Anderson of the U.S. Army surreptitiously moved his small command from the vulnerable Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress built on an island controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor. An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861.

Jillian Johnson thought she was doing everything right. She had read all the books and taken all the courses to prepare for the birth of her first child. She was encouraged to exclusively breastfeed, but just three days into her son Landon's short life, paramedics were called to her California home and her precious baby boy was put on life support. Jillian tells Be that she's telling her heartbreaking story to help other new parents, and in a moving blog post shared by the Fed is Best Foundation, she explains that she and her husband Jarrod had been ingrained with the motto “breast is best” and chose a “baby friendly” hospital – that is, one that encourages breastfeeding - to deliver their baby boy. Landon James was born via caesarean section on February 25, 2012, and went straight to breastfeeding, with Jillian told he had “a great latch and was doing fine”. One lactation consultant noted however, that Jillian may have trouble producing milk as she has been diagnosed with POCS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) and Landon was her first child. The other issue is that he was always crying. Newborn babies tend to feed and sleep, but Landon was constantly screaming - screaming and nursing. “Landon cried. And cried. All the time,” Jilian writes, “He cried unless he was on the breast and I began to nurse him continuously.” “The nurses would come in and swaddle him in warm blankets to help get him to sleep. And when I asked them why he was always on my breast, I was told it was because he was ‘cluster feeding’. “I recalled learning all about that in the classes I had taken, and being a first time mum, I trusted my doctors and nurses to help me through this – even more so since I was pretty heavily medicated from my emergency c-section and this was my first baby.” RELATED: Must read: The moving story of darling toddler Nate During his first 24 hours of life, Landon had spent nine hours nursing but had lost close to five per cent of his body weight. By the time another 26 hours had passed, that number had increased to almost 10 per cent. The Australian Breastfeeding Association says the general guidelines for newborns’ weight loss is that, “a baby loses 5-10 per cent of birth weight in the first week and regains this by 2-3 weeks.” However they stress that this is advice is general. As his weight loss was within a “normal” range, Jillian and Landon were discharged from hospital. “So we took him home….not knowing that after less than 12 hours home with us, he would have gone into cardiac arrest caused by dehydration,” she writes. Jillian found Landon unresponsive, pulseless and blue after he fell asleep following a feed. He was rushed to hospital and immediately taken to the neonatal intensive care unit where a devastated Jillian was told, “sure breast is best, but follow with the bottle. This way you know your baby has eaten enough.” “If only I could go back in time,” she writes. An MRI showed that Landon had suffered a brain injury caused by lack of oxygen due to dehydration, and his life support was turned off on March 15. “I still have many, many days of guilt and questions – what if I would’ve just given him a bottle? And anger because how would I have known.” Five years on from Landon's tragic death, Jillian and Jarrod have become parents to two gorgeous girls and celebrate their son's birthday every year. Jillian, who lives by the motto \\"be so busy loving your life you have no time for hate, regret or fear\\", tells Be, \\"we have two beautiful girls, Stella who will be four in March, and Aliona who is 18 months. \\"We talk about Landon all the time. We have pictures of him up throughout the house. Our girls know who he is and we celebrate his birthday and acknowledge him on holidays.\\" She is sharing her heartache in the hope that other new parents will find the information the need when breastfeeding. \\"I realised in my grieving that there could be so many more parents that needed to hear it or talk about it but were never given the opportunity,\\" she says. \\"I had the opportunity to get the dialogue started and it needed to be done. I only wish I did it sooner. I'm so grateful knowing there's a foundation dedicated to educating parents on the importance of feeding your newborn - whether supplementing or breastfeeding. I'm pro-feeding. Plain and simple,\\" she adds, referring to the Fed is Best Foundation. Better Health Victoria has more information on bottle and breastfeeding newborns, and you can call the Australian Breastfeeding Association’s mum’s helpline on 1800 686 268 seven days a week.

Johnson says she felt pressured by her baby-friendly hospital to exclusively breastfeed her son Landon. As a result, he did not get enough colostrum (a mother’s early milk) in the first days of life and suffered cardiac arrest from dehydration just 12 hours after being discharged from the hospital. “We had chosen to have Landon in a baby-friendly hospital — that means that everything is geared towards breastfeeding,” she tells PEOPLE Now. “All the classes that we took, whether it was breastfeeding classes, we had birth classes, we had Lamaze classes, all of them still pushed breastfeeding.” Johnson says she was made to feel that breastfeeding was the only option when it came to feeding her child. “I can’t even say that pressure is the right word,” she says. “Everything was pushed so hard, you felt brainwashed. You felt like you were a horrible person if you gave your baby a bottle, and you wanted to do everything you could to make sure that your baby was breastfed and not given a bottle.” The feelings of grief Johnson felt after losing her son to accidental starvation are hard for her to articulate. “It’s really not something I could put into words for somebody else to understand if they haven’t lost a child, but there’s a hole,” she says. “There’s a hole in our hearts. He can’t be replaced. He would have been 5, he would have been starting kindergarten this year. The holidays are really hard because, what would he dress up as for Halloween this year? What would we have gotten him for Christmas?” Johnson now has two children — Stella, almost 4, and Aliona, 18, months — whom she “combo fed” with a mix of breastfeeding and formula. She wrote about her experience for a blog post for the non-profit organization Fed Is Best to help educate other parents who may feel similar pressures to exclusively breastfeed. “There’s nothing wrong with giving your child a bottle,” she says. “In the end, what would you rather have – a child that passed away because you did your best to breastfeed him? Or would you like to raise your child, because you had no fear and gave the child a bottle? There is nothing wrong with supplementing. It comes down to making sure that your baby is getting everything that they need, even if it’s the first few days of life. I know women who have had to give them a bottle for the first few days and they didn’t have to give them a bottle after that.” Johnson says the reactions to her blog post have been mixed. “There’s definitely a lot of pushback as far as, why are we anti-breastfeeding?” she says. “We’re not anti-breastfeeding. If we were, our baby would still be alive. There are women and even their husbands who have come out and said, we went through this. We maybe didn’t lose our baby but we had to have our baby readmitted to the hospital, or it came close.” “When I say parents educate yourself, I’m talking to the dads too because you can’t not listen to those instincts,” she continues. “If you think something is wrong, push on those doctors and nurses as hard as you can to make sure, until you feel that you’re being taken care of, that baby’s being taken care of. Especially at that age, you’re the only advocate that baby has so you have to do everything in your power to make sure that baby’s taken care of.” In addition to being able to ask for support from doctors and nurses, Johnson says it’s important for the community to come together as a whole to support mothers, whatever their method of feeding may be. “As a community, we need to start taking care of each other,” she says. “The amount of moms that have said, ‘I needed to hear this so that I could speak up,’ it’s amazing, because we shouldn’t be shamed for how we choose to feed our children as long as they’re fed.” Five years after her son’s death, Johnson is still reeling from the loss, but hopes her story can help prevent similar deaths from occurring. “We have a candle for him that we light on holidays. For his birthday we always go to the same beach, we write his name in the sand during sunset,” she says. “We have two little girls now and they know about him. We talk about him, there are pictures of him in our home. He’s always going to be part of our lives. Now we just want to do bigger things in his name and help other parents prevent losing their babies.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A mom named Jillian Johnson wanted to share her story when her baby, Landon, sadly passed away.

Next, we'll gather some treats or toys: Before starting, we need some goodies that our doggie loves, like small tasty treats or their favorite toy. These treats or toys will help us get their attention and reward them when they focus on us. 2. Have your dog sit and show them the treats: Now, we ask our doggie to sit in the quiet place we chose. Show them the treat (or toy) so they know we have something they want. Remember, we want their full attention! 3. Get your dog's attention with a command: Use a word or phrase, like \\"look at me\\" or their name, and say it happily! We want them to hear the command and look at us right away. When they do, give them the treat and praise them in a super excited voice so they know they did a great job! 4. Practice, practice, practice: Keep doing this a few times every day. As our doggie friend gets better at focusing on us, we can try doing it in new places with more distractions. Each time they look at us when we say the command, give them a treat and lots of praise! 5. Slowly reduce treats and increase challenges: Over time, we want to give our dog fewer treats so they learn to focus even without goodies. Start by giving them a treat every few times they look at us after hearing the command. We can also start practicing in more distracting places, like the park, to help them get even better at focusing on us. By following these steps, our doggie learns to focus on us whenever we ask them to, making it easier to teach them new tricks and have more fun together!"},{"instruction":"If you are considering buying commercial properties in Dubai then it is prudent to do your research first .

Article: At a primary school in a small town in the east of South Carolina, second-grade teachers Carneau and Lynne are convinced that separating primary boys and girls produces immediate academic improvement in both genders David Chadwell, South Carolina's coordinator of single gender education says, \\" Boys and girls learn,hear and respond to their surroundings differently. We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.\\" Male and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \\" Boys interpret the world as objects moving through space,\\" he says. The male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention. Boys and girls also hear differently. \\" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \\" says Chadwell. \\" They think you're mad and can shut down. \\" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited. A boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious. These differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. \\" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning.\\" Question: Which of the students is most likely to stay focused? - A boy sitting in a warm room. - A standing boy faced with stress. - A girl standing in a cold room. - A girl facing a lot of pressure.

Only after he was all secure did he light a piece of burlap, put it in a tin smoker and start replacing the beehives in the rooftop garden at the Fairmont Hotel. Patrons of the hotel were none the wiser as thousands of bees swarmed the skyline just above Marshall’s head. It was business as usual for the hotel, for Marshall and for his bees. Marshall, 69, has worked with bees for 40 years and manages more than 500 hives in 70 locations all over the Bay Area. His organic honey operation, Marshall’s Farm Honey in American Canyon near Napa, produces more than 50,000 pounds of honey per year. He has a pretty good idea of what kind of conditions bees need to make copious amount of honey. You wouldn’t think the Fairmont roof would supply those conditions. Marshall himself was skeptical when the hotel’s chef asked him four years ago if he would bring some of his bees to the Nob Hill landmark to exchange for earmarking a modest amount of honey for the kitchen – 10 pounds a year per hive, to be exact. Still, he said OK. And last year, four double-queen hives atop the Fairmont produced more than 1,000 pounds of honey. “In this day and age,” Marshall said, “that’s unheard of.” “We’re right up here where the wind is always blowing … and all you see is concrete, asphalt and big huge high-rise buildings. You don’t see any fields of flowers,” Marshall said. “I really can’t explain it. The only thing I can think that makes sense to me is they have very little competition, and the weather must be just right for them.” Marshall comes from a long line of beekeepers. His great-grandmother raised hives in the Yellowstone area, and Marshall helped his grandmother work a few hives on the family farm in Lodi growing up. But bees and honey weren’t Marshall’s first vocational choice. As a young man he worked on television productions, taught and even did a stint as a carpenter, but nothing felt like the perfect fit. Then his father was paralyzed in a car accident, and Marshall came home to help run the corn and wheat farm. To keep his “sanity,” he said, he took up beekeeping as a hobby. “I kept doing bees, kept doing bees – and one day I asked myself, what’s wrong with bees?” he said. “It’s what I wanted to do. It’s what I read about; it’s what I thought about. It was like, oh yeah, this is it! I don’t have to search anymore.” Four decades and 35,000 stings later, he still loves it. “I’m almost like a doctor, where I’m going into the hive and figuring out what’s going on and what kind of help they need,” Marshall said. “You know, trying to make them stronger, healthier, more productive. “You’re not just punching a clock. You’re involved in something bigger than yourself.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Spencer Marshall is an experienced beekeeper who manages over 500 hives in 70 locations in the Bay Area, with his organic honey operation producing more than 50,000 pounds of honey per year. 2. At the Fairmont Hotel, he maintains rooftop beehives that have produced large quantities of honey, defying expectations given the location's seemingly unfavorable conditions. 3. Marshall believes that minimal competition and suitable weather conditions might be the reasons behind the success of the rooftop beehives. 4. Beekeeping has been a part of Marshall's family history, and he initially took it up as a hobby before realizing that it was his true calling. 5. With over 40 years of experience and a passion for beekeeping, Marshall views his work as more than just a job, as he helps maintain and improve the health and productivity of his bees."},{"instruction":"The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, Momchil, a former brigand whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted with control over the region of Merope in the Rhodope mountains, switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and the bulk of his army, who had sailed home to repel a Latin attack on his main harbour, Smyrna. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked by the Serbs under Gregory Preljub, but prevailed at the Battle of Stephaniana. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring at the head of an army of 20,000 men. Kantakouzenos and Umur raided Bulgaria, and then turned against Momchil. The latter had exploited the power vacuum in the Rhodope, an effective no man's land between the Serbs, Bulgarians and Byzantines, to set himself up as a quasi-independent prince, supported by a substantial force of around 5,000 men. On 7 July 1345, the two armies clashed at Peritheorion. Momchil's army was crushed, and he himself fell in the field. Soon afterwards, Dušan arrived before Serres and laid siege to the city. Rejecting demands by Kantakouzenos to withdraw, a clash appeared inevitable until the murder of Alexios Apokaukos in Constantinople forced Kantakouzenos to direct his attention there.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

She was raised in Brooklyn and later on Long Island. Her parents were Monroe \\"Monty\\" Schlessinger, a civil engineer, and Yolanda (nee Ceccovini) Schlessinger, an Italian Catholic war bride. Schlessinger has said her father was charming and her mother beautiful as a young woman. On August 10, 2010, Nita Hanson, a black woman married to a white man, called Schlessinger's show to ask for advice on how to deal with a husband who did not care when she was the subject of racist comments by acquaintances. Schlessinger first replied that \\"some people are hypersensitive\\" and asked for some examples from the caller. Hanson informed Schlessinger that her acquaintances had stated, \\"How you black people do this? You black people like doing that.\\" Schlessinger responded that her examples were not racist and that \\"a lot of blacks only voted for Obama simply because he was half black. Didn't matter what he was going to do in office; it was a black thing. You gotta' know that. That's not a surprise.\\" Schlessinger continued by telling the caller that she had a \\"chip on [her] shoulder,\\" was \\"sensitive,\\" and also, \\"Don't NAACP me,\\" and, \\"a lot of what I hear from black think... it's really distressing and disturbing.\\" When the caller noted that she was referred to as the \\"n-word\\" by the individuals in question, Schlessinger complained that blacks are fine with cordially using the slur among themselves, but that it was wrong when whites used it to slur them. In doing so, she uttered \\"nigger\\" eleven times, albeit not directed at the caller. She discussed the word and its use by blacks and in black media. Her profuse use of the slur was mimicking the frequency of the word's use among black stand-up comics. When Hanson asked, \\"Is it ever OK to say that word?\\" Schlessinger responded, \\"It depends how it's said. Black guys talking to each other seem to think it's OK.\\" After the call Schlessinger said, \\"If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race.\\" Early that evening she wrote an apology to Los Angeles Radio People online journalist Don Barrett. A day later, as soon as she was back on the air, Schlessinger apologized. Hanson questioned the motivation and sincerity of Schlessinger's apology, believing it to be result of being \\"caught.\\" Hanson also said that Schlessinger did not apologize for her comments on interracial marriage. Schlessinger announced that, while not retiring from radio, she would end her radio show at the end of 2010: I have made the decision not to do radio anymore. I want to regain my First Amendment rights. I want to be able to say what is on my mind. In 2011, she began broadcasting on satellite radio with Sirius XM. Her program is also available as a podcast at iTunes and from her own website.

High school dropout rate decreased from 3.1 to 2.5 percent between 2007 and 2008 with Oklahoma ranked among 18 other states with 3 percent or less dropout rate. In 2004, the state ranked 36th in the nation for the relative number of adults with high school diplomas, though at 85.2 percent, it had the highest rate among southern states.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The state being referred to in the context is Oklahoma. Oklahoma was ranked #36 in the nation for the number of adults with a diploma from high school. Despite this ranking, with an 85.2 percent high school diploma rate, Oklahoma had the highest rate among southern states in 2004. Oklahoma has been recognized for its achievements in pre-kindergarten education. In 2004, the National Institute for Early Education Research rated Oklahoma as the number one state in the United States for standards, quality, and access to pre-kindergarten education. This recognition illustrates the state's commitment to early childhood schooling and serves as a model for other states to follow. The high school dropout rate in Oklahoma has seen a decrease, as it went from a 3.1 percent dropout rate in 2007 to a 2.5 percent dropout rate in 2008. This improvement placed Oklahoma among 18 other states with a dropout rate of 3 percent or less. Although Oklahoma's ranking of 36th in the nation for the relative number of adults with high school diplomas in 2004 might not seem impressive, it is important to consider the progress the state has made in providing quality education to its residents. The high ranking in pre-kindergarten education and the decrease in high school dropout rates suggest a trend of continued improvement in Oklahoma's educational system. Additionally, the fact that Oklahoma's high school diploma rate was the highest among southern states demonstrates the state's determination to enhance public education for its residents. By focusing on early childhood education, setting high standards, and providing access to quality learning opportunities, Oklahoma can continue to work towards increasing the percentage of its population with high school diplomas, thus potentially improving its national ranking in the future."},{"instruction":"Elizabeth, Emma, and Elsa went shopping on Wednesday. In total Emma spent 58 If Elsa spent twice as much as Emma, and Elizabeth spent four times as much as Elsa, how much money did they spend in total? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Determine how much Elsa spent. Elsa spent twice as much as Emma. Since Emma spent 58, we need to multiply that by 2 to find out how much Elsa spent. Elsa's spending = 2 * Emma's spending = 2 * 58 Step 2: Calculate Elsa's spending. Elsa's spending = 2 * 58 = 116 Step 3: Determine how much Elizabeth spent. Elizabeth spent four times as much as Elsa. Since Elsa spent 116, we need to multiply that by 4 to find out how much Elizabeth spent. Elizabeth's spending = 4 * Elsa's spending = 4 * 116 Step 4: Calculate Elizabeth's spending. Elizabeth's spending = 4 * 116 = 464 Step 5: Find the total amount spent by all three of them. Total spent = Emma's spending + Elsa's spending + Elizabeth's spending Total spent = 58 + 116 + 464 Step 6: Calculate the total amount spent by all three.

The task is to check the validity of the answer. Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Q: To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development. The letter is believed to be \\"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \\"race\\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \\"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\\" to initiate the Manhattan Project. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II. For Einstein, \\"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \\"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\\" <sep>Who was asked to send a letter to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research?<sep>Einstein A:","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The Scottish Crime and Justice survey (SCJS) showed that theft or damage to property was the most widely reported crime, making up 71% of the figures. The SCJS also reported the risk of crime in Scotland to be lower than that in England and Wales. The survey showed there was a total of 815,000 recorded incidents of crime over the past year. The new figures showed a 22% drop from the 1,045,000 recorded incidents in 2008-2009. The risk of being a victim of crime also dropped from 20.4% in 2008-2009 to 16.9% in 2012-2013, a drop described as \\"significant\\" by the report. Those living in the most deprived areas were more likely to be a victim of crime. Violent crime continued to fall, with a 25% drop in recorded incidents since 2008-2009. However, the public's fear of being the victim of a violent crime such as mugging has increased, with the perceived risk being almost 20% higher than the actual one. The statistics also showed that public confidence in the police and justice system had increased, with 61% of people saying they believed that their local police were doing a good job. Over three quarters of people surveyed also believed that the level of crime in their areas had stayed the same or reduced. Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said: \\"This survey confirms what we already know. Crime is falling, the risk of being a victim of crime is falling and more people are feeling safer in their communities. \\"The chance of being a victim of crime continues to be in lower in Scotland than in England and Wales and violent crime in Scotland has fallen by a quarter since 2008-2009. It is also reassuring to see that confidence in the police and the criminal justice system continues to improve. He added: \\"These statistical trends are consistent with recorded crime statistics which show crime in Scotland is at its lowest level in almost 40 years with the 1,000 additional police officers that this government has put in communities protecting the public.\\" Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont questioned the effectiveness of the survey by saying that many victims of crime did not report it. He said: \\"There are a number of areas of concern within these findings. It's clear far too many people are victims of crime, and a significant amount don't even bother reporting it because they don't believe it will be solved. \\"There is a big difference in what victims want and what actually happens, and one way the SNP could deal with this is facing up to justice matters and dropping its soft-touch approach.\\" He then added: \\"It is extremely rich of the SNP to be bleating about crime and policing rates when it has closed 60% of Scotland's police stations.\\" Scottish Labour's Community Safety spokeswoman, Elaine Murray said: \\"While any reduction in crime is to be welcomed, the fact that violent crime is up and only a fraction of crime is reported to the police gives cause for concern. \\"The figures also won't reflect the closure of police counters, nor the police officers being taken off our streets to backfill staff roles left empty by SNP cuts. \\"I fear that with the loss of local, accountable policing we will see the potential for the overall figures to begin to move the other way and for confidence in our police to fall back\\", she added.

Read and analyze the premise: \\"Swimmers move through the water.\\" This statement establishes that swimmers, by definition, move in water. However, it does not provide any information about the context of swimming, such as racing, leisure, or any other scenario. 2. Read and analyze the hypothesis: \\"People racing each other swimming in water.\\" This statement suggests a specific context where people are competing with one another while swimming. It implies that there's a competitive aspect to the swimming, which was not addressed in the premise. 3. Compare the premise and the hypothesis to determine if there's enough information to draw a conclusion. The premise only provides a basic understanding of what swimmers do – they move through the water. On the other hand, the hypothesis narrows the focus to a particular situation where people are racing each other while swimming. There is no explicit or implicit indication in the premise that confirms or denies the possibility of a competitive context. 4. Determine the answer. Since the premise does not supply any information about the context of people swimming in a race, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true or false just based on the premise alone.

Grouping together can happen in various contexts, including social gatherings, professional environments, and community organizations. Believing in God, paying bills, enjoying themselves, and facing each other are options that, while potentially related to situations where people might meet, do not inherently involve people coming together in a structured manner. When people \\"group together,\\" they may organize events or meetings with a specific purpose, such as to discuss common interests, collaborate on projects, or build connections. Examples include clubs, support groups, networking events, workshops, or conferences. Grouping together can also be informal, like organizing a sports team, gathering for a barbecue, or attending a party where people can meet and interact with one another. In professional settings, people group together to achieve common goals, exchange ideas, and bring their unique skills and perspectives to the table. For instance, a team of employees working on a project will meet regularly to discuss progress, assign tasks, and brainstorm solutions to issues. Such teamwork contributes to the success of the project while also fostering relationships among the group members. In community contexts, people group together to support shared causes, such as volunteering for local charities, joining a school's parent-teacher association, or participating in neighborhood improvement initiatives. These contexts provide opportunities to engage with others, establish connections, and create a sense of belonging and mutual support that can extend beyond the specific activities of the group. Grouping together strengthens social fabric by creating connections and relationships among individuals. This collaborative approach allows people to share experiences, learn from each other, and work together to achieve common goals, ultimately contributing to a sense of community and personal growth. In conclusion, \\"group together\\" offers the most suitable option for answering the question regarding a way for people to meet with each other. By joining forces, individuals can build connections, exchange ideas, and contribute to mutual goals while both enriching their own lives and fostering social cohesion."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

His first experiences at surveying occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His first opportunity as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional surveying party to lay out large tracts of land along the border of western Virginia, where Washington gained invaluable experience in the field. Washington began his professional career in 1749 at the age of 17, when he was appointed county surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia. He subsequently received a commission and surveyor's license from the College of William & Mary. He completed his first survey in less than two days, plotting a 400-acre parcel of land. He was subsequently able to purchase land in the Shenandoah Valley, the first of his many land acquisitions in western Virginia. For the next four years, Washington worked surveying land in Western Virginia for the Ohio Company, a land investment company funded by Virginia investors. He came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia Robert Dinwiddie, thanks to Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia. In October 1750, Washington resigned his position as an official surveyor, though he continued to survey professionally for two more years before receiving a military appointment as adjutant for southern Virginia. By 1752, Washington completed close to 200 surveys on numerous properties totaling more than 60,000 acres. He continued to survey at different times throughout his life and as late as 1799.

The situation developing in Ukraine and the Middle East may require, once again, everything this country can provide, including both new aircraft carriers. Britain’s “next generation” fighter, the F-35, is not ready, not serviceable, not battle-proven and is so expensive that only small numbers are ordered. Financial prudence was argued in the decision to withdraw the Harrier. However, it is still held in such high regard by other operators – including the USA, who purchased all our Harriers when they were decommissioned – that they will remain in service for many years yet. Britain’s financial circumstances and the world’s security situation have both changed since this decision was made. We need our carriers soon and fully equipped with battle-proven aircraft to give them fighting capability. Harriers of existing specification should be manufactured urgently and in significant numbers. The unit cost would be a fraction of that of the F-35 and they would be in service much earlier. When the F-35 proves itself, it could then be introduced, but aircraft carriers without aircraft are a liability, not an asset. In the hours before battle, Lord Nelson signalled his fleet: “England expects that every man will do his duty.” Part of that duty, surely, is to be ready. We are not.

Answer:","output":"The second bridge to be built over the River Thames in central London was the Blackfriars Bridge, whose construction was officially completed in 1769. However, before diving into its details, it is important to note that the very first bridge, known as the London Bridge, was initially a wooden bridge built by the Romans in the first century AD. Over time, it went through several reconstructions and modifications, eventually becoming a stone bridge that stood as the sole pathway across the river for over a millennium. However, during the 18th century, due to growing population, urbanization and the expansion of businesses, there was a rising need for another bridge as the London Bridge became insufficient to handle the increased flow of people and goods. As a result, discussions and proposals for a new bridge at Blackfriars began. The name \\"Blackfriars\\" stems from the historic presence of the Dominican monastery, also called \\"Blackfriars,\\" which had been a focal point of the area in the medieval period. The attire of the Dominican order and their robes had a black mantle or cloak, hence the name \\"Black Friars.\\" The bridge was to be constructed as an access point between the expanding areas of Blackfriars and the City of London on the north side and the growing borough of Southwark on the south side. The Blackfriars Bridge was designed by architect Robert Mylne, who won a competition held to select the best possible design for the new bridge. Mylne's design was an elegant, somewhat elliptical structure with nine semi-elliptical arches of Portland stone, which was commissioned by the City Corporation. The construction process was relatively smooth, though the engineers faced technical challenges, such as constructing strong foundation bases on the shifting soil and clay around the riverbed. To overcome these challenges, they used innovative engineering techniques of that time, including the use of timber piles that were driven into the riverbed to provide sufficient support. The bridge officially opened to the public in 1769, and its formal name was the William Pitt Bridge, named after Britain's prime minister, though the name \\"Blackfriars Bridge\\" became more widely used and is what it is still known as today. The bridge not only significantly improved the connectivity within London, but it also served as a symbol of technological and engineering advancements of its time. It became an important transportation hub and fostered economic growth, commercial expansion, and increased accessibility for London residents and travelers. However, the original bridge faced issues due to its deteriorating condition and weakening structure as it aged. As a result, in 1860, a new iron bridge designed by engineer Joseph Cubitt was constructed to replace the original stone bridge. The new Blackfriars Bridge, completed in 1869, was sturdier and wider than its predecessor, with five cast-iron arches that spanned a total length of 923 feet. This new bridge is the one that stands today, and it remains a crucial transportation link in central London, with its nearest neighbors being the modern Millennium Bridge and the Southwark Bridge, all spanning across the mighty River Thames."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the name of the stage production that Wim Hogenkamp starred in that started out as a rock musical?

In a sign of how coalition relations will remain fractious until the election in May 2015, the deputy prime minister said the chancellor's plans to target cuts on the working age poor were lopsided and unbalanced. Speaking at his monthly press conference in Whitehall, Clegg said: \\"You've got a Conservative party now who are driven, it seems to me, by two very clear ideological impulses. One is to remorselessly pare back the state – for ideological reasons just cut back the state. \\"Secondly – and I think they are making a monumental mistake in doing so – they say the only people in society, the only section in society, which will bear the burden of further fiscal consolidation are the working-age poor.\\" Signalling how he will waste no time in lambasting Tory plans over the next 16 months, Clegg later added: \\"I literally don't know of a serious economist who believes that you only do it from that lopsided, unbalanced approach. Almost all, serious economists say you have some kind of mix.\\" The deputy prime minister criticised his cabinet colleague after the chancellor warned of a further £25bn of cuts after the next electionthe chancellor warned of a further £25bn of cuts after the next election, targeting council housing for the better-off and housing benefit for under-25s. In a grim message to start the new year, Osborne said Britain was facing a year of hard truths in 2014 as there were more cuts to make and the economy still had big underlying problems. He said he expected the biggest chunk of the savings – around £12bn – to come from welfare in the two years after the election, as it would be an odd choice to leave this \\"enormous budget … untouched\\". Benefits for the young and people of working age would be considered before any cuts to pensioner benefits such as free bus passes and television licences, the chancellor said. The move forms part of Osborne's pledge to run a budget surplus by 2019 if the Conservatives are returned to power at the next election. The Treasury spends £1.9bn on housing benefit for 350,000 people under the age of 25, of whom about half have dependent children. In a speech in the Midlands on Monday morning, Osborne said there was still a long way to go before recovery as he set out a five-point plan to help the economy. \\"We've got to make more cuts – £17bn this coming year, £20bn next year, and over £25bn further across the two years after. That's more than £60bn in total.\\" Osborne built on previous warnings about the need to intensify austerity, on top of billions of pounds of existing cuts, even though the economy appears to be turning a corner. In the speech, he said the job of fixing the economy was \\"not even half done\\". \\"That's why 2014 is the year of hard truths,\\" he said. Clegg has agreed spending plans with Osborne for the first year after the general election and a target to eliminate the budget structural deficit by 2017-18. But in a taste of one of the main election battles – over the means by which the deficit should be cut – Clegg said it was wrong of the chancellor only to highlight the welfare bill for cuts, although Osborne did not say that the proposed £25bn savings would all come from welfare savings. Clegg also said the chancellor was wrong to play down the need for further tax rises. The deputy prime minister said: \\"Where the British people want a future British government to be is in the liberal centre ground where you say, yes of course, you need to finish the job of clearing the decks fiscally, of completing the job of filling the black hole – the so-called structural deficit – by the financial year 2017-18. To that extent the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives are co-authors of fiscal responsibility in setting out that timetable and that plan. \\"But – here is the big difference with the Conservatives – we believe the way in which you finish that job should be done fairly. \\"There are different ways in which you do that. There is Whitehall waste in spending which you continue to bear down on. There is of course further welfare reform, which will always be driven by the need to sharpen the incentives to work. And, yes, there is asking people with the broadest shoulders to make a contribution. That is why I remain perplexed that the Conservatives still refuse to countenance any change in the tax system to ask people occupying very high value properties to make a small, additional contribution to this effort.\\" Clegg's remarks show that the Liberal Democrat manifesto for the next election will include a \\"mansion tax\\" on properties worth more than £2m. But the Lib Dems will also include the \\"triple lock\\" on pensions – increasing them annually in line with inflation, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is highest. David Cameron said on Sunday that the Tories would guarantee the triple lock, one of the main features of the Lib Dem manifesto in 2010, until 2020. The chancellor's negative outlook forms part of his argument that people should vote Conservative to let the party \\"finish the job\\", rather than handing control back to Labour. However, Labour said more cuts were needed after 2015 because Osborne's \\"failure on growth and living standards since 2010 has led to his failure to balance the books\\". Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said the social security bill was rising under Osborne, but the best way to get it down for the long-term is to get people into work and build more homes. \\"The Tories should back our compulsory jobs guarantee for young people and the long-term unemployed. And in tough times it cannot be a priority to continue paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners,\\" he said. \\"What we need is Labour's plan to earn our way to higher living standards for all, tackle the cost-of-living crisis and get the deficit down in a fairer way.\\"","output":"Nick Clegg, a big leader in the UK, said that another big leader, George Osborne, might make a really big mistake. Osborne wants to make more cuts to the country's spending, which means they will spend less money on certain things. Clegg thinks it's not fair because the people who will be affected the most are the working-age poor. Osborne believes the UK still has big problems in its economy, even though things are getting a little better. But Clegg thinks there should be other ways to fix these problems without making things too hard for certain people."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the person who Chafe concluded their party had not reached the island? is inside the article: Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: \\"We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land.\\" The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp.

Of course he helped set the trend, so that got me thinking about the link between films and trends in fashion. Fashion and films have gone hand in hand for long. The Wild One is a good example: it appeared in 1954, starring Brando. Dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket, leather cap and jeans, he created a look which is still considered \\"cool\\" today. Everyone from Madonna to middle-aged men is seen wearing the classic leather motorcycle jacket. Another strong influence on fashion trends was Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn. She made famous the simple black dress that looks perfect at either a cocktail party or just standing around an expensive department store like Tiffany's with a pastry and coffee in your hand, as Audrey Hepburn does in the film. She looks so elegant, wearing simple but beautiful dresses, big dark glasses and a string of pearls around her neck. Audrey Hepburn still influences women's fashion with her \\"Tiffany's look\\". In more modern times, the film star Uma Thurman created a major fashion trend when she appeared in the film Pulp Fiction, made in 1994. Her style was very simple. Her black trousers, crisp white shirt and hair style was copied by women in the world. Influencing fashion trends can often be about timing. The movie Memoirs of a Geisha came just in time to start a trend in Japanese fashion. It started the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who wore beautiful silk kimonos , and it won an Oscar for Costume Design. Many travel companies picked up on the trend and ran \\"geisha trips\\" to Japan.

Local police spokesperson, Officer James Ortega, expressed deep sorrow when speaking about the incident with reporters. He stated that the death of young Billy is currently being treated as 'unexplained,' given the lack of information regarding the circumstances surrounding the fatal rope swing entanglement. Officer Ortega urged the community to come forward with any relevant information or eyewitness accounts that may help establish what happened that fateful afternoon. While law enforcement conducts an investigation to determine the exact cause of the accident, a post-mortem examination will also be performed to provide further insight into the tragic death of Billy Hughes. As the heartbreaking news spread, an outpouring of support and condolences has been directed towards Billy's family by friends, neighbors, teachers, and even strangers who are touched by the story. Members of the local community have organized several community events, including a candlelight vigil and fundraiser, to not only remember Billy but also to support his grieving family during this incredibly difficult time. This tragic incident has also sparked conversations about the safety of popular childhood objects, such as rope swings, and how such toys and equipment should be set up and maintained. It is a tragic reminder to parents and caretakers to always be vigilant and cautious when it comes to their children's safety. While the investigation continues, the community remains stunned by the sudden loss of Billy Hughes. The vibrant, wide-eyed, and ever-curious child was known to bring joy and smiles to everyone he encountered. This tragedy is a stark reminder of just how precious and fragile life can be. Above all, the community hopes to find answers that will eventually provide Billy's family and loved ones with some semblance of understanding and closure. In the wake of this heartbreaking loss, Billy's family is asking for privacy and respect during this sensitive time. Those wishing to help support the grieving family can attend the upcoming community events and contribute to the fundraiser."},{"instruction":"Delicious!

She received praise throughout the competition, and although the favourite to win after the second round, she finished outside the top three in the live final on 31 May. During the competition, she was tutored by singing coach Yvie Burnett and received offers from various record labels. After the show, she, unlike other finalists, did not sign with Simon Cowell's Syco, although she did appear on fellow finalist Andrew Johnston's debut album, One Voice. In July 2009 it was announced that Smith was hoping to release her second album later in the year. In an interview, she expressed surprise and pleasure that the label wanted her to do another album so soon after the first. In September, further details about the album were released, including its name, Wonderland, and planned release date, 30 November. Smith claimed that Faryl \\"was an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording\\", while Cohen, producer of both Faryl and Wonderland, said Smith had \\"matured as an artist since the first album and I have no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances\\". The album, which was recorded at Sarm Studios in Notting Hill, London, was completed in early October, and is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Wonderland was released on 30 November. To publicise the album, Smith appeared on numerous radio shows, as well as television appearances including Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and Sky News Sunrise. Wonderland was well received by critics; Paul Callan, reviewing the album for the Daily Express, described it as \\"a joy\\". He compared it to other Christmas albums, saying that \\"[t]oo many are tired, much-repeated carol selections.\\" He described Smith's \\"control, tone and warmth\\" as \\"very moving\\". Andy Gill, reviewing Wonderland for The Independent, gave a less positive review. He said that the influence of Alice in Wonderland was often hard to perceive and that Cohen and Smith had \\"sweetened the classical elements\\". However, he praised the arrangements of \\"Adiemus\\", \\"Barcarolle\\", \\"Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence\\" and \\"Blow The Wind Southerly\\", but noted that on tracks including \\"Close To You\\", \\"the lack of emotional weight is telling.\\" Overall, Gill gave Wonderland 3 out of 5. However, the album failed to perform as well as Faryl; it entered the British album charts at number 56 for the week ending 12 December before dropping to number 92 the following week and then out of the top 100. After Wonderland, Smith's contract with Universal ended, and she subsequently received less attention from the press. Smith described the break with the label as mainly her decision, as she needed to focus on her A levels, which would allow her to get to university, explaining in an interview that \\"It wasn't like it ended horribly.\\" Smith performed at the 2009 Royal Variety Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth II, where she sang \\"God Save the Queen\\" with The Soldiers. She later said that the experience, including subsequently meeting the Queen, as the highlight of her year. Smith also performed elsewhere with The Soldiers, including at St Paul's Cathedral and Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. What is the purpose of Wonderland?","output":"Wonderland is an album created by Faryl Smith, a British singer who became famous after participating in a TV show called Britain's Got Talent. The purpose of this album is to share her beautiful singing voice and her musical talents with people who enjoy listening to it. The album is inspired by a story called Alice in Wonderland and has songs that people can enjoy during the Christmas time. It's a way for Faryl to grow as an artist and a performer and for people to enjoy her music."},{"instruction":"Le Conseil de sécurité est invité à soumettre périodiquement pour examen, conformément à l'Article 24 de la Charte, des rapports spéciaux thématiques à l'Assemblée générale au sujet de questions d'intérêt international.

Researchers think it is a relative of the endangered South Asian river dolphin, offering clues to the evolutionary history of modern species. The findings have been published in the journal open access PeerJ. The fossil, a partial skull about 22cm (9ins) long, was discovered in southeastern Alaska by geologist Donald J Miller. It then spent decades in the collection of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington DC. The dolphin swam in sub-arctic marine waters about 25 million years ago, according to the new study's authors Alexandra Boersma and Nicholas Pyenson, who are based at the Smithsonian. The specimen represents a new genus and species, they say, which has been named Arktocara yakataga. Based on the age of nearby rocks, the scientists estimated that Arktocara came from the late Oligocene epoch, around the time that ancient whales diversified into two groups - the baleen whales, which include blue whales and humpbacks, and the toothed whales, which include sperm whales, porpoises and dolphins. By studying the skull and comparing it to those of other dolphins, both living and extinct, the team determined that A. yakataga is a relative of the South Asian river dolphin Platanista. This living dolphin is the last survivor of a once-widespread group. The skull confirms that Platanista belongs to one of the oldest lineages of toothed whales still alive today. \\"One of the most useful ways we can study Platanista is... by looking at fossils that are related to it to try to get a better sense of where it's coming from,\\" said Ms Boersma. \\"Exactly how that once diverse and globally widespread group dwindled down to a single species in Southeast Asia is still somewhat a mystery, but every little piece that we can slot into the story helps.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"A very old extinct animal, which is like a special kind of dolphin, was discovered by looking at a skull that had been in a museum since 1951.

The Department of Energy grabs 21 million from Fisker Automotive The Fisker Karma has the looks of a Ferrari or Lamborghini, a celebrity clientele that includes Leonardo DiCaprio and teen heart-throb Justin Bieber, and much of the green-minded eco credential of a Toyota Prius. Yet the fate of this seductive plug-in hybrid sedan could soon have more in common with the departed DeLorean Motor Company, considering the automaker’s mounting financial problems. Justin Bieber had his Fisker Karma chromed, and then pulled over by the Los Angeles police on at least two occasions. Yet financially troubled Silicon Valley-based Fisker Automotive needs much more than a celebrity-fueled jolt of publicity to get it out of its current predicament. Burning cash and in desperate search for some form of automotive alliance – or someone to simply buy the company outright – Fisker finds itself in the crosshairs of the U.S. Department of Energy, which forcibly recovered 21 million as partial repayment of roughly 200 million worth of outstanding U.S. government loans. PHOTOS: AMERICA'S GAS-FREE FUTURE Those loans were part of an eco-themed initiative intended to boost fledgling companies with a dedicated green initiative. As reported by Reuters, Fisker presently owes the U.S. government about 192 million of the 529 million loan it received from the DOE in 2009. That’s a big check to pay for any auto company, much less a boutique brand with one luxury-based model in its lineup. Granted, the high price of the Karma sedan narrows its overall sales pool but, much like the majority of A-list celebs, this plug-in hybrid doesn’t lack anything in the looks department. RELATED: STEVEN TYLER SHOWS OFF HIS 1.1 MILLION HENNESSEY VENOM GT SPYDER The Karma has the lines of a dedicated supercar, thanks to its wildly curvaceous fenders and ground-hugging stance – though some have suggested the front grille bears a striking resemblance to a waxed moustache. Under the curvaceous hood is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, coupled to a pair of electric motors which are powered by a lithium-ion battery pack. The Karma is capable of running solely on electric power for approximately 30 miles and, once that point is reached, the gasoline-fed engine functions as an onboard generator for a total driving range of 230 miles. RELATED: SOCCER STAR CRISTIANO RONALDO'S DAMAGED FERRARI SET TO SELL ON EBAY Fisker prefers to quote the EPA’s combined gasoline and electric-only driving formula of 52 MPGe. Yet when functioning purely in gas-powered format, the Karma’s 20-mpg average is not even half of that impressive sounding figure. The company had hoped to introduce a smaller, cheaper model called the Atlantic, along with variations of the Karma that included a gorgeous convertible and sleek station-wagon. These plans, along with the fate of the entire company, are now on exceedingly shaky ground. ||||| Article Excerpt For a few months in 2012, Bruce Simon, the chief executive of gourmet food retailer Omaha Steaks International Inc., drove a 100,000 plug-in hybrid electric car known as the Fisker Karma. No longer. Mr. Simon says his car broke down four times over the span of a few months. Each time, Fisker Automotive Inc. picked it up and sent it by trailer from his home in Omaha, Neb., to a dealer in Minneapolis. The Karma was \\"so vulnerable to software errors, and the parts used were of such poor quality that eventually I insisted they take the car back and ... ||||| Newly released documents show that the Obama administration was warned as early as 2010 that electric car maker Fisker Automotive Inc. was not meeting milestones set up for a half-billion-dollar government loan, nearly a year before U.S. officials froze the loan after questions were raised about the company's statements. An Energy Department official said in a June 2010 email that Fisker's bid to draw on the federal loan might be jeopardized for failure to meet goals established by the Energy Department. Despite that warning, Fisker continued to receive money until June 2011, when the DOE halted further funding. The agency did so after Fisker presented new information that called into question whether key milestones _ including launch of the company's signature, 100,000 Karma hybrid _ had been achieved, according to a credit report prepared by the Energy Department. The December 2011 credit report said \\"DOE staff asked questions about the delays\\" in the launch of the Karma \\"and received varied and incomplete explanations,\\" leading to the suspension of the loan. Fisker had received a total of 192 million of the 529 million loan before it was suspended. In the June 2010 email, Sandra Claghorn, an official in DOE's loan program office, had written that Fisker \\"may be in limbo due to a lack of compliance with financial covenants\\" set up by the Energy Department to protect taxpayers in the event of default. Another document, from April 2010, listed milestones that Fisker had not yet met. Aoife McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said the June 2010 email was taken out of context. \\"The document shows that one person at a meeting discussed the possibility that Fisker might not meet a financial commitment\\" required by the Energy Department, McCarthy said in an email late Tuesday. DOE received the needed certification five days later and subsequently made the loan payment, she said. The Associated Press obtained the Fisker documents ahead of a House hearing scheduled for Wednesday on the federal loan to the troubled car maker, which has laid off three-fourths of its workers amid continuing financial and production problems. The potential loss of 171 million would be largest loss of federal loan money since the 2011 failure of solar panel maker Solyndra, which declared bankruptcy and laid off all its workers after receiving a 528 million loan from the Energy Department. The Energy Department seized 21 million from Fisker this month as it continued to seek repayment from the car maker for the 2009 loan. A payment from Fisker was due Monday, but was not made, a DOE official said. Henrik Fisker, the company's namesake and founder, was scheduled to testify at Wednesday's hearing. Fisker, who was forced out as CEO as the company's troubles mounted, said in prepared testimony that he remained proud of the company's \\"cutting edge technology,\\" which he said could \\"pave the way for a new generation of American car manufacturing.\\" Fisker has not built a vehicle since last summer and has failed to secure a buyer as its cash reserves have dwindled. ___ Follow Matthew Daly on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The Fisker Karma, a plug-in hybrid sedan with a celebrity clientele that includes Leonardo DiCaprio and Justin Bieber, has found itself in financial turmoil.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who was released before a second search Movie plot title: The Lives of Others Movie plot: The Lives of Others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. The film opens in East Berlin in 1984 with a sequence that alternates scenes from an interrogation with scenes from a training class for aspiring officers of the Stasi, or secret police. Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), code name HGW XX/7, is demonstrating his interrogation technique using audio of his own interrogation of a suspect. Wiesler instructs the students on how to tell whether a subject is lying. A student asks a question that Wiesler judges to be a bit too compassionate (read \\"bourgeois\\"), and the professor marks the student's name on the attendance record: surely this student has just flunked the course, or worse. During the feature's first thirty minutes, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck draws a portrait of Wiesler that borders on caricature: Wiesler is a highly skilled officer of the Stasi, a proud, zealous, disciplined and entirely cold-blooded professional. He is one of the many cogs in the wheel of \\"the System,\\" working anonymously and tirelessly, convinced that his efforts are building a better Socialist society.At the end of the class, Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), Wiesler's old school friend (and probably his only friend), who has risen to the position of head of the Culture Department at Stasi, comes to invite Wiesler to a theatrical premiere. The play is by the celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and its leading character is played by Dreyman's lover, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), an actress of great reputation. Dreyman, who writes plays about the heroic proletariat, lives a rather comfortable life in a plush East Berlin apartment, enjoying a certain notoriety among DDR officials who value him because he's one of the few East German writers whose work is read in the west.

Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water.The capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025,says a report by the World Bank. Hannan, an 18yearold from Lahej, said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply.\\"In a good week we'll have a water supply all week but then the following week there will be water only for a day or two, \\" she said. She and her husband, a factory worker, pay 3,000 riyals (99yuan) for a week's supply of water from a touring water truck when the taps run dry.With an income of only 20,000 riyals (660yuan) a month,this means the family often spend half their money on water. \\"There are a lot of people who can't afford it and they have to rely on their neighbors to help,\\" she said. The average person in Yemen survives on onefifth of what the World Health Organization considers to be enough water. In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country. The government is considering desalinating seawater,but this would be expensive and it may now be too late.The only other solution is to cut down on farming, but that means importing even more food.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes. Story: Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds. Solution:","output":"Question: Comparing the crop production and nutritional quality of Hill farm's GMO crops and Valley farm's non-GMO crops, what potential economic and health implications could arise due to the use of herbicides and pesticides on Hill farm, and how might this affect the demand for their products in countries with strict GMO regulations?"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose presence is barely tolerated?

Given these facts, what property do germs have that can make people sick among the following options: - coded genes - hyperthyroidism - hypothyroidism - chickenpox - smallpox - viruses - Echinoids - resistance Answer:","output":"Among the given options, the properties that germs possess that can make people sick are coded genes and resistance. It is essential to recognize that germs, including bacteria and viruses, have unique characteristics that enable them to cause illness in susceptible hosts. 1. Coded genes: Germs contain genetic information in the form of DNA or RNA, which influences their pathogenic properties. These coded genes contain instructions to produce specific proteins, enzymes, and other molecules that enable the germ to infect host cells, multiply, and spread within the host body. Some of these proteins can be used as virulence factors, which allow the pathogens to invade host tissues or suppress the host's immune system. For example, some bacteria produce pore-forming toxins that can damage the cell membranes of host cells, causing cell death and tissue destruction. Some viruses, on the other hand, can produce proteins that interfere with the host's immune response, enabling the virus to propagate more efficiently within the host's body. 2. Resistance: Resistance is the ability of a germ to survive and multiply despite the presence of substances meant to inhibit or kill it, such as antibiotics or antiviral drugs. Resistance can occur in both bacteria and viruses and has become a significant public health concern worldwide. Bacteria can develop resistance through several mechanisms. One common way is through the acquisition of genes that provide resistance to specific antibiotics. These genes can be transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms such as conjugation, transformation, or transduction. Some bacteria can also develop resistance by mutating existing genes to alter the target of the antibiotic, reduce the uptake or increase the efflux of antibiotics, or produce enzymes that inactivate or degrade the antibiotic. Similar to bacteria, viruses can also develop resistance to antiviral drugs. Resistance in viruses can occur through spontaneous mutations in the viral genome or genetic reassortment that results in a virus acquiring new genes or gene segments that encode resistance to the drug. This resistance may involve changes to the viral enzymes targeted by the drug, alterations in viral replication or assembly processes, or modifications of the viral surface proteins that prevent the drug from binding to the virus. In summary, germs possess properties such as coded genes and resistance that enable them to cause illness in humans. Coded genes provide the necessary instructions for the germs to infect host cells and express pathogenic proteins or virulence factors, while resistance allows the germs to evade the host's immune system or survive in the presence of treatment efforts. Understanding these properties is critical to developing effective prevention and treatment strategies to reduce the impact of these pathogens on human health."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Chicago for the following movie plot: From a tape made by reporter Carl Kolchak Darren McGavin]. \\"This is the story behind one of the greatest manhunts in history.

How do I control my emotion and feeling? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions you've asked are similar but not exactly the same. The first question specifically asks about controlling emotions and fears, while the second question focuses on controlling emotions and feelings in general. Although fear is an emotion, the second question has a broader scope, encompassing any emotion or feeling. Now, I will provide you with a step-by-step approach to address the first question: How can I control my emotion and fears? Step 1: Self-awareness Identify the emotions and fears that you are experiencing. Recognizing them is crucial for controlling and navigating through them. Step 2: Acceptance Accept that it's normal to feel emotions and fears. Embrace these feelings rather than trying to suppress them, which could lead to more stress or anxiety. Step 3: Self-reflection Examine the root causes of your emotions and fears. What specific situations or external factors trigger them? Reflect on your past experiences and how you've responded to similar situations. Step 4: Develop coping strategies Once you understand the origins and triggers, create coping strategies such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, positive visualization, or journaling. Step 5: Seek support Reach out to friends, family, or a mental health professional for support and guidance. They can provide new perspectives and coping mechanisms for dealing with your emotions and fears. Step 6: Gradual exposure When applicable, expose yourself to the situation or object that arouses fear in a controlled and gradual manner. This can help to rebuild confidence and diminish the intensity of the emotion over time. Step 7: Practice self-compassion Acknowledge that fear is a natural and universal emotion. Be kind to yourself and remember that it takes time and practice to control emotions and fears effectively. By following these steps, you can develop the techniques needed to control your emotions and fears, as well as cultivate emotional resilience."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a movie review?","output":"Alright, imagine we're talking about the movie \\"The Lion King\\".

General Motors (GM), one of the largest automakers in the world, announced its plan to transition to an all-electric future. In January 2021, the company revealed its ambitious goal to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. This means that by 2035, GM aims to only sell electric vehicles, phasing out gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles from their lineup. Furthermore, the automaker is aiming to become carbon neutral across its global operations by 2040.

A tribunal has heard they allegedly continued to bring claims despite having evidence their Iraqi clients were not innocent civilians. Mr Day said the solicitors' code of conduct was \\"ingrained\\" in him. As well as the misconduct charges against him, his firm and Ms Malik being heard at the tribunal, another solicitor - Anna Crowther - denies an allegation of destroying a key document. Leigh Day pursued damages claims against the Ministry of Defence over the alleged mistreatment and unlawful killing of captives following the Battle of Danny Boy in May 2004. During a press conference in February 2008, Mr Day and now-disgraced lawyer Phil Shiner outlined accusations of the torture and execution of up to 20 Iraqi civilians, and the torture of a further nine at nearby Camp Abu Naji.. Among them was a claim by Khuder Al-Sweady that his nephew, Hamid Al-Sweady had been murdered and tortured by the British Army. The resultant Â£31m Al-Sweady inquiry later dismissed the claims as \\"entirely false\\", and found Hamid had been an armed insurgent who died in battle. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), which has brought the case, has accused Leigh Day of pursuing the claims despite holding key evidence that \\"undermined\\" their authenticity. Leigh Day had a document showing the claimants were not civilians but linked to the radical Shia group Office of the Martyr Al Sadr (OMS), the tribunal has heard. Timothy Dutton QC, for the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) suggested to Mr Day, who has been a practising solicitor for nearly 40 years, that he had \\"lost sight\\" of his professional responsibilities.

Records. Largely recorded in California in 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. The band wanted to expand on the commercial success of their eponymous 1975 album, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife among band members, which shaped the album's lyrics. Recorded with the intention of making \\"a pop album\\", the album's music featured a pop rock and soft rock sound characterized by accented rhythms and electric keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes or Hammond B3 organ. The members partied and used cocaine for much of the recording sessions, and its completion was delayed by its mixing process, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours. Rumours reached the top of both the US Billboard 200 and the United Kingdom Albums Chart, and became the band's most successful release. The songs \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Don't Stop\\", and \\"You Make Loving Fun\\" were released as singles, all of which reached the US top 10. Having won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978, Rumours has since sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time, and has received diamond certifications in several countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. The album garnered widespread acclaim from critics, with praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists and has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of \\"Silver Springs\\", which had been excluded..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The members of Fleetwood Mac partied and used cocaine for much of the recording sessions during the making of the Rumours album."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

They are managed by the multimedia talent agency, Johnny & Associates, and signed to Imperial Records. The group was formed in 2002 and made their CD debut in 2004 as \\"Johnny's modern enka group\\", though after the year 2006, their sound and style has become a mix of pop and rock. Like the rest of the acts managed under Johnny & Associates, Kanjani Eight also perform in various other areas of the Japanese entertainment industry such as variety show hosting, television, movie, and stage acting, and radio talk show hosting. Kanjani Eight was the combination of the four top leading Kansai Juniors of the \\"Junior golden age\\" and the newly popular V. West (Five West), a rock band Kansai Junior unit. Prior to the creation of the group, Subaru Shibutani, Yuu Yokoyama, Shingo Murakami, and Ryo Nishikido were one of the top leading juniors of the time, headlining many Junior hosted programs and acting in dramas. After the debuts of Arashi and Tackey & Tsubasa, the golden era was suddenly coming to an end and so was their popularity. By the year 2001 all their activity had slowed down to magazine photoshoots. On the contrary, a new Kansai Junior unit named V. West was taking off in popularity, more so than their eastern counterpart FiVe. The group consisted of Ryuhei Maruyama, Shota Yasuda, Hiroki Uchi, Kiyohito Mizuno, and Tooru Imayama. The group became so popular that by 2001 they had their own television show, Weekly V. West. But, when Mizuno and Imayama left Johnny's & Associates, worry had begun to creep within unit as to their fate within the talent agency. In 2002, after the end of Weekly V. West, a new program was created to replace it on Kansai TV Channel 8 entitled J3Kansai (pronounced as J Cube Kansai). This show brought together the top leading Kansai Juniors of the golden age and V. West creating the new Junior group, Kanjani, a portmanteau of the words Kansai Johnny's. With the success of the stage play, Another, the group became official garnering the name Kanjani Eight. The \\"8\\" stood for the channel that the show J3Kansai aired on. Tadayoshi Ohkura had been added to the group as a drummer and then as an official member in the 12 episode finalizing the group as an eight-member group. Kanjani Eight, as a newly formed group, held their first concert in December 2002, titled \\" Kanjani Eight Xmas Party 2002 \\". This concert ended up becoming a yearly tradition before ending in 2005. It was also the birthplace of the group's signature act, Kanjani Sentai Eight Ranger. In 2003, Kanjani Eight members Nishikido and Uchi were called to go to Tokyo to become a part of NEWS, another Johnny & Associates group.

Options are: i. no. ii. yes.","output":"To answer the question \\"Why is yawning considered to be contagious?\\" and \\"Why is yawning so infectious?\\", I will follow several steps: Step 1: Understand the questions The questions aim to understand the reasons behind the contagious nature of yawning. Step 2: Explanation Yawning is considered contagious because it often triggers a similar response in people who observe someone yawning. It is believed to be a form of social bonding, mimicry, and communication. The contagiousness of yawning has been observed not just in humans but also in animals like chimpanzees and dogs. There are several theories as to why yawning is infectious: 1. Mirror neurons: These are specialized neurons that fire both when we perform an action and when we see someone else perform the same action. These neurons are thought to be responsible for the contagious nature of yawning as they send signals to our brains that make us imitate the yawner. 2. Empathy and social bonding: Yawning contagiously strengthens social bonds and promotes empathy among individuals. This theory suggests that by yawning together, people demonstrate that they are connected and empathize with each other. 3. Tiredness and relaxation: Contagious yawning can serve as a signal that it is time to rest or that the environment is relaxed and safe. Observing someone else yawn can trigger our awareness of our own need for rest and relaxation. Answering the multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Options are: i. no. ii. yes. The answer is ii. yes.

Intimidated by the calling's demands and ignoring his father's orders, E.B. runs away to Hollywood to pursue his dream of becoming a drummer. E.B.'s father sends his three ninja royal guards, the Pink Berets, to find his son. Meanwhile, Easter Chick Carlos plots a coup d'Ã©tat against him to take over the Easter organization. At Van Nuys, E.B. is hit by Fred O'Hare, an out-of-work, job-hopping slacker (who is being pressured by his family to \\"get a job\\") who was driving to his sister Sam's boss's house he is house-sitting, while his parents forced him to move out. Feigning injury, E.B. persuades Fred to take him in as he recovers, but when E.B. causes trouble, Fred attempts to abandon him in the wilderness. E.B. persuades the human to help him by claiming to be the Easter Bunny, whom Fred saw in operation in his youth. The rabbit sees the Berets closing in on him and hides inside a business where Fred is having a job interview. E.B. enjoys a successful recording session with the Blind Boys of Alabama as their substitute drummer, but ruins Fred's job interview. In the process, E.B. gets a tip about a possible audition for David Hasselhoff, who invites him to perform on his show. Afterward, Fred attends his adopted younger sister Alex's school Easter pageant with E.B. hiding in a satchel. E.B., alarmed that the Pink Berets have apparently found him due to the three bunny suit shadows on a wall and disgusted by Alex's awful rendition of \\"Peter Cottontail\\", dashes out and disrupts the show.

Hypothesis: The fact that Americans underestimate is certailny not one of the reasons for that. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise and hypothesis appear to be contradictory statements. To clarify the relationship between these two statements, let's dive deeper into their meanings. Premise: One reason for this mistaken notion is that most Americans dramatically underestimate. In this statement, the premise suggests that a significant factor contributing to a misunderstanding or misperception is the tendency for Americans to underestimate something. Whatever the subject matter is, the focus here is on the behavior of underestimation as a driving force behind a particular mistaken notion. Hypothesis: The fact that Americans underestimate is certainly not one of the reasons for that. On the other hand, the hypothesis presented contradicts the premise by stating that the behavior of Americans underestimating is not a reason for the aforementioned mistaken notion. Essentially, the hypothesis negates the claim made in the premise. In summary, the premise entails that American underestimation is a reason for a particular mistaken notion, while the hypothesis asserts that the same underestimation is not a contributing factor. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as they convey opposing views on the subject matter."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991. - Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel or Vrangel (\\"Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Vrangel\\" April 25, 1928) was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army and later commanding general of the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Southern Russia in the later stages of the Russian Civil War. After his side lost the civil war in 1920, he left Russia and became one of the most prominent exiled White émigrés. - Alexander Pavlovich Rodzyanko ( Russian : ; 18 August 1879 -- 6 May 1970 ) was a lieutenant - general and a corps commander of the White Army during the Russian Civil War . - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen. - The Crimean Peninsula (\\"Krymskiy poluostrov;\\" , \\"Kryms'ky pivostriv\\"), also known simply as Crimea ( \\"Krym\\" \\"Krym\\"), is a major land mass on the northern coast of the Black Sea that is almost completely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast. The peninsula is located south of the Ukrainian region of Kherson and west of the Russian region of Kuban. It is connected to Kherson Oblast by the Isthmus of Perekop and is separated from Kuban by the Strait of Kerch. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov. - The Green armies, Green Army (Russian: \\" \\"), or Greens (Russian: \\"\\") were armed peasant groups which fought against all governments in the Russian Civil War of 191722. They fought to protect their communities from requisitions or reprisals carried out by third parties. At times associated with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (by far the largest grouping of the Russian Constituent Assembly elected in 1917), the Green Armies had at least tacit support throughout much of Russia. However, the Green Armies' primary base, the peasantry, were largely reluctant to wage an active campaign during the Russian Civil War. Its strength during the civil war has been measured at 40,000 men. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'occupation'.

By serving as an excellent focal point, visitors can use the landmark as a reference point to navigate and identify their positions within the city. This component of the premise strongly supports the hypothesis. 2. \\"It's a spectacular vantage point for many of the city's great landmarks.\\" A vantage point is a location that offers a wide, panoramic view of the surrounding area. If the landmark in question provides an exceptional viewpoint for other significant sites in the city, it serves as a valuable resource for visitors looking to appreciate and explore the city's notable attractions. While this statement does not directly mention location determination, the fact that it provides a view of other city landmarks indirectly supports the hypothesis of being helpful for visitors to orient themselves in the city. 3. \\"Its bridges and quays offer history, entertainment, shopping, and exercise.\\" This part of the premise illustrates that the landmark, along with its bridges and quays, holds historical and cultural significance, and provides various activities and experiences for both tourists and locals alike. This statement does not directly address location determination for visitors. However, it highlights the landmark's prominence in the city, which may contribute to its visibility and ease of recognition, thus further supporting its role as a helpful point of reference for determining visitor's locations. In conclusion, the positive aspects of the premise detailed above, such as being an excellent focal point and vantage point for important landmarks, have a strong connection to the hypothesis \\"It provides a perfect landmark suited to helping visitors determine their location in the city.\\" While not all components of the premise specifically relate to location determination, the overall analysis of the premise supports the hypothesis and suggests that this landmark is indeed well-suited to aiding visitors in navigating and orienting themselves within the city."},{"instruction":"W: It still works.

I'm wondering if I should replace it. Person B: Have you tried fixing it or adjusting the settings to see if it improves the performance? Person A: Yeah, I've tried, but it hasn't made much of a difference. Person B: Well, if you can't find a way to improve its efficiency, maybe you should consider getting a new one. Modern coffee machines are designed to be more energy-efficient and easy to use. Person A: I guess that's true, but the old one still works, and I don't want to spend money on a new machine. Person W: It still works. You'd better get rid of these wasteful habits. In this scenario, Person W is advising Person A to acknowledge the importance of addressing their wasteful habits, despite their reluctance to part with an old, less efficient appliance. Person W may be highlighting the fact that, although the old coffee machine still works, it may be contributing to unnecessary energy consumption or wasting resources that could be used more efficiently with a newer model. According to Person W, it would be beneficial for Person A to recognize the long-term implications of their choices and consider adopting more sustainable practices."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following passage \\"Meanwhile, on 10 October 1950, the 89th Tank Battalion was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division, increasing the armor available for the Northern Offensive.

On the game's opening drive, the Patriots drove 66&#160;yards on 11 plays, stalling at the Bengals' 13-yard line before Gostkowski hit a 31-yard field goal. The Bengals' next drive would span five plays but only one yard, ending in a punt. After an exchange of punts, the Patriots began a drive from their own 35-yard line, but quickly advanced into Bengals territory on a 49-yard Morris run. Three plays later, Brady hit Vrabel on a 1-yard touchdown pass to extend the Patriots lead to 10-0. After a Bengals punt on the first play of the second quarter, the Patriots had the ball but found themselves in a 3rd-and-23 situation, when Brady was intercepted by Leon Hall at the Bengals' 35-yard line. The Bengals capitalized on the turnover, with Carson Palmer ending a five-play drive on a 1-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh. The Patriots responded by going on a 12-yard, 62-yard drive, finishing it with a 7-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 17-7. The Bengals managed to reach the Patriots' 20-yard line on their next possession, but a Samuel interception at the 2-yard line kept the Bengals from scoring at the end of the first half. The Bengals reached midfield on the opening drive of the third quarter before punting. From their own 19-yard line, the Patriots moved deep in Bengals territory after a 15-yard penalty was tacked onto a 16-yard Moss catch. A few plays later, Morris ran for his second touchdown of the night; the 7-yard run opened the Patriots lead to 24-7. The Bengals, though, continued to threaten the Patriots offensively, moving to the Patriots' 22-yard line before linebacker Tedy Bruschi tipped a third-down pass to force a 40-yard Shayne Graham field goal. The Patriots next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but a Morris run on third down from the Bengals' 13-yard line was stopped for a loss, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. Yet again, the Bengals moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing drive, but the Patriots defense prevented another touchdown and forced a 48-yard field goal, making the score 27-13. On the Patriots' next drive, a 23-yard Stallworth catch put the Patriots in Bengals territory, setting up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss. Down 34-13, the Bengals continued to move the ball with a 17-yard Houshmandzadeh catch on the next play, but Palmer's next pass attempt was intercepted by Randall Gay at the Patriots' 47-yard line. The Patriots then ran out the clock to end the game and bring their record to 4-0.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. I am facing a new situation today: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","output":"Sample A would produce ATP molecules because it has a higher respiration rate, which means that cellular respiration is taking place. During cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen are used to create ATP molecules for energy. In contrast, sample B has no respiration rate, so ATP molecules would not be produced in that organism."},{"instruction":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The public services watchdog has issued a critical report regarding the incident, raising concerns about the importance of properly addressing mental health concerns through emergency helplines and support systems. Step 1: Background information on NHS 24 - Briefly explain what NHS 24 is and its objectives (to provide round-the-clock health and medical advice to the public in the United Kingdom) - Highlight the critical role it plays in supporting people during emergencies and the responsibility it holds to provide accurate, effective guidance and support Step 2: Overview of the incident - Present a brief summary of the tragic incident in question (a distressed woman contacted NHS 24 for assistance, but after the call, she took her own life) Step 3: Watchdog's criticism on NHS 24's handling of the call - Discuss the public services watchdog's findings, which condemn the actions taken by NHS 24 during the phone call - Detail the ways in which NHS 24's response was deemed inappropriate or inadequate in this situation (e.g., insufficient support or guidance provided to the distressed woman) Step 4: Impact of the criticism and incident on public trust - Examine the potential consequences of this incident (e.g., if it erodes public trust in NHS 24 and its ability to effectively address mental health issues) - Emphasize the importance of maintaining the public's faith in national healthcare services, especially during times of mental health crisis Step 5: Importance of addressing mental health concerns - Discuss the rising prevalence of mental health issues and their impact on society - Emphasize the need for effective mental health support systems and swift access to appropriate care Step 6: Recommendations for improvement - Offer recommendations on how NHS 24 and similar helpline services can better address mental health concerns (e.g., implementing more rigorous training for call handlers, streamlining protocols) - Encourage public health officials to continually review and update mental health care practices and policies Conclusion: The public services watchdog's criticism of NHS 24's handling of a distressed woman's call serves as a stark reminder of the crucial role emergency helplines play in our society. As mental health concerns continue to impact countless lives, it is essential that public health services are held accountable for their actions and strive to improve their support systems to ensure that those in need are effectively guided and assisted.

As the muggers check their seemingly unconscious victim for cash, The Man regains consciousness and brutally kills them. Around that time, Inspector Peter Neilson is investigating the apparent murder scene of the young Melissa and Nikki. In a flashback, the two girls are shown in a goth club looking to pick up men. Melissa spotted The Man and took him home. After spending the night with him, she began hallucinating about the people around turning to her with monstrous faces and voices. Melissa went to Nikki's house to seek help, then a creature burst out of Melissa's womb and attacked Nikki, killing both. Sophie and Emma break into a house in a burglary attempt. When Emma finds a box of money under a bed, a bony old man pops up from the bedcovers and attacks her. The girls stab and bludgeon the old man multiple times before he finally dies. Intending to keep the loot to herself and seeing Emma as a liability for revealing their plan to her sister, Sophie kills Emma and runs home. There, the re-animated bodies of Emma and the old man appear and stab Sophie to death. As the dead bodies are identified, Inspector Neilson links them to an earlier case he had solved in the past. The case involved a man named Kemper, former hypnotist and son of an infamous Satanist. Kemper had been using his skills to manipulate, abduct and kill children for over 25 years until he was apprehended by Neilson, tried and committed to a lunatic asylum.

The Pennsylvania State Capitol houses the chambers for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The Capitol contains 475 rooms and has four floors, not including a mezzanine between the first and second floors, and a basement. The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center. The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France. The staircase leads to the mezzanine between the first and second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the \\"four forces of civilization\\": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and \\"symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization\\". The lunettes are situated in the recesses of each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works.

Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. and the situation: A team of geologists studied two islands. Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity. Answer the following question: Which island displayed fewer seismic waves? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background and situation, the island that displayed fewer seismic waves is Small island. This conclusion is drawn from the information that Small island presented almost no seismic activity, which indicates that fewer seismic waves were generated and observed in comparison to Large island. Seismic activity is directly related to the presence of seismic waves, as these waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake's focus. As Large island had a lot of seismic activity, it can be inferred that there was a higher number of seismic waves associated with the earthquakes occurring on and around the island. The study of seismic waves helps geologists to understand Earth's interior and the composition of different materials beneath the surface. On Large island, with more seismic activity, geologists would have access to more data through the analysis of numerous seismic waves, enabling them to better comprehend the island's geological composition and potentially gain insights into the reasons for its increased seismic activity. On the other hand, Small island's lack of noticeable seismic activity would result in fewer seismic waves for geologists to analyze. This could make it more challenging to study the island's interior structure and composition based on seismic wave data alone. However, the absence of considerable seismic activity might also suggest a more stable geological framework beneath Small island or different geological processes occurring in comparison to Large island. In summary, Small island displayed fewer seismic waves due to its minimal seismic activity, providing geologists with less information to study the inner structure of the island compared to Large island, which exhibited abundant seismic activity and consequently a higher number of seismic waves."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Iraq LEADER_NAME Fuad Masum","output":"Iraq's President, Fuad Masum, exemplifies dedicated leadership in navigating the nation's complex political landscape for a brighter future."},{"instruction":"you have a strong stomach.

A more detailed and accurate answer would be: A raster image, also known as a bitmap, is a digital image represented by a grid of individual pixels or points of color. The term \\"raster\\" is derived from the process of scanning cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, which scan horizontally across the display to create images by varying the intensity of the electron beam. In the context of digital images, raster refers to the manner in which image data is stored and displayed, with each pixel having its own color value. Raster images are widely used in digital photography, video games, and graphic design due to their ability to represent complex and detailed images. However, raster images are resolution-dependent, which means that their quality can deteriorate when scaled up or down. This is because the pixel grid has a fixed size, and resizing the image requires new pixels to be interpolated, or guessed, based on the surrounding pixels. Raster wiki might refer to the concept of raster graphics from a Wiki source such as Wikipedia or another collaborative, user-edited platform. In this case, you can find information on raster graphics, their characteristics, and their applications in digital imaging. Depending on the wiki platform, you might also learn about file formats associated with raster images, such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF, as well as software programs that enable users to work with raster images like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP."},{"instruction":"Title: The Help is excellent Product review: This movie is fascinating and a powerful look at our mid-20th century culture.

Options: - motion sickness - jet lag - relocation - fatigue - anxious Hmmm, let me think.","output":"When traveling to a new time zone, the most common phenomenon experienced is jet lag. Jet lag, also known as time zone change syndrome or desynchronosis, occurs when the body's internal clock is disrupted by crossing multiple time zones. This internal clock, or circadian rhythm, regulates various bodily functions such as sleep, wakefulness, digestion, and body temperature. Jet lag can cause several symptoms, including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, sleep disturbances (insomnia or excessive sleepiness), and gastrointestinal issues. These symptoms generally result from the misalignment between a person's internal clock and the local time at their destination. Although motion sickness, relocation, fatigue, and anxiety can occur during travel, they are not specific to traveling to a new time zone. Motion sickness is related to the perception of movement, while relocation is the act of moving to a new place. Fatigue can be caused by various factors such as lack of sleep, stress, and long travel duration, while anxiety during travel can also stem from multiple factors such as fear of flying, lack of familiarity with the destination, or social stress."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: How would a human be feeling if they were smiling and whistling?

Here's a comprehensive guide to help you understand, design, and utilize placemats effectively: 1. Determine the purpose: First, establish the primary purpose of the placemats. Are they intended for a special event, a specific theme, or everyday use? This will help you choose appropriate colors, materials, and designs to either match or enhance your table setting. 2. Choose the right material: Placemats are made from a variety of different materials, such as linen, cotton, vinyl, bamboo, paper, silicone, or cork. Each material has its own pros and cons: - Linen and cotton: These natural fiber options are soft, absorbent, and eco-friendly. They may be more suitable for formal settings or special occasions, as they have a more luxurious feel. They are also machine-washable and reusable. - Vinyl, silicone, and other synthetic materials: These are ideal for casual and outdoor settings, as they're easy to clean, waterproof, and usually stain-resistant. However, they can become damaged when exposed to high temperatures. - Bamboo and cork: Both materials offer a unique, natural look and are environmentally friendly. Bamboo placemats tend to be easy to clean with a damp cloth, while cork placemats provide a non-slip surface and heat resistance. 3. Consider size and shape: The standard placemat size is about 12x18 inches for rectangular or oblong placemats. However, placemats also come in round, square, and oval shapes to suit various table sizes and settings. Measure your table and ensure that the chosen placemat dimensions fit comfortably, leaving enough space between each setting. 4. Design and aesthetics: Whether you opt for solid colors, patterns, or themed designs, ensure that your chosen placemats complement your table setting, tableware, and overall décor. Consider the color scheme, textures, and styles of your dining area, and select placemats that either harmonize or contrast effectively with these elements. 5. Durability and maintenance: Opt for durable materials that can withstand regular wear and tear, especially if using them daily. It's also necessary to choose placemats that are easy to clean and maintain, saving you time and effort in the long run. 6. Layering and coordination: If desired, consider layering your placemats with coordinating elements such as tablecloths, chargers, and table runners. Layering adds depth, dimension, and visual interest to the table setting. 7. Proper placement: Place the placemats at each seat, typically one inch away from the table's edge, ensuring each guest has enough space to eat comfortably. Besides reflecting your style preferences, proper placement helps protect the table surface from spills, scratches, and heat. 8. Matching accessories: For a more cohesive look, consider coordinating your placemats with matching or complementary napkins, napkin rings, and tableware. This helps to create harmony and balance within the table setting. In conclusion, the best way to create and use placemats involves determining their purpose, choosing the right materials and size, considering the design and aesthetics, focusing on durability and maintenance, layering and coordinating when desired, placing them correctly, and accessorizing to create a cohesive look. By following these guidelines, you can ensure a visually appealing and functional placemat experience for any occasion."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"When painting a room and setting aside a small amount of paint for touch-ups, it is important to ensure that the paint will be available and in good condition when needed. Here are four solutions to consider - two which are more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning and two that are less sound. More sound solutions: 1. Sealing the paint in a small airtight container: To keep a small amount of paint for future touch-ups, you can use a clean and empty airtight container, such as a mason jar or plastic container with a screw-on lid. Pour the required amount of paint into the container, ensuring that it is big enough to accommodate your paintbrush for later use. Seal the container tightly to prevent air exposure, which can cause the paint to dry out or develop a film over time. This solution is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it effectively prevents paint from drying out and ensures its quality is maintained for future touch-ups. 2. Using a touch-up paint pen: A touch-up paint pen is a handy and practical tool designed specifically for small paint touch-ups. These pens typically come with a fine brush or point for precise application. To use a touch-up paint pen, fill it with the paint you wish to save for touch-ups before cleaning up the job site. Seal the pen tightly to prevent air exposure and store it in a cool, dry place. This solution is also sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it keeps the paint in a small, easy-to-use container that keeps the paint fresh and prevents drying. Less sound solutions: 1. Storing paint in the original can without sealing properly: Some people might choose to keep the excess paint in its original can and store it for future touch-ups. While this may work with proper sealing, it is less sound in terms of naive physics reasoning if the can's lid is not sealed correctly. A poorly-sealed paint can will allow air to enter and may cause the paint to dry out, form a skin, or separate, making it unsuitable for touch-ups. 2. Pouring leftover paint into a plastic bag: Pouring excess paint into a plastic bag may seem like a convenient solution, but it is less sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. A plastic bag isn't designed to hold paint for an extended period and can easily get punctured or torn, causing the paint to leak. Additionally, it's challenging to seal a plastic bag properly, so the paint may get exposed to air, leading to drying or contamination. In conclusion, the more sound solutions for setting aside a small amount of paint for touch-ups include sealing the paint in an airtight container or using a touch-up paint pen. These methods are more effective in preserving the paint's quality and ensuring successful and hassle-free touch-ups in the future."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: beach, coastline, north, view","output":"Alright, here is the task flow: 1.

In January 1595, the king declared war on Spain to show Catholics that Spain was using religion as a cover for an attack on the French state—and to show Protestants that his conversion had not made him a puppet of Spain. Also, he hoped to take the war to Spain and make territorial gain. The conflict mostly consisted of military action aimed at League members, such as the Battle of Fontaine-Française, though the Spanish launched a concerted offensive in 1595, taking Doullens, Cambrai and Le Catelet and in the spring of 1596 capturing Calais by April. Following the Spanish capture of Amiens in March 1597 the French crown laid siege until its surrender in September. With that victory Henry's concerns then turned to the situation in Brittany where he promulgated the Edict of Nantes and sent Bellièvre and Brulart de Sillery to negotiate a peace with Spain.

If you have built your own whelping box, you may have used wood or cardboard for the bottom. These materials are not easy to keep clean.","output":"To maintain a sanitary environment for both the mother and her puppies, it is crucial to clean and disinfect the whelping box regularly throughout the day. Start by removing any soiled materials, such as dirty bedding, feces, or uneaten food. Use gloves and disinfecting wipes to clean surfaces of the box, paying special attention to corners and crevices where dirt and bacteria may accumulate. Once you have wiped down the box with disinfectant, allow it to air-dry completely before replacing the bedding with fresh, clean materials. While performing these cleaning tasks, ensure the mother and her puppies are safely placed in another clean area to minimize stress and prevent accidental contact with cleaning chemicals. Monitoring the whelping box's humidity levels and temperature is essential in preventing the growth of harmful bacteria and ensuring the puppies' comfort. Regularly check for any dampness in the bedding and replace it immediately if necessary. Using a combination of absorbent puppy pads and soft, washable blankets can make this process more manageable, as you can layer the puppy pads underneath the blankets. This will allow you to easily remove and replace soiled pads without disturbing the entire nesting area. In addition to maintaining the cleanliness of the whelping box, it is essential to frequently groom the mother and her puppies. This includes gently brushing the mother's coat to remove any dirt or shedding hair and cleaning the puppies' sensitive areas with a damp, soft cloth. Keep an eye out for any signs of infections, such as redness, swelling, or discharge in the puppies' eyes, ears, and genital areas. If you notice any symptoms or if the mother appears to be in distress, do not hesitate to consult with your veterinarian immediately. If you are fostering a litter that has not yet been weaned, it is important to handle the puppies with care and keep human contact to a minimum to avoid causing unnecessary stress to both the mother and her young. When entering the whelping area, wear disposable shoe covers and consider changing your clothes to minimize the chance of introducing harmful contaminants from the outside environment. Finally, establish a regular routine for cleaning and sanitizing the whelping box to ensure it remains a safe, clean environment for all its occupants. By taking the time and effort to keep the whelping box clean, you are not only providing the mother and her puppies a comfortable space, but also contributing to the puppies' overall health and well-being, setting them up for a lifetime of happiness with their future forever families."},{"instruction":"Data: Indian Air Force AIRCRAFT_HELICOPTER HAL Light Combat Helicopter; Agra Airport LOCATION Uttar Pradesh; Agra Airport OPERATING_ORGANISATION Indian Air Force; Uttar Pradesh IS_PART_OF Bundelkhand What would a sentence about this data be like?","output":"At the Agra Airport in Uttar Pradesh, which is a part of the Bundelkhand region, the Indian Air Force operates the HAL Light Combat Helicopter for their missions and activities."},{"instruction":"Process: - Bees first secure the perfect spot, such as hollow areas of trees - Bees will begin to chew max until it becomes softened - The chewed up wax will be stored inside of a honeycomb - Worker bees continue chewing and softening wax from within - The chewed up wax is steadily added, making the hive bigger and bigger - The bees will house nectar, honey and pollen within the honeycomb's cells - Question: suppose more wax is chewed happens, how will it affect a SMALLER hive.

Nikita Morrison, 13, was in a French lesson when she put the bottle of Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy on her desk while unpacking her school books. But teachers immediately confiscated the 500ml drink and within minutes she was sent home after being excluded for three days. Controversy: Nikita Morrison, 13, who has been suspended from Gloucester Academy for bringing in the drink. She claims staff at Gloucester Academy considered the soft drink to be alcohol - despite the product’s website stating it is suitable for children. The alcohol content of the drink is less than 0.5 per cent - not enough to legally qualify as an intoxicating liquor and it is sold in the soft drinks aisle in shops. Ms Morrison, who has never been excluded before, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. ‘You see kids at school drinking it all the time, even the Year 7s, there is nothing wrong with it. ‘The teachers told me I wasn’t allowed to bring it into school because it is lager. I told them it was pop but they just wouldn’t listen.’ Anger: Nikita's mother, Amanda (right), has described her suspension as 'absurd' and complained that she is now behind with her lessons. Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy contains 12 per cent beer but is sold in the soft drink aisle in shops. No ID is needed to buy it and it is officially classed as a soft drink by the UK Food Standards Agency. Her mother Amanda, 38, said the incident on Wednesday was ‘absolutely ludicrous’. ‘It is absurd, the staff were saying it was alcohol. ‘She has missed quite a few lessons now, it is ridiculous. She is special needs so she is dropping behind even more. Safe: The shandy that Ms Morrison brought into school contains less than 0.5 per cent alcohol and is sold in the soft drinks sections of shops. ‘It find it absolutely ludicrous that she is missing out on education because of a bottle of pop. ‘Despite the fact we have explained, and proven, that it is not alcohol the school won’t listen at all.’ The stay-at-home mum-of-nine added: ‘There is nothing wrong with taking that drink into school at all. ‘I tried to explain that it was my mistake and I bought it from the supermarket but that was not good enough.’ Alan Armstrong, interim headteacher at Gloucester Academy, defended the exclusion. He said: ‘This school and all schools never exclude a student lightly or for trivial reasons. Schools have a duty of care to ensure all students are kept safe.’ A Ben Shaw’s spokesman said: ‘Shandies with less than 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume are defined as soft drinks and as such have no restriction on their sale or consumption. ‘All products we manufacture under the shandy name are less than 0.5 per cent and this is stated on labelling.’ Highlights:","output":"1. 13-year-old Nikita Morrison was suspended from Gloucester Academy after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager. 2.

Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital.

Believing she's dead, Gill dumps Rae and leaves her for dead in only a shirt and panties by the side of the road and drives away. Lazarus discovers Rae unconscious in the road the next morning and brings her home to nurse her back to health. Lazarus goes to see Tehronne (David Banner) - the man who Lazarus thought had beaten her - and learns of her promiscuity. Over the course of several days, Rae, delirious with fever, occasionally wakes up and tries to flee from Lazarus. He chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away. After Rae regains her wits, Lazarus announces that it is his spiritual duty to heal her of her sinful ways and refuses to release her until he does so.

He sailed to Cartagena and joined the fleet of Martin Fernandez de Enciso and, in 1513, accompanied Balboa to the Pacific. In 1514, he found a supporter in Pedro Arias Davila, the Governor of Castilla de Oro and was rewarded for his role in the arrest of Balboa with the positions of mayor and magistrate in Panama City, serving from 1519 to 1523. Reports of Peru's riches and Cortes's success in Mexico tantalized Pizarro. He undertook two expeditions to conquer the Incan Empire in 1524 and in 1526. Both failed as a result of native hostilities, bad weather and lack of provisions. Pedro de los Rios, the Governor of Panama, made an effort to recall Pizarro, but the conquistador resisted and remained in the south. In April 1528, he reached northern Peru and found the natives rich with precious metals. This discovery gave Pizarro the motivation to plan a third expedition to conquer the area. He returned to Panama to make arrangements, but the Governor refused to grant permission for the project. Pizarro returned to Spain to appeal directly to King Charles I. His plea was successful and he received not only a license for the proposed expedition, but also authority over any lands conquered during the venture. He was joined by family and friends and the expedition left Panama in 1530. When hostile natives along the coast threatened the expedition, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, San Miguel de Piura. Atahualpa refused to tolerate a Spanish presence in his lands, but was captured by Pizarro during the Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. A ransom for the emperor's release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed him on 26 July 1533, overriding his associates who thought he was overstepping his authority. The same year, Pizarro entered the Inca capital of Cuzco and completed his conquest of Peru. In January 1535, Pizarro founded the city of Lima, a project he considered his greatest achievement. Quarrels between Pizarro and his longtime comrade-in-arms Diego Almagro culminated in the Battle of Las Salinas. Almagro was captured and executed and, on 26 June 1541, his embittered son, Diego de Almagro \\"el mozo\\", assassinated Pizarro in Lima.

In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW. While universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980’s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself? David Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold’s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it’s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making.

Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\".

When the visitor persists on coming in, Sarah, a professional photographer, attempts to take her photo through a window and telephones the police. When they arrive, the woman has already vanished. The police assure Sarah that she will be fine, but arrange to have a patrol car visit throughout the night. Upon developing her photos, Sarah recognizes the woman in the background of an earlier photo she had taken, indicating she was stalking Sarah. Sarah telephones her employer, asking to have the photos enhanced. As she goes to bed, the woman arrives in the bedroom, awakening Sarah with scissors puncturing her pregnant belly. Sarah fights the visitor off and locks herself in the bathroom, where the woman tries to gain entry. The woman makes clear that her intentions are to take Sarah's child for herself. Sarah's employer arrives, and not knowing what Sarah's mother looks like, takes the strange woman's word that she is the mother. Later her actual mother arrives, arousing the employer's suspicion.

Hello little friends! Today, we’re going to learn about two important groups: The British and the Spanish soldiers from a long time ago. These groups had big armies with many soldiers, but one had less than the other. Let's find out who had fewer troops! The British and the Spanish are known for being strong and powerful. But did you know that an army needs a lot of people called troops? Just like when you and your friends make a big team to play a game, the British and the Spanish had their own teams with lots of soldiers! In some points of history, the British and the Spanish were friends, but sometimes they didn't get along very well. They had to use their armies to protect their countries and make sure their people were safe and happy. Now, to answer the question: Which group had less troops - the British or the Spanish? We have to remember that the number of troops in an army can change over time, and it depends on when and where the soldiers were needed. But if we look at the time when the British and the Spanish were not friends, and they were competing to win more land around the world, especially in the famous battles, like the one in 1588 called the \\"Spanish Armada,\\" we can see that the British had fewer troops than the Spanish. In that time, the Spanish Armada was made up of many ships and a lot more soldiers than the British navy. However, the British were very clever and used the smaller size of their navy to their advantage. They surprised the Spanish and they were faster because of their smaller number. So, in conclusion, even though there were times when the number of troops could have been different, in the times when the British and Spanish faced each other in battle, the British usually had fewer troops than the Spanish. Remember, kids, sometimes having a smaller team doesn't mean you'll always lose; it's all about how you work together and use your strengths! Now you know that the British had fewer troops than the Spanish, and you can share this fun fact with your friends!"},{"instruction":"Background: Krishnan Nair (25 July 1939 - 16 November 1980), better known by his stage name Jayan, was an Indian film actor, naval officer, stunt performer and cultural icon of the 1970s. He starred in over 120 Malayalam films. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his macho image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing stunts of a dangerous nature on his own. Context: In the late 1990s and early 21st century, there was a resurgence of Jayan's screen persona in Kerala and his old movie scenes came to prominence again. It was owed mostly to programs by popular mimicry stage artists in the State, whose imitations of the star's mannerisms caught on and soon became commonplace in college stage events, television programs and mimicry stage shows along with quotes of superhuman strength known as Jayan quotes. However, it has been pointed out that many grotesquely imitated screen dialogues of Jayan are not actually his, but that of dubbing artist Aleppey Ashraf, who dubbed for many of his characters after his death. The \\"comeback\\" of Jayan and his renewed popularity lately may be taken as an affirmation that Jayan has not been replaced even nearly three decades after his death. Today, Jayan is best remembered as the first and best action star of Malayalam cinema, so far, besides his trademark colourful attire, risky stunts, machismo mannerisms and unique speaking style. He has rightly won immortality in the hearts of the Malayalam film fans as a martyr in his yearning to thrill and entertain them even by putting his life at stake. Madhu, a famous actor prominent in the 1960s, once stated in an interview: \\"Jayan will forever be young and alive. No one can ever visualise him as an old man.\\" A film titled Avatharam presently under production, is attempting to bring back his screen persona using advanced technologies. A documentary on Jayan's life and death Jayan - The Man behind the Legend is nearing completion for release in the near future. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Answer: Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article: 1. Jayan's career transformation: Jayan was a naval officer before he became an Indian film actor. It is fascinating to see how he transitioned from a naval officer to a successful actor and stunt performer. 2. Posthumous popularity: Even after his death, Jayan's on-screen persona experienced a resurgence in Kerala, thanks to mimicry artists and stage performers who imitated his mannerisms and style. This attests to his lasting popularity and the impact he had on Malayalam film fans. 3. Dubbing artist Aleppey Ashraf: Many of the imitated screen dialogues attributed to Jayan are actually the work of dubbing artist Aleppey Ashraf, who dubbed for Jayan's characters after his death. 4. First and best action star of Malayalam cinema: Jayan is considered the first and best action star of Malayalam cinema, well-known for his risky stunts, machismo mannerisms, and unique style. 5. Tributes and projects dedicated to Jayan: A film titled Avatharam, which uses advanced technologies to bring back Jayan's screen persona, and a documentary called Jayan - The Man behind the Legend are two examples of projects that aim to honor and remember his life and legacy."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a grad-school level question?","output":"A grad-school level question typically requires an in-depth understanding of a subject matter, analytical thinking, and the ability to synthesize information from various resources.

Discuss the key theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence supporting and contesting these influences.\\" To answer this question, one would need to: 1. Provide an overview of international trade and economic globalization: - Define international trade and economic globalization. - Discuss the evolution of global trade and economic integration over time, considering global market liberalization, the role of international institutions, and major trade agreements. 2. Discuss the relationship between international trade, globalization, and income inequality: - Explain the key theoretical perspectives, such as the classical trade theory (Ricardo, Heckscher-Ohlin) and their implications for income distribution (i.e., Stolper-Samuelson theorem). - Introduce alternative and more recent theories, like the new-new trade theory, which account for firm heterogeneity, monopolistic competition, and endogenous productivity differences. 3. Assess empirical evidence on trade openness and income inequality: - Present studies that show a positive relationship between trade liberalization and income inequality, focusing on within-country analysis (skill-biased technological change, wage premium for skilled labor, and employment shifting). - Discuss the empirical evidence suggesting that international trade can reduce income disparities between countries (the convergence hypothesis) while acknowledging mixed findings and the role of country-specific factors like education, infrastructure, and governance. 4. Consider the impact of economic globalization beyond international trade: - Address the influence of financial globalization, foreign direct investment, and migration on income inequality, considering both the winners and losers of the process. - Explore the role of global value chains as a driving force behind income disparities, as well as the implications of the gig economy and digital platforms on labor markets and wage distribution. 5. Discuss the role of policies in mitigating the potential adverse effects of trade and globalization on income inequality: - Analyze the importance of social protection, labor market interventions, and redistributive fiscal policies in addressing income disparities. - Examine the role of trade and industrial policies in promoting skill upgrading, technology diffusion, and domestic productivity growth. - Assess the potential effectiveness and limitations of international cooperation to tackle inequality globally. 6. Conclude with a synthesis of the main findings and the implications for globalization and international trade policy: - Summarize the key theoretical and empirical evidence on the link between international trade, economic globalization, and income inequality. - Offer insights on the need for a balanced approach to harnessing the benefits of globalization while mitigating its potential adverse effects on income distribution. - Discuss the implications for trade policy, domestic policy, and international cooperation in addressing income inequality in an era of increasing global integration."},{"instruction":"Jessica, Attached are the Agreement for both Suzanne and Diane.

While celebrating his most recent success, he is approached by his colleague Nathan 'Nate' Roenick (Guilfoyle) who warns him that large sums of money are being embezzled from the Chicago Police Department's disability fund of which Roman is on the board. Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling.

The Giallorossi are now four points behind the reigning champions as they continue in their pursuit of silverware this season. This unanticipated result has sent shockwaves among Roma's supporters, raising questions about their team's potency in front of goal. The Match: Empoli, placed in the lower echelons of Serie A, put up an unexpectedly strong defense against a heavily favored Roma side. The home team's determination and resolve to keep a clean sheet were evident throughout the 90 minutes of the match. Defying the odds, Empoli's backline prevented Roma from capitalizing on their attacking prowess and creating meaningful chances throughout the game. Roma's manager, Luciano Spalletti, fielded a strong starting XI in anticipation of a routine victory but was left frustrated as his team failed to break through Empoli's rigid defensive setup. To Empoli's credit, they managed to keep Roma's attacking threats under control, limiting the number of clear-cut chances for the visitors. Investigating the Draw: A closer look at the statistics reveal that Roma dominated the proceedings with a superior possession rate, however, they struggled to create significant opportunities to score. Empoli, on the other hand, focused on maintaining their defensive shape and discipline, showcasing the growing tactical maturity of their squad. The struggle for the Giallorossi to secure a win against a team fighting for their Serie A survival further highlights the unpredictable nature of football. While the draw could be perceived as a missed opportunity for Roma to close the gap with Juventus, it also demonstrates that there are no easy matches in Serie A, even against the so-called lesser teams. Impact on Serie A Title Race: The goalless draw means that Roma now trail Juventus by four points in the title race. Although there's still a substantial number of matches left to be played, Roma's title aspirations have taken a hit with this draw. Fans and pundits alike will be keeping a keen eye on the remainder of the season to see if Roma can bounce back from this setback and keep the pressure on Juventus. Conclusion: Roma's failure to secure a victory against Empoli has injected uncertainty into Serie A's title race. The unexpected result serves as a reminder that there are no guarantees in football, and the Giallorossi must regroup and refocus on their title pursuit. With several key matchups still to come, Roma will need to learn from this encounter and maintain the consistency required to challenge for the Serie A crown. Only time will tell if this draw was a minor blip or a turning point in Roma's season."},{"instruction":"The game started out slow for both the Texans and Chiefs, but with Kansas City poised to score first, rookie placekicker Justin Medlock missed a 30-yard field goal.

This is because a higher viral load (more contact with the virus) increases the number of viral particles entering the body, allowing the virus to spread to a greater number of cells and potentially cause more damage. Step by step: 1. More contact is made with a virus - This increases the viral load entering the human or animal body. 2. The virus enters the human or animal body - With a higher viral load, there are more viral particles present to infect cells. 3. The virus goes to the part of the body that contains its food - The increased viral load means more virus particles are present to reach parts of the body where they can replicate. 4. The virus consumes part of the body or materials that the body uses - With more virus particles present, more cells and resources are likely to be utilized by the virus for replication. 5. The virus replicates and spreads - With more virus particles present, they can potentially infect and damage a larger number of cells. 6. The virus causes symptoms in the body as the immune system tries to expel the virus - With more cells being damaged, the immune system response may be more significant, potentially leading to more noticeable symptoms. Therefore, more contact with a virus leads to more cells being damaged, not less, due to the increased viral load.

After graduating from Oxford University he went on to the real thing. In the 1980s, scientists were already communicating using a primitive version of e-mail. While working at a laboratory in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a program, which let him store these messages. This gave him another idea: write a program that will let academics from across the world share information on a single place. In 1990 he wrote the HTTP and HTML programs which form the basis of the World Wide Web. The next year his programs were placed on to the Internet. Everyone was welcome to use them and improve them if they could. Programmers used this codes to work with different operating systems. New things like web browsers and search engines were developed. Between 1991 and 1994 the number of web pages rose from 10 to 100,000. In 1994 Tim Berners-Lee formed the newly formed World Wide Web consortium , or W3C. More than 200 leading companies and laboratories are represented by W3C.

At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat.

Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply.

Step 2: Identify the information provided by the hypothesis The hypothesis tells us that the wrestler's opponent is lying on the ground, and there are onlookers watching the match. This adds more context to the scene, but it is not directly addressed in the premise. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis information When comparing the premise and hypothesis, we see that they provide different details about the wrestling match situation. The premise focuses on one wrestler's position, while the hypothesis provides information about the opponent's position and the presence of an audience. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to assess if the information provided in the premise guarantees that the hypothesis is true. In this case, the premise does not directly mention the opponent lying on the ground or onlookers watching the match. Therefore, we cannot deduce that the hypothesis is necessarily true based on the premise alone. Conclusion: No, we do not know that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise only provides information about one wrestler's position in the ring, and we cannot conclude anything about the opponent's position or the presence of an audience based on this information alone."},{"instruction":"Information: - A guided-missile destroyer is a destroyer designed to launch guided missiles. Many are also equipped to carry out anti-submarine, anti-air, and anti-surface operations. The NATO standard designation for these vessels is DDG. Nations vary in their use of destroyer D designation in their hull pennant numbering, either prefixing, or dropping it altogether. The U.S. Navy has adopted the classification DDG in the American hull classification system. - The 18 Forrest Sherman - class destroyers were the first US post-war destroyers ( DD - 927 to DD - 930 were completed as destroyer leaders ) . Commissioned beginning in 1953 , these ships served until the late 1980s . Their weaponry underwent considerable modification during their years of service . Four were converted to guided missile destroyers . This class also served as the basis for the Charles F. Adams - class guided missile destroyer . Three ships of the class have become museum ships , nine have been sunk in training exercises , and the others have been scrapped or are scheduled to be scrapped . - The Russo-Japanese War (8 February 1904 5 September 1905) was fought between the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea, Japan and the Yellow Sea. - In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers. They were originally developed in the late 19th century as a defence against torpedo boats, and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these \\"torpedo boat destroyers\\" (TBD) were \\"large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats.\\" Although the term \\"destroyer\\" had been used interchangeably with \\"TBD\\" and \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\" by navies since 1892, the term \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\" had been generally shortened to simply \\"destroyer\\" by nearly all navies by the First World War. - Destroyer Leader (DL) was the United States Navy designation for large destroyers from 9 February 1951 through the early years of the cold war. United States ships with hull classification symbol DL were officially frigates from 1 January 1955 until 1975. The smaller destroyer leaders were reclassified as destroyers and the larger as cruisers by the United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification; so destroyer escorts could be reclassified as frigates (FF) in conformance with international usage of the term. Background. By the end of World War I the destroyers intended to screen formations of battleships had evolved to a displacement of approximately 1100 tons armed with four guns and six or more torpedoes. Italy had built three \\"esploratori\\" (scout cruisers) approximately 70% larger than contemporary destroyers. The Washington Naval Treaty encouraged United Kingdom satisfaction with its traditional fleet of s and United States contentment with similar and s, while the signatories with smaller fleets explored alternative warship configurations between the classical definitions of destroyer and cruiser. Italy launched three more \\"esploratori\\" and France responded with six \\"Chacal\\"-class \\"contre-torpilleur\\" super destroyers. Japan launched the minimum light cruiser followed by the \\"Fubuki\\"-class special type destroyers with endurance to escort the \\"Kido Butai\\" mobile force of aircraft carriers over the wide reaches of the Pacific. - In the Royal Navy and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations, ships are identified by pennant number (an internationalisation of \\"pendant number\\", which it was called before 1948). Historically, naval ships flew a flag that identified a flotilla or type of vessel. For example, the Royal Navy used a red burgee for torpedo boats and a pennant with an H for torpedo boat destroyers. Adding a number to the type-identifying flag uniquely identified each ship. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'operator'. Answer:","output":"In the context of the information provided, the subject entity is the \\"United States Navy\\" and the object entity is the \\"Forrest Sherman-class destroyers\\" and \\"destroyer leader (DL)\\" vessels. The relation of 'operator' exists because the United States Navy is the organization responsible for operating and maintaining these types of naval vessels."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

Question: If you can't stop damage to the brain, you can help what? Context: Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.

One of the following sentences is nonsensical. Which one is it?

An elephant is a large mammal native to Africa and Asia, and they typically inhabit areas such as savannas, grasslands, and swamps. Although elephants can sometimes be found near the edges of forests, they are not typically considered forest animals due to their size and preferred habitats. On the other hand, Sentence B: \\"You may find an anteater in the forest\\" makes more sense. Anteaters are native to Central and South America, and they inhabit various habitats, including forests, savannas, and grasslands. They're known for eating ants and termites, which can be found abundantly in forest environments. So, it is more likely that you may find an anteater in the forest than an elephant. However, it's essential to consider that context might change the meaning or interpretation of each sentence. For example, the presence of an elephant in an Asian tropical forest wouldn't be as nonsensical. But based on the limited information and a general comparison of the two sentences, Sentence A is relatively more nonsensical."},{"instruction":"Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law.

She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next.

She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

Answer:","output":"The Germans, as an ethnic group, primarily originated from the region known as Germania, an area spanning across Central Europe and Northern Europe in early history. Their origin dates back to antiquity, specifically the Iron Age, but their history and development have been shaped by various historical events and cultural influences over the centuries. Germanic tribes, which included the Germans, can be traced back to around 750 BCE. Initially, these tribes shared a common Proto-Germanic language and cultural traits. Over time, they differentiated into more distinct groups, like the Goths, Lombards, Vandals, Angles, Saxons, and others. The Germanic tribes migrated, raided, and settled in different parts of Europe during late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. Additionally, their interactions with the Roman Empire significantly influenced their culture and expansion. The establishment of the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe during the Middle Ages shaped the development of both the German identity and language. Later, during the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, different German regions came under the influence of Catholicism and Protestantism, each with their distinctive regional dialects, customs, and worldviews. The emergence of Prussia as a leading German-speaking state in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the eventual unification of the various German realms under the German Empire in 1871, consolidated the process of modern German nation-building. In summary, the Germans originated from Germania, an area encompassing parts of Central and Northern Europe, and evolved through a combination of various historical events and cultural exchanges. Over time, they developed into distinctive tribes and states before uniting under the German Empire, ultimately forming the modern German nation."},{"instruction":"Title: more of a mystery than a sci fi Review: the book is one part scifi and three part mystery/thriller.

Associated Press. A Washington state grandmother could lose an eye after she bravely rescued her grandson who was being viciously attacked by an otter as he swam in a river on Thursday. Roxane Leilani Grove's grandmotherly instinct kicked in as soon as she heard the screams of her 8-year-old grandson, Bryce Moser, and then saw the horrible sight of an otter biting him aggressively in a swimming hole in the Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle. 'I could see that it was biting into his head and it had its claws around him,' Grove told KOMO News. Scroll down for video. Attacked: Roxane Leilani Grove and her grandson Bryce Moser, left, with their injuries from an otter attack at Pilchuck River, Washington. 'I just. swam out there and I grabbed the claws to pull it off of him. 'I just remember trying to hold it as tight as I can and yelling \\"Get. him out of the water! Get him out of the water!\\"' Grove managed to get young Bryce out of the water but not before suffering her own injuries. 'It just started biting on me and biting on me and it felt like little knives just going in,' Grove told the TV station. The. pair were taken to a hospital where Grove reportedly received hundreds. of stitches to her face and head as well as the eye injury and Bryce. received nine staples in his head. State. and federal wildlife agents in Washington are trying to trap the otter. and it will likely be killed unless it is a female with pups, because it. has pounced on people, said Capt. Alan Myers of the Washington. Department of Fish and Wildlife. 'We're doing everything possible to capture than animal as soon as possible,' Myers said Friday. 'This is an extremely rare incident. Otters are not known to be aggressive toward people.' The boy's mother, Tabitha Moser, saw the four-foot otter attack her son and her mother saved him. A state worker was unable to find the otter, so expert trappers were called in from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services, Myers said. They'll try to trap it with a foot snare or tranquilize it. 'We're not sure if it's a hyper-aggressive male protecting territory or a female protecting its young,' Myers said. An eight-year-old boy and his grandmother were attacked by an otter in Washington's Pilchuck River. 'There's a lot of liability in trying to relocate an animal that's been hyper-aggressive, and it would likely be euthanized. If it's a female with pups, there's another possible outcome if we can find a good location.' But the otter would have to be killed in any case so its brain could be tested for rabies, if that's a concern for doctors treating the boy and his grandmother, he said. 'There are no known cases of otter rabies in Washington,; he said. 'That's an extremely remote possibility.' The grandmother was treated at Harborview. Medical Center in Seattle and the boy at Providence Medical Center in. Everett, the boy's mother, Tabitha Moser told KING. The attack took place in Washington's Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle (pictured) 'All of a sudden I just heard him scream for his life. He was just bobbing up and down in the water and as he came up there was something all the way on top of his head,' she told KING. The otter continued to attack as they left the water. 'Even after it got into the river and out of our way it stood on its hind legs looking at us like, 'Don't do it again; don't come in here,'' she told KING. Myers said he has not heard of any other otter attacks in Washington but there have been some around the country.

With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family is enjoying a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check on Azaria and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches. When she discovers the infant is missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success. It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying off the child, and a subsequent inquest rules her account of events is true.The tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains. For many, Lindy seems too stoic, too cold-hearted, and too accepting of the disaster that has befallen her. Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact. The couple's beliefs are not widely practised in the country, and when the media reports a rumour that the name Azaria means \\"sacrifice in the wilderness\\" (when in fact it means \\"blessed of God\\"), the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite.

But if the Fruitvale, B.C., resident is asked by U.S. border agents if he's ever smoked marijuana, he knows what he's going to do. \\"I'm going to lie,\\" he said Tuesday. Larocque lives just north of B.C.'s border with Washington state, a boundary he crosses several times a year to reach his winter home in Arizona.​ But a report Monday — about Estevan, Sask., residents being refused entry into North Dakota after admitting to past cannabis use — has Larocque spooked about his next southbound trip next month. \\"I don't want to lie. And I'm going to lie. And that is unfortunate. Because I am a truthful person and I think most Canadians are,\\" he said. Larocque is worried about getting cut off from his second home. Still, he should rethink his plan, say lawyers consulted by CBC News. \\"Do not do that. Trust me,\\" said Henry Chang, a partner at the Toronto law firm Blaney McMurtry LLP who specializes in immigration law and practises in both Ontario and California. The repercussions of being caught lying to a U.S. border agent outweigh the potential gain of fibbing without detection, Chang said — namely, you could be permanently banned from entering the U.S. 'People don't understand' the rules: lawyer There are two other things that could get you banned from the U.S. in the post-Canadian legalization age, according to Chang. The first is a prior conviction for marijuana possession. The second is admitting to having used marijuana before its recreational use was legalized by the Canadian government on Oct. 17. Henry Chang, an immigration lawyer based in Toronto, says people can refuse to answer the question and seek American legal advice in the meantime. (Blaney McMurtry LLP) \\"If you say, 'Yeah, I smoked marijuana when I was 18, but it's not a problem, right?' — it is problem. You are barred for life, as if you had been convicted back then. People don't understand that,\\" said Chang. \\"Legalization doesn't cure prior problems,\\" he added. Medical marijuana users with a valid prescription who admit to using the drug won't be banned, Chang said, though they still can't import any marijuana into the U.S. What about recreational users who admit to doing marijuana after it was legalized? \\"It's not as black and white,\\" said Chang. If it was a one-time tryout by a curious newbie involving cannabis bought from a legal Canadian seller, \\"you should be OK,\\" he said. Medically examined for signs of addiction But a person who admits to using cannabis repeatedly could still be barred from entering the United States, said Chang. \\"If they conclude that you're a drug abuser [or addict], you're barred [on] that ground, separate and apart from whether it's legal or not.\\" That conclusion can't be reached, however, until a Canadian panel physician approved by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) examines someone following a detention. \\"You will be temporarily banned until you get the medical exam done,\\" said Chang, adding that the findings are shared directly with CBP, not with the patient. \\"If they tell you [at your next border trip] you're not getting in, you know what the medical exam said,\\" he said. People barred on this ground aren't necessarily banned for life, however, thanks to what Chang called a \\"remission provision.\\" The panel physician (either in Vancouver, Toronto or elsewhere) may re-examine someone and find they no longer meet the definition of addict or abuser. \\"But it can bar someone for several years until they have proven that they no longer use drugs, including legal cannabis,\\" said Chang. Andrew Mason, a Saskatoon defence lawyer, said people with past convictions for pot possession can obtain a waiver but it's a costly and 'cumbersome' process. (CBC) People with a prior pot possession conviction have an option too. They can apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a waiver (form I-192) that would essentially see the U.S. government overlook a past offence. People have to provide a criminal record check and references, pay a 1,200 Cdn fee and periodically get their waiver renewed. \\"It's a cumbersome process,\\" said Andrew Mason, a Saskatoon-based defence lawyer. And it's not to be confused with a pardon from the Canadian government, which may not do any good anyway, Mason added. \\"It doesn't erase the fact that you had committed the offence in the past.\\" Their advice? Delay Given all these strict rules, what should marijuana users do when questioned by border agents? \\"That's a question I get a lot,\\" said Chang. \\"It's a no-win situation for anyone who gets asked the question. \\"If you admit to using controlled substances prior to legalization, you are barred,\\" he continued. \\"If you lie and say you've never smoked it and they find out, it's a permanent bar for material misrepresentation, which is also quite serious.\\" Chang and Mason agree it's better to take a take a third, if imperfect, approach. Delay. \\"Refuse to answer the question. Say it's irrelevant. Say you don't know why this question is being asked,\\" said Chang. It won't get people to their destinations — and they'll merely be confronted with the same question next time — but at least they can consult a lawyer, he said. That lawyer may even be able to resolve the situation directly with CBP \\"without you having to make an actual admission,\\" said Chang. \\"Because once you've admitted it, it's done. You're barred. Nothing anybody can do except apply for a waiver.\\" A diplomatic solution Mason is hopeful another solution can be worked out. \\"I expect the governments of Canada and the U.S will get together and make it so that most people who have smoked it in the past but who are not likely to break U.S. drug laws will not be disallowed in the United States. \\"But that's going to take a bit of negotiation and discussion.\\" ||||| The Mayor of Estevan, Sask. is concerned that people trying to cross the border are being turned away for saying they have smoked marijuana in the past. “In a lot of cases people are being asked if they have smoked pot at the border and part of the problem is the people that have admitted to smoking and in some cases are being turned away, said Estevan Mayor Roy Ludwig. The mayor said he knows of a few cases already where people have been turned back and refused entry to the United States.

But Admitting To Using It Can Get You Banned From U.S. Enlarge this image toggle caption Brittany Greeson/The Washington Post/Getty Images Brittany Greeson/The Washington Post/Getty Images It's now legal for adults to smoke pot in Canada. But some Canadians have found themselves barred – possibly permanently – if they admit at the U.S. border that they have used marijuana. Estevan, Saskatchewan, is just 10 miles north of the border with North Dakota. The town's mayor, Roy Ludwig, told the CBC that residents have been turned away at the border for admitting to marijuana use. \\"It is a fairly serious concern,\\" Ludwig said. \\"Even people that might have smoked it 20, 30 years ago, they're being asked, 'Have you ever smoked cannabis?' when they get to the U.S. border. We understand some people have said yes, that they have, and have been turned back.\\" And the concern is not only that they won't be able to enter the U.S. once – but that they can be banned permanently. That's what happened to Bill Powers, a 57-year-old Canadian who has a medical marijuana license, The Los Angeles Times reported. Border agents asked if Powers had ever smoked pot before getting the license. When he said he had, he was labeled \\"inadmissible\\" and barred from entering the U.S. \\"I thought they were kidding,\\" he told the newspaper. \\"They're treating people like terrorists when all we did was admit to smoking some pot.\\" Customs and Border Protection was decidedly not kidding. Act 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act lists some 60 reasons why a non-U.S. citizen can be deemed ineligible to enter the the country. Those reasons range from being a money launderer to being a Nazi. A few of the reasons concern drugs, and can potentially apply at the border to non-U.S. citizens who admit to having used marijuana, depending on the situation. One blocks entry to noncitizens who are determined \\"to be a drug abuser or addict.\\" Another bars those who have been convicted of crimes involving controlled substances. A third bars those whom officers have reason to believe \\"is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance.\\" CBP spokesperson Stephanie Malin tells NPR that \\"on the U.S. side, nothing has changed.\\" Despite legalization in a number of U.S. states and the District of Columbia, marijuana remains a controlled substance under federal law. She says that every inspection is different, and not everyone will be asked about drug use. \\"However, if during the course of the inspection, there is reason for the officer to ask about it, they will. ... It comes down to the intent of the travel.\\" In October, CBP issued a statement regarding Canadians working in that country's legal cannabis industry. Canadians working in that industry in Canada may only travel legally to the U.S. if their travel does not involve the marijuana business. The Canadian government warns travelers that the U.S. \\"has a zero-tolerance policy and imposes severe penalties for the possession of even a small amount of an illegal drug.\\" The CBC reports that the Canadian government \\"will post signs at border crossings warning Canadians not to bring their legal marijuana into the U.S. — just as the Americans do for their citizens with signs informing them of Canada's strict firearms regime.\\" The CBP doesn't track how many Canadian citizens have been barred from entering the U.S. for marijuana-related reasons. But Malin says that the CBP has \\"not seen a noticeable spike\\" in Canadians turned away at the border this year. Canadians who are barred from entering for having used marijuana in the past may apply for a waiver. But they can be costly and cumbersome to attain, and must be renewed every five years. Henry Chang, a partner at Toronto law firm Blaney McMurtry who specializes in immigration law, advises pot-smoking Canadians to neither admit to marijuana use, nor lie about it. \\"Refuse to answer the question. Say it's irrelevant. Say you don't know why this question is being asked,\\" Chang told the CBC. They won't be able to enter the U.S. on that occasion, he says, but they will be able to go and consult with a lawyer who may be able to resolve the situation. Asked if the CBP's stance might be too severe, Malin says that her agency is simply enforcing U.S. immigration law. And while the law could change, she says, there is no indication that the agency will change how it enforces the current law. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a brief explanation of the main points or main ideas in a story, article, or text.

And I was wondering What will Others want to do next? Select from the following. A). send Kai pictures B). disown Kai C). spend more time with them","output":"It seems that Kai has formed a meaningful connection with his grandparents during his visit to the farm. Considering the emotional bond that has been established, the following choices present potential courses of action for others who care for Kai: A) Send Kai pictures: Sending Kai pictures could be a particularly heartwarming gesture. These photos could document memorable moments from the visit to the farm, thereby strengthening the bond he has formed with his grandparents. Additionally, the images will serve as keepsakes bridging the physical distance between Kai and the farm, helping him recall fond memories even when he is away. To effectively execute this option, consider the following steps: 1. Select and compile high-quality pictures that capture the essence of the visit. Include shots of the farm, the activities Kai engaged in, and family gatherings with his grandparents. 2. Organize the pictures into a digital album, and ensure they are appropriately labeled with dates, places, and names. Including captions and anecdotes might add a more personal touch. 3. Share the album with Kai using a suitable online platform or email. Alternatively, you could opt for a printed photo album that can be mailed to his address. B) Disown Kai: Given that Kai has developed a close connection with his grandparents, disowning him would not be an advisable action. Disowning a person can lead to significant emotional distress and would likely strain the family relationships. It is essential to nurture connections and support one another rather than severing ties. Therefore, this option is not recommended. C) Spend more time with them: Spending more time with Kai and his grandparents can certainly contribute to strengthening the bonds between everyone involved. Consider the following activities to maximize the benefits of this approach: 1. Participate in family gatherings: Organize regular get-togethers with Kai, his grandparents, and other family members. This will allow everyone to nurture relationships, create memories, and celebrate special occasions. 2. Share common hobbies: Encourage everyone to find new hobbies or engage in existing ones that all participants enjoy. Shared interests will foster stronger connections and produce lasting memories. 3. Engage in multi-generational activities: Embark on activities that can bridge the generational gap and cultivate an environment of open communication. This could include cooking, storytelling sessions, or even collaborating on a family project. 4. Communicate with each other frequently: Encourage everyone to maintain frequent contact through phone calls, video calls, and instant messaging. Regular communication can help keep relationships healthy and allow for better understanding of each individual's needs. Overall, option (C) seems to be the most effective and considerate course of action to take, with option (A) being a viable secondary choice. By spending more time together and facilitating meaningful interactions, the bond between Kai, his grandparents, and other family members will only strengthen, ultimately benefiting everyone involved."},{"instruction":"Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body.

When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself. You know yourself better than anyone, even if you feel like you don’t know yourself. If something feels wrong, don’t just live with it - keep pushing for a correct diagnosis!

Herod the Great built a palace fortress and a small town at Herodium, between 23 and 15 BCE, and is believed to have been buried there. Herodium is 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level, the highest peak in the Judaean Desert. Today, the site is managed by the Israel National Parks Authority. - The Second Temple was an important Jewish Holy Temple (\\"Beit HaMikdash HaSheni\\") which stood on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period, between 516 BCE and 70 CE. According to Jewish (and subsequently, Christian) tradition, it replaced Solomon's Temple (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, when Jerusalem was conquered and a portion of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken into exile in Babylon. - Antipater II ( Greek : ; c. 46 -- 4 BC ) was Herod the Great 's first - born son , his only child by his first wife Doris . He was named after his paternal grandfather Antipater the Idumaean . He and his mother were exiled after Herod divorced her between 43 BC and 40 BC to marry Mariamne I. However , he was recalled following Mariamne 's fall in 29 BC and in 13 BC Herod made him his first heir in his will . He retained this position even when Alexandros and Aristobulos ( Herod 's sons by Mariamne ) rose in the royal succession in 12 BC , and even became exclusive successor to the throne after their execution in 7 BC ( with Herod Philip I in second place ) . However , in 5 BC Antipater was brought before Publius Quinctilius Varus , then Roman governor of Syria , charged with the intended murder of his father Herod . Antipater was found guilty by Varus ; however , due to Antipater 's high rank , it was necessary for Caesar Augustus to approve of the recommended sentence of death . After the guilty verdict , Antipater 's position as exclusive successor was removed and granted to Herod Antipas . Once the sentence had approval from Augustus in 4 BC , Antipater was then executed , and Archelaus ( from the marriage with Malthace ) was made heir in his father 's will as king over Herod 's entire kingdom ( with Antipas and Philip as Tetrarchs over certain territories ) . We know two of Antipater 's wives through the writings of Josephus . First was his niece Mariamne III , daughter of Aristobulus IV. The second was a high - ranking Hasmonean princess whose first name is lost to history . She was the daughter of Antigonus the Hasmonean , the last Hasmonean king who also served as high priest . This wife of Antipater was also a first cousin of Mariamne I , renowned royal wife of Herod the Great . Josephus records that she was at the palace with Doris , Antipater 's mother , in support of her husband during his trial before Varus in 5 BC. - Aristobulus II was the Jewish High Priest and King of Judea, 66 BC to 63 BC, from the Hasmonean Dynasty. - Antipater I the Idumaean (died 43 BC) was the founder of the Herodian Dynasty and father of Herod the Great. According to Josephus, he was the son of Antipas (I) and had formerly held that name. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Judea or Judæa (from , \\"Yhuda\\", \\"Yhûh\\", , , \\"Yahudia\\") is the ancient biblical, Roman, and modern name of the mountainous southern part of Palestine. The name originates from the Hebrew, Canaanite and later neo-Babylonian and Persian name \\"Yehudah\\" or \\"Yehud\\" for the biblical Israelite tribe of Judah (Yehudah) and associated Kingdom of Judah, which the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia dates from 934 until 586 BCE. The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods as Yehud, Yehud Medinata, Hasmonean Judea, and consequently Herodian Judea and Roman Judea, respectively. - Mariamne I (died 29 BCE), also called Mariamne the Hasmonean, was a Hasmonean princess and the second wife of Herod the Great. She was known for her great beauty, as was her brother Aristobulus III. Herod's fear of his rivals, the Hasmoneans, led to him executing all of the prominent members of the family, including Mariamne. - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - Titus Flavius Josephus (37 100), born Joseph ben Matityahu (Hebrew: , \\"Yosef ben Matityahu\\"; Greek: ), was a first-century Romano-Jewish scholar, historian and hagiographer, who was born in Jerusalemthen part of Roman Judeato a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry. - The Herodian Dynasty was a Judean dynasty of Idumaean/Edomite descent. The Herodian dynasty began with Herod the Great, who assumed the throne of Judea, with Roman support, bringing down the century long Hasmonean Kingdom. His kingdom lasted until his death in 4 BCE, when it was divided between his sons as a Tetrarchy, which lasted for about 10 years. Most of those kingdoms, including Judea proper, were incorporated into Judaea Province in 6 CE, though limited Herodian kingship continued in Northern Levant until 92, when the last Herodian monarch, Agrippa II, died and Rome assumed full power over his domain. - Herod (\\"Hordos\\", Greek: , \\"Hrds\\"; 74/73 BCE 4 BCE), also known as Herod the Great and Herod I, was a Roman client king of Judea, referred to as the Herodian kingdom. The history of his legacy has polarized opinion, as he is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea, including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem (Herod's Temple), the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima, the fortress at Masada and Herodium. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE RomanJewish historian Josephus. Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus. Despite his successes, including singlehandedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing, he still garnered criticism from various historians. His reign polarizes opinion amongst scholars and historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, or a reminder of his tyrannical rule.

However, Giuseppe Bellusci failed to catch Sebastian Polter as he burst into the box and bundled over the German. Chery, who has scored six goals in his last nine outings, made no mistake from the spot. The hosts did much of the early running and the recalled Stuart Dallas, Wood and Mustapha Carayol all missed half chances. But the first half offered few clear-cut opportunities and Junior Hoilett was forced to wait until just before the break to register QPR's first effort, as his curling strike went over the bar. Steve Evans' side made a marked improvement after the break and when Luke Murphy floated the ball into the box, the visitors' keeper Alex Smithies' hesitation proved costly as Wood nipped in. After a calamitous ending to the weekend's match against Rotherham, Leeds looked to be heading for three points but Bellusci was once again at the centre of poor decision making that allowed QPR to level with three minutes to play. Both sides remain mid-table with the threat of relegation and hope of promotion having disappeared with six games remaining.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What is Kira? Movie title: Xanadu Movie plot: Sonny Malone is a talented artist who dreams of fame beyond his job, which is the non-creative task of painting larger versions of album covers for record-store window advertisements. As the film opens, Sonny is broke and on the verge of giving up his dream. Having quit his day job to try to make a living as a freelance artist, but having failed to make any money at it, Sonny returns to his old job at AirFlo Records. After some humorous run-ins with his imperious boss and nemesis, Simpson, he resumes painting record covers. At work, Sonny is told to paint an album cover for a group called The Nine Sisters. The cover features a beautiful woman in front of an art deco auditorium (the Pan-Pacific Auditorium). Earlier that day, this same woman had collided with him, kissed him, then roller-skated away. Now, Malone becomes obsessed with finding her. He finds her at the same auditorium, now abandoned. She identifies herself as Kira, but she will not tell him anything else about herself. Unbeknownst to Sonny, Kira is one of nine mysterious and beautiful women who sprang to life from a local mural in town near the beach. Walking near the beach, Sonny befriends Daniel \\"Danny\\" McGuire, a has-been big band orchestra leader turned construction mogul. Danny lost his muse in the 1940s (who is seen in a flashback scene to bear a startling resemblance to Kira), and Sonny has not yet found his muse. Kira encourages the two men to form a partnership and open a nightclub at the old auditorium from the album cover. She falls in love with Sonny, and this presents a problem because she is actually an Olympian Muse (\\"Kira's\\" real name is Terpsichore, the Muse of Dance). The other eight women from the beginning of the film are her sisters and fellow goddesses, the Muses, and the mural is actually a portal of sorts and their point of entry to Earth.

Answer:","output":"Kira is a character in the movie Xanadu, played by Olivia Newton-John. She is one of the nine Muses from Greek mythology, specifically Terpsichore, the Muse of Dance. Throughout the film, Kira serves as a source of inspiration and plays a vital role in helping the main characters, Sonny Malone, a struggling artist, and Daniel \\"Danny\\" McGuire, a has-been big band orchestra leader, achieve their dreams. The plot of Xanadu revolves around Sonny's desire to achieve success in the creative world of art and Danny's redemption as a once-successful orchestra leader. After a series of encounters and revelations about Kira's true identity, Sonny and Danny decide to open a nightclub at an old abandoned auditorium featured on an album cover that Sonny was tasked to paint for a group called The Nine Sisters. This decision opens up a path to personal and professional growth for both characters, supported by Kira's mysterious presence and guidance. Kira's love affair with Sonny, however, goes beyond the boundaries set for Muses, as they are not supposed to engage in romantic relationships with the mortals they inspire. This adds a layer of tension and conflict to the story, as Kira must come to terms with the consequences of her actions and ultimately make decisions that could affect not just her future, but also that of the budding creative partnership between Sonny and Danny. In deciding whether to invest in the film proposal, it would be crucial to consider several factors that could affect the film's potential for success. These include but are not limited to: 1. The target audience: Is the movie intended for a specific demographic or a niche market, like fans of musicals, fantasy, or Greek mythology? Or does it aim to cater to a wider mainstream audience? 2. The cast and crew: Are the actors, directors, and producers involved in the film likely to deliver a compelling final product that captures audiences' attention and satisfies their entertainment needs? 3. The budget: Does the film proposal provide a reasonable and well-thought-out budget, in line with the production needs and potential revenues from the project? 4. The storytelling and visual elements: Does the screenplay have a strong and engaging narrative structure, with well-developed characters, dramatic tension, and emotional depth? Are the visual elements of the film, such as set design and special effects, in line with current industry standards and trends? 5. The current market: What is the demand for movies like Xanadu in today's entertainment industry? Are there similar films that have succeeded or failed in the market recently, and what could be learned from their experiences? By evaluating these factors, and any other relevant considerations, you will be better prepared to make an informed decision on whether to invest in the Xanadu film proposal."},{"instruction":"Write an article with the title: \\"Reality bites Obama in Iraq\\"","output":"Title: Reality Bites Obama in Iraq Introduction: In a world where ambitions and principles collide, reality often serves as the great equalizer. For former US President Barack Obama, this statement rings true as his Middle East policy met unforeseen consequences in Iraq. The genuine desire for peace and stability in the region paradoxically led to chaos and disorder, further solidifying the harshness of realpolitik. This article will delve into Obama's administration's handling of Iraq, highlighting both its achievements and pitfalls. A Promising Start: When Obama ascended to the presidency in 2009, America was entangled in the Iraq War—an endeavor that had cost trillions of dollars and thousands of lives. The new president, voted into office on a platform of change, immediately sought to improve the situation. One of his first foreign policy decisions was the announcement of a timeline for troop withdrawal from Iraq, in line with his campaign promise to end the war. In 2011, when the last American combat troops left Iraq, Obama's supporters declared the mission accomplished, asserting that Iraq was on its path to democracy and peace. However, the optimism would soon turn out to be misguided. The Rise of ISIS: Swiftly following the US troop withdrawal, Iraq plunged into a chaotic state. The fragile political situation, worsened by sectarian rivalries and rampant corruption, created a power vacuum that birthed the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). ISIS was quick to capitalize on the fractures in Iraq's social fabric. The minority Sunni community felt marginalized and oppressed under the predominantly Shiite government, quickly becoming a fertile ground for extremist ideologies. As ISIS began seizing territory, establishing its so-called caliphate, thousands of Iraqis fled their homes in fear. Slow Pace of Intervention: In 2014, ISIS shocked the world by capturing Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, and declaring the establishment of its caliphate in the territories it controlled. The sheer speed and audacity of the group's advance put immense pressure on the Obama administration to act. However, the US response was seen as slow and insufficient by many. Restricted airstrikes and limited support to Iraqi and Kurdish forces were deemed insufficient to defeat the pervasive threat posed by ISIS. Critics argued that Obama's promise to keep American troops out of Iraq had clouded his judgment, preventing the deployment of the necessary force to defeat the terror group. Lessons Learned: The eventual collapse of ISIS' territorial control came as a result of the collective efforts of coalition partners, Iraqi forces, Kurdish militias, and the unwavering determination of the people who lived under the group's tyranny. Looking back at Obama's Middle East policy, several key takeaways emerge. 1. Unintended consequences: Obama's intent to resolve the Iraq issue peacefully was laudable, but the decision to withdraw troops from an unstable state contributed to a power vacuum that ISIS was quick to fill. Policy decisions should consider both the long-term effects and unintended outcomes. 2. Local stability and regional security: In an interconnected world, local instability can have broader implications. The impact of Iraq's descent into chaos rippled through the region, leading to destabilization in neighboring countries such as Syria. 3. Importance of inclusive governance: The neglect of the concerns of Iraq's Sunni population fostered an environment conducive to extremist ideologies. A stable society requires inclusive governance that addresses the needs and aspirations of every community. Conclusion: The path to peace is rarely straightforward. As the Obama administration discovered, untangling the intricate web of policies and legacies left by the prior administration would prove to be a Herculean task. That said, though the experience was fraught with difficulties, it provides critical insights into the complexities of international relations and the importance of long-term strategic planning—a lesson that all leaders would do well to remember."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question.

In 1923, working with Frederick Saunders, he developed RussellSaunders coupling which is also known as LS coupling. - The radial velocity of an object with respect to a given point is the rate of change of the distance between the object and the point. That is, the radial velocity is the component of the object's velocity that points in the direction of the radius connecting the object and the point. In astronomy, the point is usually taken to be the observer on Earth, so the radial velocity then denotes the speed with which the object moves away from or approaches the Earth. - Variable Star is a 2006 novel written by Spider Robinson based on the surviving seven pages of an eight-page 1955 novel outline by the late Robert A. Heinlein. The book is set in a divergent offshoot of Heinlein's Future History and contains many references to works by Heinlein and other authors. It describes the coming of age of a young musician who signs on to the crew of a starship as a way of escaping from a failed romance. Robinson posted a note on his website in 2009 noting that his agent had sold a trilogy of sequels based on the novel and its characters. - The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of its speed and direction of motion (e.g. to the north). Velocity is an important concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies. - In astronomy, the main sequence is a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appears on plots of stellar color versus brightness. These color-magnitude plots are known as HertzsprungRussell diagrams after their co-developers, Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or \\"dwarf\\" stars. - Rapidly oscillating Ap stars ( roAp stars ) are a subtype of the Ap star class that exhibit short - timescale rapid photometric or radial velocity variations . The known periods range between 5 and 23 min. They lie in the delta Scuti instability strip on the main sequence . - A Delta Scuti variable (sometimes termed dwarf cepheid) is a variable star which exhibits variations in its luminosity due to both radial and non-radial pulsations of the star's surface. The variables are important standard candles and have been used to establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, globular clusters, open clusters, and the Galactic center. The variables follow a period-luminosity relation in certain passbands like other standard candles such as Cepheids. SX Phoenicis variables are generally considered to be a subclass of Delta Scuti variables that contain old stars, and can be found in globular clusters. SX Phe variables also follow a period-luminosity relation. The recently discovered Rapidly oscillating Ap stars are also a subclass of Delta Scuti variables, found on the main sequence. One last sub-class are the pre-main sequence (PMS) Delta Scuti variables. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Ejnar Hertzsprung (8 October 1873 21 October 1967) was a Danish chemist and astronomer, born in Copenhagen, Denmark. In the period 19111913, together with Henry Norris Russell, he developed the HertzsprungRussell diagram. - The horizontal branch (HB) is a stage of stellar evolution that immediately follows the red giant branch in stars whose masses are similar to the Sun's. Horizontal-branch stars are powered by helium fusion in the core (via the triple-alpha process) and by hydrogen fusion (via the CNO cycle) in a shell surrounding the core. The onset of core helium fusion at the tip of the red giant branch causes substantial changes in stellar structure, resulting in an overall reduction in luminosity, some contraction of the stellar envelope, and the surface reaching higher temperatures. - The HertzsprungRussell diagram, abbreviated HR diagram or HRD, is a scatter graph of stars showing the relationship between the stars' absolute magnitudes or luminosities versus their stellar classifications or effective temperatures. More simply, it plots each star on a graph measuring the star's brightness against its temperature (color). It does not map any locations of stars. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - A Cepheid variable (or ) is a type of star that pulsates radially, varying in both diameter and temperature and producing changes in brightness with a well-defined stable period and amplitude. - The unqualified term instability strip usually refers to a region of the HertzsprungRussell diagram largely occupied by several related classes of pulsating variable stars: Delta Scuti variables, SX Phoenicis variables, and rapidly oscillating Ap stars (roAps) near the main sequence; RR Lyrae variables where it intersects the horizontal branch; and the Cepheid variables where it crosses the supergiants.

A:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'subclass of' with 'delta scuti variable' is Rapidly oscillating Ap stars (roAp stars)."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases? Itami-go was a part of Arioka Castle , which was ruled by Araki Murashige under Oda Nobunaga . Itami-go was a part of the castle of Arioka , which ruled Oda Nobunaga under Araki Murashige . Available choices: *no. *yes.","output":"*no. While these two sentences might seem identical at first glance, they contain significant differences that disqualify them from being considered as paraphrases of one another. First and foremost, paraphrasing involves presenting the same information or message in a different wording or structure while maintaining the original intent and essential information. For paraphrasing to be accurate, it should not alter the meaning, facts, or details of the original statement. The first sentence \\"Itami-go was a part of Arioka Castle, which was ruled by Araki Murashige under Oda Nobunaga.\\" indicates that Araki Murashige was the ruler of Arioka Castle (which includes Itami-go) under the overarching rule or authority of Oda Nobunaga. On the other hand, the second sentence \\"Itami-go was a part of the castle of Arioka, which ruled Oda Nobunaga under Araki Murashige.\\" suggests that the castle of Arioka (and therefore, Itami-go) had authority or rule over Oda Nobunaga, under the direction or power of Araki Murashige. Given these described situations are different, these sentences cannot be considered as paraphrases. The change of positions between Araki Murashige and Oda Nobunaga in the structures of these two sentences drastically alters the suggested power dynamics and relationships between the characters and places discussed. This clear variation in meaning prevents the sentences from being classified as paraphrases, because they convey different storylines and information in a historical and factual context."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: aerial footage of green forest and blue lake on a sunny cloudy day little bit windy too","output":"To identify the keywords in the given sentence, I will consider words that hold the most significant meaning or describe the core subject.

The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: By Vincent DowdArts correspondent, BBC News He was a hugely celebrated painter but before they met in 1935 she was already known in France for her photographic work. The Tate Modern exhibition sheds light on Maar's life and on her sometimes neglected work. In 1935 Maar (born Henriette Théodora Markovitch) was unit stills photographer on a film being shot at the Billancourt Studios on the outskirts of Paris. She was introduced to Picasso, 26 years her senior and already a world-famous artist. Maar became his lover and - some have thought - the most influential of his muses. For the next eight years they were part of one another's lives - although Picasso continued his existing relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter. Those few basic facts are often all that even art-lovers know about Maar, who died in 1997. Over the years there were many women in Picasso's life and she was undoubtedly one of those who mattered most to him. But Maar's reputation has been growing. A version of the Tate Modern show has already been seen at the Pompidou Centre in Paris and next year the exhibition will travel to Los Angeles. As a photographer and a painter in her own right does she deserve now to step out of his shadow? Or could what she achieved now be overstated, to compensate for decades of neglect? Professor Mary Ann Caws wrote a book about Maar 20 years ago, before her reputation had revived, and considers Maar to have been a \\"remarkable talent\\". \\"Much of her early work in France was fashion photography but it's unlike anyone else's fashion photography.... the best of her pictures are very dramatic. \\"The juxtapositions are often peculiar and so is the way she used light and dark. As soon as you know even a sample of what Dora Maar did you will always recognise her work - the pictures will speak to you. The proportions of her photographs can be peculiar but the work's always telling and has an impact. \\"Some of her photos can be shadowy and have a feeling of doom yet others can be remarkably funny. But the fashion images were only one part of Dora Maar. She went to Barcelona and took pictures of starving people in desperate circumstances. A lot of that work has been ignored because people see her in the context of knowing Picasso later.\\" Emma Lewis is co-curator of the Tate Modern show, which contains more than 250 photographic images. She says she's come to admire the \\"dark glamour\\" of Maar's work but adds \\"there's a playful element too - real subversive wit\\". Maar also photographed some of the 30,000 inhabitants of \\"la zone\\" - the circular strip of undeveloped land which became a wretched linear shantytown around Paris. The Tate Modern exhibition has striking examples of all these elements of her early career. Lewis says the 1930s were the heyday of illustrated weekly and monthly magazines. \\"It provided Dora with a means of making a living and we show how talented she was in what she did. \\"It allowed her to play with avant garde and experimental imagery. She was involved with Surrealism - but I think it was very hard for a woman to be part of that group of artists. \\"Dora Maar's commercial work appeared in big French magazines of the day such as Rester Jeune. It also circulated in various arts journals and erotic reviews. \\"By and large the documentary photography was seen in exhibitions and not in print. But her politics were left-wing and in the Depression her documentary work on the plight of the poor was important to her - she had links to the radical Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists.\\" The exhibition could hardly ignore the Picasso connection. But it puts that part of Maar's life in context. As a photographer she recorded him working on probably his best known painting - Guernica (1937). Visitors to the Tate can see some of the Picasso works influenced by Maar in their years together, including the well-known Weeping Woman (also of 1937) which the Tate already owns. Some describe this as a portrait of Maar but she always insisted she had never modelled for Picasso for any picture. But she acknowledged he used elements of her appearance. Professor Caws says Maar was the most intellectual of Picasso muses. \\"She spoke Spanish which meant they could have real conversations about the convulsive events of the 1930s. She was beautiful but I think Picasso was attracted by the dramatic spark she had.\\" The passionate relationship faded from around 1942 and Maar headed south to live in Menérbes in Provence. So had Maar accepted that no woman would ever possess Picasso? \\"I don't think she was a woman meekly to accept anything,\\" says Professor Caws. \\"When it all ended she was screaming and passionate and furious. But when she settled in the south she developed her own skills as a painter, something which used to be ignored when people wrote about her. Those paintings can be pretty remarkable but the best of the photography is incredible. \\"So we don't need to try to cut Pablo Picasso out of her life. She still has things to say to us with him or without him.\\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It is very easy to chip a nail without necessarily breaking a finger. The Choices: A). Finger is very strong. B). Nail is very strong.","output":"It is very easy to chip a nail without necessarily breaking a finger. The reason for this can be attributed to two main factors: A). The finger is very strong. 1. Bone structure: The phalanges, or finger bones, are specially designed to withstand a lot of pressure and force due to their structure. The bones are interconnected by joints that provide support and stability, making it harder for fingers to break under normal circumstances. 2. Muscles and tendons: The fingers are also equipped with muscles and tendons that surround the bones, providing additional strength and support. These work together to enable our fingers to carry out a wide range of motions and tasks, while also aiding in the absorption of impact, lessening the likelihood of a break. However, in contrast to the strength of the finger, a nail is much more susceptible to damage. B). The nail is less strong. 1. Nail structure: Nails are made up of a protein called keratin, which is also found in hair and skin. This protein makes the nail more prone to chipping and breaking, as it is more malleable and less dense when compared to bone. 2. Exposure: Nails are exposed to external elements far more than the finger bones, increasing their vulnerability to damage. Activities like typing, scratching, or accidentally knocking the nail against a hard surface may cause it to chip or crack, even if the finger remains unharmed. In conclusion, it is important to note that while fingers are quite strong and resistant to damage due to their complex bone structure, muscles, and tendons, nails are less strong and more prone to chipping as they are made of a less dense protein and are constantly in contact with external forces. So, it is common to chip a nail without breaking a finger. To maintain nail health, it is advisable to take care of your nails through regular trimming, filing, and moisturizing, as well as avoiding harsh chemicals and activities that may weaken them."},{"instruction":"This I have discovered has a major disadvantage .

Ask a question about it. Send a message regarding the item. Constantly bring it up.","output":"Title: The Art of Reclaiming Your Borrowed Possessions Introduction Lending personal belongings such as books, clothes, or electronic gadgets to friends and family is a common practice. It's a sign of trust and goodwill, and can even strengthen bonds. However, it's not unusual for these borrowed items to take an extended vacation and be forgotten in the borrower's home. No one wants to come across as rude or petty, so reclaiming your possessions can sometimes be a daunting task. In this article, we will discuss a few effective ways to be forward about asking for your belongings back without damaging relationships. 1. Be Forward about Asking for Your Belongings The first and most critical step in recovering your loaned items is to be direct and honest. Express your need for the specific item and explain its importance to you. For instance, if a friend borrowed your favorite book, you can say, \\"Hey, since I want to read that book again, could I please have it back by next week?\\" Being upfront may feel uncomfortable initially, but it shows maturity and integrity and helps to avoid misunderstandings. 2. Ask a Question about the Item When asking for your possessions back, doing so in the form of a question can be a more subtle approach. If you've lent your favorite jacket to a friend, instead of bluntly saying you want it returned, ask how they like using it or if they've had a chance to wear it. For example, \\"Hey, how did that jacket work out for you on your hiking trip?\\" Such a question prompts the borrower to think about the item and remember that it belongs to you. It is a gentle reminder that you might need it back sooner than later. 3. Send a Message Regarding the Item Sometimes, talking face-to-face can be awkward or not feasible. In those cases, sending a text message or email can be a diplomatic alternative for asking for your belongings back. A carefully composed message can convey your feelings without sounding confrontational. For example, \\"Hey, I hope you're enjoying the camera I lent you last month. But I was wondering if you were finished with it since I have a family event coming up that I'd like to use it for?\\" This not only reminds the borrower but also indicates that you have a genuine need for it, encouraging them to return it promptly. 4. Constantly Bring It Up If your previous attempts at reclaiming your borrowed possessions have been unsuccessful, you may need to be more persistent. You can bring up the topic casually during conversations or when spending time with the borrower in person. However, be careful not to seem overly aggressive or pushy. An example of this method could be mentioning an upcoming event where you will need the borrowed item, or even suggesting a get-together to exchange items you've both borrowed from one another. 5. Seek Assistance from Mutual Friends If it's getting increasingly difficult to receive your borrowed belongings, enlisting help from mutual friends could be beneficial. These friends can remind your friend on your behalf or even offer to pick up the item for you in a casual manner. It's essential to choose a close and reliable friend for this role, as you want to avoid any further complications or misunderstandings. Conclusion In conclusion, asking for your loaned items back can be a delicate situation. However, by following the above tips, you can confidently establish open communication and regain your belongings without causing a rift in your relationships. Remember to be sincere and considerate while being proactive, and always ensure the borrower understands how much you value your possessions. Maintaining healthy boundaries and honest conversations about your belongings will ultimately lead to stronger and more trustworthy connections with your friends and family."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

Movie title: Mo' Better Blues Movie plot: The film begins with a scene set in Brooklyn, New York in 1969. A group of four boys walk up to Bleek Gilliam's brownstone and ask him to come out and play baseball with them. Bleek's mother insists that he continue his trumpet lesson, to his chagrin. His father becomes concerned that Bleek will grow up to be a sissy, and a family argument ensues. In the end, Bleek continues playing his trumpet, and his friends go away. The next scene brings us to the present (over twenty years later), with an adult Bleek (Denzel Washington) performing on the trumpet at a busy nightclub with his jazz band, The Bleek Quintet (Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts, Wesley Snipes, Giancarlo Esposito and Bill Nunn). Giant (Spike Lee, one of his boyhood friends from the previous scene and current manager of Bleek's band), is waiting in the wings, and advises him to stop allowing his saxophone player Shadow Henderson (Snipes) to grandstand with long solos. The next morning Bleek wakes up with his girlfriend, Indigo Downes (Joie Lee). She leaves to go to class, while he meets his father by the Brooklyn Bridge for a game of catch, telling him that while he does like Indigo, he likes other women too and is not ready to make a commitment.

Washington (CNN) -- Since Barack Obama was first elected president in 2008, the word \\"change\\" was popular with Democrats who were seeking to win elected office. Obama effectively used it to tap into voters' disenchantment with President George W. Bush, and he ultimately swept into the White House in a watershed year for Democrats. But with the 2014 election on the horizon, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said this year's gubernatorial contests won't be about that operative word. Key gubernatorial races in 2014 \\"I am not so sure that this is the change election,\\" Shumlin said Tuesday during an editorial board meeting with CNN. The other seven Democratic seats and 13","output":"Republican-held governorships up for election this year reflect a different landscape, a contest where the issues at stake and the candidates vying for office are not so easily defined by a single mantra. In each state, voters will weigh concerns like the economy, job creation, education, healthcare, and state-specific challenges that call for more nuanced and innovative solutions. Additionally, the ideological rifts within the Republican Party continue to make headlines, as the Tea Party movement seeks to challenge establishment candidates, making it harder to predict a consistent narrative for the 2014 election. As national politics increasingly grow polarized, the need for adaptability and pragmatism on the part of gubernatorial candidates becomes imperative. Their success hinges not only on their ability to address local concerns effectively but also on their capacity to forge compromises with the legislatures they work alongside. In the race for Democratic seats, governors who are stepping down—like California's Jerry Brown, Maryland's Martin O'Malley, and Massachusetts' Deval Patrick—leave big shoes to fill, as their respective states have experienced considerable progress under their stewardships. Candidates seeking to succeed these successful governors must be prepared to continue tackling complex issues while navigating an increasingly intricate political scene. Similarly, in states where Republican governorships are up for grabs, an opportunity presents itself for GOP candidates to redefine and reshape their party's image. Some states may be battlegrounds for moderation, where centrist candidates can emerge as viable alternatives, presenting inclusive agendas that demonstrate a commitment to addressing the needs of a broader and diverse electorate. Taking Shumlin's words into account, the 2014 gubernatorial elections might not distinctly display the theme of change, but it seems that they may nonetheless offer an opportunity for both Democrats and Republicans to prove their adaptability and responsiveness to the unique demands of their constituents. Instead of focusing on a one-size-fits-all slogan, this year's gubernatorial candidates must concentrate on formulating bespoke solutions to the multifaceted challenges that confront their respective states. In a sense, the 2014 election year could be seen as a test for both parties. For the Democrats, it is an opportunity to build on the momentum created under the Obama administration, highlighting their capacity for continued socioeconomic progress while maintaining strong alliances with diverse supporters. For Republicans, it is a chance to demonstrate that they, too, can offer practical solutions that unify, rather than divide, their party and the nation at large. Ultimately, the results of the 2014 gubernatorial elections will not only shape the political landscape of various states but also have implications for the broader national political narrative, with issues such as education reform, healthcare, immigration, and climate change vying for prominence. The ability of both parties to demonstrate long-term vision, ingenuity, and adaptability will be crucial in securing electoral victories and, more importantly, delivering results for the American people."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A small dog on a leash jumps toward a pink ball.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A little dog is playing.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? A step-by-step solution is:","output":"Step 1: Identify key elements of the premise. In the premise, we have a small dog on a leash, jumping towards a pink ball. Step 2: Identify key elements of the hypothesis. In the hypothesis, we have the claim that a little dog is playing. Step 3: Compare elements from both statements. We can see a connection between the small dog in the premise and the little dog in the hypothesis. Additionally, we can associate the dog's action of jumping towards the pink ball as a form of play. Step 4: Analyze the relationship between the two statements. We can infer that the small dog jumping towards a ball is likely an action of play, which aligns with the hypothesis that the little dog is playing. However, we should also consider other possibilities that may explain the dog's actions. Step 5: Consider alternative explanations. There may be alternative explanations as to why the dog is jumping towards the ball, such as being trained to do so or reacting out of fear or aggression. However, it is more plausible that the dog is playing given the context of the situation. Step 6: Make a judgment about the hypothesis. Based on our analysis, we can say that the hypothesis - \\"A little dog is playing\\" - is likely entailed by the premise, as the dog's actions of jumping towards the ball can be considered a form of playing.

Trees and other plants can look thirsty. Leaves can become weak and hang downward. They can also turn yellow. Yellowing can be a sign of too much water. But it can also be a warning sign of too little water. With a newly planted tree, the roots have not yet spread out from the root ball. The root ball can become dry faster than the dirt around it. So put water on the area of the root ball and the surrounding soil until the roots become established. Once a tree is well established, water deeply instead of watering often. The amount of water needed depends on the tree and the soil. Clay soils hold water for longer periods while sandy soil holds less water. During the hottest season, a deep watering may satisfy a tree for anywhere from ten days to four weeks. Ted Swiecki is a plant scientist . He says people should not water established trees at the base of the trunk . This can harm the tree. Too much water in the soil at the base of a tree can lead to the growth of fungi . If the area is too wet, harmful organisms have a better chance to invade the tree and cause disease. Mr. Swiecki says this is true especially in Mediterranean and semi-dry climates. Many trees in these climates have adapted to having a dry area near their base during the hottest season. He said, \\"Water displaces (,)air in the soil.

Abstract Infection with intestinal helminths results in immunological changes that influence co-infections, and might influence fecundity by inducing immunological states affecting conception and pregnancy. We investigated associations between intestinal helminths and fertility in women, using 9 years of longitudinal data from 986 Bolivian forager-horticulturalists, experiencing natural fertility and 70% helminth prevalence. We found that different species of helminth are associated with contrasting effects on fecundity. Infection with roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) is associated with earlier first births and shortened interbirth intervals, whereas infection with hookworm is associated with delayed first pregnancy and extended interbirth intervals. Thus, helminths may have important effects on human fertility that reflect physiological and immunological consequences of infection. ||||| Infection with one of the most common parasitic worms can increase a woman's fertility , according to a new study. Scientists discovered that indigenous women living in the Amazon rainforest infested with the giant roundworm had, on average, two extra children. The nine-year study was branded \\"intriguing\\" and one that would spark much more investigation. Researchers writing in the journal Science suggest that the intestinal worm, Ascaris lumbricoides, may alter the immune system, making it easier for women to fall pregnant. The scientists, from the University of California, Santa Barbara, said parasites can trigger some of the same changes to the immune system that occur during pregnany. \\"It is very surprising and intriguing to find that infection with this particular species of roundworm actually enhances fertility.\\" Prof Allan Pacey, fertility specialist As such, they studied 986 indigenous women in Bolivia, where about 70 per cent of the Tsimane population has a parasitic worm infection. They said that the average Tsimane woman had nine children but that those infected with the Ascaris would tend to bear two more than those not infected. Ascaris, which can grow to 36 centimeters, was found to shorten the time between pregnancies and reduced the age at which women first give birth. The scientists speculated that the worms might aid conception and implantation of the embryo in the womb by reducing inflammation. • My fertility is none of your business Prof Aaron Blackwell, one of the researchers, told BBC News: \\"The effects are unexpectedly large. \\"We think the effects we see are probably due to these infections altering women's immune systems, such that they become more or less friendly towards a pregnancy.\\" He said using worms as a fertility treatment was an \\"intriguing possibility\\" but warned there was far more work to be done \\"before we would recommend anyone try this\\". Rick Maizels, a parasite immunologist from the University of Edinburgh, said: \\"This is a very original study. “I think it’s going to spark a lot of other investigations.\\" Prof Allan Pacey, a fertility scientist at the University of Sheffield, said: \\"It is very surprising and intriguing to find that infection with this particular species of roundworm actually enhances fertility.\\" The study also found that hookworms had the opposite effect on fertility, leading to three fewer children across a lifetime. ||||| Image copyright SPL Infection with a species of parasitic worm increases the fertility of women, say scientists. A study of 986 indigenous women in Bolivia indicated a lifetime of Ascaris lumbricoides, a type of roundworm, infection led to an extra two children. Researchers, writing in the journal Science, suggest the worm is altering the immune system to make it easier to become pregnant. Experts said the findings could lead to \\"novel fertility enhancing drugs\\". Nine children is the average family size for Tsimane women in Bolivia. And about 70% of the population has a parasitic worm infection.

But while Ascaris lumbricoides increased fertility in the nine-year study, hookworms had the opposite effect, leading to three fewer children across a lifetime. Prof Aaron Blackwell, one of the researchers , from the University of California Santa Barara, told the BBC News website: \\"The effects are unexpectedly large.\\" He said women's immune systems naturally changed during pregnancy so they did not reject the foetus. Prof Blackwell said: \\"We think the effects we see are probably due to these infections altering women's immune systems, such that they become more or less friendly towards a pregnancy.\\" He said using worms as a fertility treatment was an \\"intriguing possibility\\" but warned there was far more work to be done \\"before we would recommend anyone try this\\".

But Prof Maizels said parasites did the opposite, \\"growing slowly and trying to suppress the immune system\\", which is why they make vaccines less effective and lower levels of allergies. He suggested hookworm may also be causing anaemia and leading to infertility that way. 'Very surprising' Prof Allan Pacey, a fertility scientist at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC: \\"It is very surprising and intriguing to find that infection with this particular species of roundworm actually enhances fertility.\\" He said drugs had been tried to alter a woman's immune system to boost IVF, but without success. He added: \\"Whilst I wouldn't want to suggest that women try and become infected with roundworms as a way of increasing their fertility, further studies of the immunology of women who do have the parasite could ultimately lead to new and novel fertility enhancing drugs.\\" Follow James on Twitter. ||||| Women with a certain kind of parasitic worm are more likely to fall pregnant and have more children, scientists have found. A roundworm living inside women in Bolivia is now believed to cause them to mother two more children than average, the study in journal Science showed. The study of 986 indigenous women suggested a lifetime carrying the worm, called Ascaris lumbricoides, changes the immune system to make women more fertile. Professor Aaron Blackwell, one of the authors of the study and a researcher at the University of California Santa Barbara, told BBC News website the worm's effects were unexpectedly significant. \\"We think the effects we see are probably due to these infections altering women's immune systems, such that they become more or less friendly towards a pregnancy,\\" he said. He added that more research would have to be carried out before considering the \\"intriguing possibility\\" that the worm could be used to increase fertility. Another fertility scientist, Professor Allan Pacey at the University of Sheffield, said the results could lead to new drugs for women wanting to become pregnant. \\"Whilst I wouldn't want to suggest that women try and become infected with roundworms as a way of increasing their fertility, further studies of the immunology of women who do have the parasite could ultimately lead to new and novel fertility enhancing drugs,\\" he told the BBC. Another worm, the hookworm, was found in the study to lead to fewer children across a woman's lifetime - probably because this particular parasite suppresses the immune system, rather than enhances it. Professor Rick Maizels, a specialist in parasitic worms, told the BBC the effects of the hookworm on women's fertility were shocking. \\"It's horrifying that the hookworm effects are so profound, half of women by 26 or 28 have yet to fall pregnant and that's a huge effect on life,\\" he said. Women's immune systems naturally change during pregnancy, scientists have previously reported. ||||| Summary:","output":"A new study has found that parasitic worms can have contrasting effects on women's fertility. Researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, discovered that indigenous women in the Amazon rainforest who were infested with the giant roundworm had, on average, two extra children. In contrast, women with hookworm infections saw a reduction in lifetime birth rates. In total, parasitic worms infect around 2 billion people globally. The scientists believe that the varying effects are due to the balance of immune responses that the different worms induce, rather than the physiological costs of parasitism. The discovery could lead to the development of novel fertility-enhancing treatments."},{"instruction":"Dayavan: Truth is Power (English: \\"The Compassionate\\") is a 1988 Hindi thriller movie remake of the Tamil film \\"Nayagan\\" (1987). The movie was directed by Feroz Khan, and starred Vinod Khanna, Feroz Khan and Madhuri Dixit in lead roles with Aditya Pancholi in an important role. Can we infer the following? Nayagan dies not translate as The Compassionate in English.","output":"Yes, you are correct in inferring that \\"Nayagan\\" does not translate to \\"The Compassionate\\" in English. In fact, \\"Nayagan\\" in the Tamil language translates to \\"Hero\\" or \\"Leader.\\" The Hindi remake of the Tamil film \\"Nayagan\\" (1987) was titled \\"Dayavan: Truth is Power,\\" which indeed means \\"The Compassionate.\\" The titles of both the Tamil and Hindi films convey different meanings in their respective languages, with the former focusing on the protagonist's role as a leader or hero and the latter emphasizing the compassionate aspect of the character. This difference in meaning can sometimes be attributed to attempts to adapt the story or to communicate specific aspects of the film's themes to suit the intended audience or culture of the remake. In \\"Nayagan,\\" the protagonist, played by Kamal Haasan, portrays a common man's rise to a powerful underworld don in Bombay, which was later renamed Mumbai. The story is loosely based on the real-life Mumbai and Tamil don and smuggler Varadarajan Mudaliar. The film explores the duality of the character, who is initially seen as a hero but must grapple with the consequences of his actions as he grows older. Similarly, \\"Dayavan: Truth is Power\\" directed by Feroz Khan follows a parallel storyline and stars Vinod Khanna and Feroz Khan in lead roles. The movie focuses on the same themes of morality, power, and compassion, but the title explicitly indicates the protagonist's compassionate nature, perhaps intending to broaden the appeal for its Hindi-speaking audience or provide a different perspective on the character. In summary, while the titles \\"Nayagan\\" and \\"Dayavan: Truth is Power\\" have different meanings in their respective languages, both movies share the same core storyline and themes. However, it is essential to note that the title \\"Nayagan\\" does not translate to \\"The Compassionate\\" in English, as it means \\"Hero\\" or \\"Leader\\" in Tamil."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

The free end should hang behind your loop. Insert your crochet hook through the loop and hook the free end before pulling it back through the loop and onto the hook. Remember not to count your first stitch towards the 60 chains. To make one chain stitch, you'll want to hold the hook in you right hand and loop the working yarn over your left index finger. Hold the end of the slipknot between the thumb and middle finger of your left hand. Then, bring the yarn from back to front around the shaft of the hook, drawing it through the loop on the hook. Repeat this to make the first row, or foundation chain. Add 3 chains onto the 60 that you already have. This will maintain the height when you start crocheting the following rows. This will effectively count as turning your work, so just continue crocheting the row. To double chain, insert your hook into the fourth chain. Yarn over and pull the yarn through the chain. At this point, you should have three loops on your hook. Yarn over again and pull through two loops on your hook. You should now have one loop on your hook. Make sure to insert your hook into the chain and not the gap closer to your hook. To double crochet into your chain, insert your hook and yarn over. Pull up a loop, yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. Continue doing this across the length of the chain. Check to make sure you have 60 stitches once you complete the row. Turning your work simply means rotating it so that the last stitch you worked becomes the beginning of the next row. skip one stitch and double crochet 6 times into the next stitch. Repeat this all the way across. To double crochet, yarn over insert your hook under both of your loops, yarn over, and pull up. You should now have three loops on your hook. Yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. skip one stitch and single crochet into the next stitch. Repeat this all the way across. To single crochet, insert your hook from front to back in the center of the second chain from the hook. At this point, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over, or twist the yarn from front to back around the hook, and pull the yarn through the chain. Again, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and draw through the 2 loops. You'll now have single crochet stitches. Cut the working yarn, then wrap the tail around your hook and pull it completely through your loop. Wrap and roll your scalloped piece so the scalloped edges face out like petals. Make sure to keep the straight edges lined up as you roll since you'll need to secure them later. Wrapping the scalloped piece tightly will create a smaller ruffled rose, as compared to one that's looser and larger. Play with wrapping until you create a shape you like. Thread a darning or embroidery needle using the tail from your scalloped piece. Insert your needle into the next row over. Pull through to tighten the end of your scalloped piece. Using your threaded needle, continue working back and forth through the bottom or base of the row. Make sure to pass through all of the rose's layers. Keep working the thread back and forth until the rose feels secure. Trim the remaining thread and use your rose. Summary:","output":"1.

It involves various chemical reactions that break down substances to produce energy and build up other essential molecules. Several procedures can influence metabolism rates, which can help improve overall health, promote weight loss, and increase energy levels. Here is a detailed explanation of several approaches to boost metabolism: 1. Regular Exercise: Physical activity stimulates the metabolism by increasing the body's demand for energy. Engaging in both aerobic and resistance exercises, such as walking, jogging, swimming, and weight lifting, can enhance metabolic rates even when at rest. 2. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): This form of exercise involves alternating between short periods of intense physical activity and periods of recovery. HIIT has been shown to boost metabolism significantly and lead to greater calorie burning. 3. Eating Protein-rich Foods: Consuming foods high in protein can help boost metabolism since the body uses more energy to digest proteins compared to carbohydrates or fats. Incorporating lean meats, fish, eggs, nuts, and legumes into your diet can stimulate the metabolic process. 4. Drinking Green Tea: Green tea contains epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant that can increase metabolism by promoting a process called thermogenesis – the production of heat in the body. 5. Consuming Caffeine: Caffeine, found in coffee and some teas, can stimulate the central nervous system and boost metabolism in the short term. However, excessive consumption may lead to adverse effects on health. 6. Drinking Cold Water: Drinking cold water has been shown to increase metabolism temporarily since the body needs to expend energy to warm the water to body temperature. 7. Adequate Sleep: Insufficient sleep can negatively affect metabolism, making it essential to get a good night's rest to maintain a healthy metabolic rate. 8. Eating Smaller, Frequent Meals: Consuming smaller meals throughout the day can help regulate blood sugar levels and prevent overeating, both of which can contribute to a stable metabolism. 9. Spices in the Diet: Some spices, such as cayenne pepper, contain compounds that can stimulate metabolism by increasing thermogenesis. 10. Building Muscle Mass: Because muscle tissue requires more energy to maintain than fat, increasing muscle mass through strength training can lead to a higher metabolic rate. 11. Managing Stress: Stress can lead to the release of hormones like cortisol, which can negatively impact metabolism. Using stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and spending time in nature can help reduce stress and maintain a healthy metabolism. In conclusion, boosting metabolism can be achieved through various procedures involving exercise, diet adjustments, maintaining proper hydration, ensuring adequate sleep, stress management, and building muscle mass. Implementing a combination of these strategies can help improve overall health, weight management, and energy levels."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

Many colleges have similar programs. In preparation for my first year of college in 1989, I myself read Jonathan Kozol’s Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America and Nadine Gordimer’s Something Out There. I can still remember my new classmates’ passionate arguments about South Africa’s apartheid regime and chronic homelessness in New York. This summer the first-years at the college where I now teach are reading Piper Kerman’s Orange is the New Black. At least they better be. We can disagree with the authors of the books we read, but we have to read them first. It’s unclear how many of Duke’s 1,750 incoming students skipped Alison Bechdel’s highly-acclaimed 2006 graphic-novel style memoir Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic. That anyone admitted to a top university would purposely ignore their first assignment is, first and foremost, sad. These students have denied themselves a great read. The book, beautifully written and illustrated, won numerous literary awards and inspired a Broadway musical that swept the Tonys this spring. It’s a bittersweet story detailing Bechdel’s life growing up with a closeted gay father “who killed himself a few months after I came out to my parents as a lesbian.” Heavy stuff, for sure, but higher education is about examining the heavy stuff. Through her unique lens, Bechdel explores the themes of family, growing up and self-acceptance; themes we all can relate to. What’s really disappointing, however, are the reasons students have given for refusing to read the book. According to The Chronicle, they think it’s pornographic. When I heard that, I grabbed my copy off the shelf to find the porn I apparently missed the first time around. I’m not sure how one labels a book pornographic without actually reading it, of course. Maybe it’s a new twist on the Stewart test: I know it when I don’t see it? Either way, it represents the antithesis of education, which requires both the opening of books and the opening of minds. It’s true that a few panels of grey-scale drawings in the 232-page book do depict partial adult nudity and consensual sexuality. Certainly no one is exploited or objectified, making these examples far less offensive than your average love scene—both in popular culture and in classic literature. Which leads me to the conclusion that it’s not really the illustrations that have caused this most recent controversy, but rather the queer-identitifed people depicted in them. Do these students think that four panels depicting partial nudity or sex between women will make them gay or skew their sense of self? Do these students think that four panels depicting partial nudity or sex between women will make them gay? Do they think that exposure to such drawings will skew their sense of self? Or deep down do they fear that their homophobia will become hard to justify once they’ve been confronted with it in such an honest and empathetic setting. College students are adults and should be able read about sex and sexuality. They should be able to read about the lives of all kinds of people, because the reality is people identify across a wide spectrum of sexual identities. All of our stories matter. Education—especially higher education—obliges us to read, hear, and see things that we might not otherwise encounter. Anyone committed to learning must therefore engage with people, perspectives, ideas, and experiences that may at first seem strange, confusing, or problematic. Learning means we attempt to understand—it doesn’t mean we have to like everything we’re exposed to. We can disagree with the authors of the books we read, but we have to read them first. Worthwhile ideas and values can withstand exposure to other ideas and values. But those seeking a university education should be prepared to have the worldview and perspectives they developed at 18 challenged and expanded. If not, why go to college? Or read? Or think? If we aren’t being challenged, we aren’t learning. If we don’t do the work, we fail. The Duke students who refused to read Fun Home have already failed. Willfully. Perhaps Duke should dismiss them, as they’re unwilling to take on college-level study. Let them reapply when they are ready to face the danger presented by a comic book. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com. ||||| Duke Chapel on the campus of Duke University in Durham, N.C. (Jim R. Bounds/Bloomberg) As a Christian, I knew that my beliefs and identity would be challenged at a progressive university like Duke. My first challenge came well before I arrived on campus, when I learned that all first years were assigned “Fun Home,” a graphic novel by Alison Bechdel. The book includes cartoon drawings of a woman masturbating and multiple women engaging in oral sex. After researching the book’s content and reading a portion of it, I chose to opt out of the assignment. My choice had nothing to do with the ideas presented. I’m not opposed to reading memoirs written by LGBTQ individuals or stories containing suicide. I’m not even opposed to reading Freud, Marx or Darwin. I know that I’ll have to grapple with ideas I don’t agree with, even ideas that I find immoral. But in the Bible, Jesus forbids his followers from exposing themselves to anything pornographic. “But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart,” he says in Matthew 5:28-29. “If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away.” This theme is reiterated by Paul who warns, “flee from sexual immorality.” I think there is an important distinction between images and written words. If the book explored the same themes without sexual images or erotic language, I would have read it. But viewing pictures of sexual acts, regardless of the genders of the people involved, conflict with the inherent sacredness of sex. My beliefs extend to pop culture and even Renaissance art depicting sex. I’m well aware that my ethics make me an anomaly on campus, in contemporary culture and even among many professing Christians. However, my principles come primarily from my understanding of the Bible, which I have read multiple times, studied weekly in community for the last seven years, and consider to be the Word of God. I don’t believe my position will limit my exposure to essential lessons in history, philosophy or literature. I assume that having to view graphic images of sex for a class will be rare. If it does happen, I will avoid any titillating content and encourage like-minded students to do the same. And I believe professors should warn me about such material, not because I might consider them offensive or discomforting, but because I consider it immoral. Still, if my academic experience at Duke is full of thought-provoking stimuli other than pictures of sexual acts, it’s hard for me to believe that it will be incomplete. I decided to post about my decision on the Duke Class of 2019 Facebook page to comfort those with similar beliefs. I knew that my decision wouldn’t be well-received. How could it in a country where, according to one study, more than three-quarters of American men between 18 and 24 years old have viewed pornography within the past month. But though many students denounced my decision publicly, almost 20 people privately messaged me, thanking me for my post. I received many messages from Christians, but a message from a Muslim man stood out. The man, currently a sophomore at Duke, wrote, “I’ve seen a lot of people who just throw away their identity in college in the name of secularism, open-mindedness, or liberalism.” Is this really what Duke wants? Cultural pluralism will lose its value if students aren’t allowed to follow their beliefs, even if they are conservative. Without genuine diversity, intellectual dialogue and growth are stifled. I recognize, of course, that Christians on campus and throughout the country have an important responsibility, too. We need to learn how to dialogue across differences. Over the past couple of days, I have received many encouraging messages from a new friend, who considers herself bisexual and a Buddhist. She and I became friends after she saw my Facebook post. Instead of criticizing me, she asked me to explain my beliefs. I, in turn, asked her to explain the Buddhist perspective on sexuality. This is how diversity is supposed to work. We each shared our perspective, and walked away from the conversation with a deeper understanding and compassion for each other. That is what college is really about. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Many college students are assigned books to read as part of a summer reading program, and it is not uncommon for incoming students to have opinions and disagreements about the content.

How to decorate for a wine tasting party Pick a theme to create cohesiveness. To make your planning and decorating easier, try picking a particular theme. For instance, you could pick a particular region, such as wines of southern france or even wines local to your area.","output":"The most logical next event in your sequence is selecting the appropriate wine selection for your theme. However, since this is a wine tasting event, there are few more steps involved: 1. **Choosing the Wines**: The most crucial element of a wine tasting party is, of course, the wine. After you've settled on a theme, you will need to choose a variety of wines for your guests to try. If your theme is region-based, such as Southern France, you could look into the prominent wines of that area, which are typically reds like Syrah, Grenache, and Mouvedre. An assortment of both red and white wines would provide guests with a broad range of flavors and styles to assess. 2. **Determining the Order of Wines**: The order in which you serve the wines can greatly affect your guests' palate and overall tasting experience. A common principle is to serve wines from lightest to heaviest. Start with sparkling wines, then move on to light whites, full-bodied whites, rosés, light reds, full-bodied reds, and finally dessert wines. 3. **Procurement of Appropriate Glassware**: Different wine varieties often require specific types of glassware to fully unlock their aromas and flavors. While it's not compulsory to match the exact glass type for each wine, having an array of well-designed wine glasses can enhance the overall tasting experience. 4. **Preparation of Palate Cleaners**: Palate cleaners are important for a wine tasting event. They allow your guests to rinse their palates between different types of wine, ensuring that the flavor of one wine doesn’t affect the taste of the next. Common palate cleansers include bread, unsalted crackers, and mild cheese. 5. **Arranging Proper Lighting and Temperature**: Lighting can affect the guests' ability to examine the color and clarity of the wines, so setting the appropriate lighting is crucial. Similarly, temperature can have a significant impact on the bouquet and flavors of the wine. Each type of wine has its ideal serving temperature. 6. **Designing Tasting Cards**: Providing tasting cards where guests can jot down their observations about each wine's appearance, aroma, body, taste, and finish can guide them through their wine tasting journey. 7. **Planning the Décor**: This step involves actual decorating for the wine tasting. The décor should complement the theme. If you selected wines from Southern France, you might consider French-inspired decorations. Try to use appropriate tablecloths, flowers, candles, and even music to enhance the atmosphere. 8. **Setting Up a Tasting Table**: Arrange your wines on a table according to the order in which they will be tasted. Each wine bottle should have a corresponding number that matches the tasting cards. Include spittoons for guests who prefer not to swallow all the wine. 9. **Organizing Food Pairings**: Offer small food pairings to accompany each type of wine. The food should complement the wine and not overpower its taste. Remember that tasting parties are mostly about the wine, the food is secondary. After this step of organizing everything, you're ready to invite your guests and begin your wine tasting event. Remember, the ultimate goal is to create an enjoyable environment where guests can relax, learn something new about wines, and most importantly, have fun."},{"instruction":"My question: Claim: \\"Ulysses describes the name of a novel about an odyssey into the unknown seas.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?

He was called \\"The Boy Wonder\\" for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including Grand Hotel, China Seas, Camille, Mutiny on the Bounty, and The Good Earth. His films carved out an international market, \\"projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom,\\" states biographer Roland Flamini. He found work as an office secretary at Universal Pictures' New York office, and later became personal secretary to the studio's founder and president, Carl Laemmle. Among Thalberg's duties were transcribing and editing notes that Laemmle had written during screenings of his films. He earned 25 weekly, becoming adept at making insightful observations, which impressed Laemmle. Laemmle took Thalberg to see his Los Angeles production facility, where he spent a month watching how movie production worked. Before returning to New York, Laemmle told Thalberg to remain and \\"keep an eye on things for me.\\" Two months later, Laemmle returned to California, partly to see how well Thalberg was able to handle the responsibilities he was given. Thalberg gave him suggestions, which impressed Laemmle by his ability to understand and explain problems. Thalberg suggested, \\"The first thing you should do is establish a new job of studio manager and give him the responsibility of watching day-to-day operations.\\" Laemmle immediately agreed, \\"All right. You're it.\\" In shock, Thalberg replied, \\"I'm what?\\" Laemmle told him to take charge of the Los Angeles studio, which he did in early 1919. At age 20, Thalberg became responsible for immediately overseeing the nine ongoing film productions and nearly thirty scenarios then under development. In describing the rationale for this early appointment as studio manager, film historian David Thomson writes that his new job \\"owed nothing to nepotism, private wealth, or experience in the film industry.\\" He reasons that despite \\"Thalberg's youth, modest education, and frail appearance . . . it is clear that he had the charm, insight, and ability, or the appearance of it, to captivate the film world.\\" Thalberg was one among the majority of Hollywood film industry workers who migrated from the East Coast, primarily from New York.

The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney.

That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets.

Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, reached an agreement with his ranking member, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, and it's backed by 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans. The short-term deal would extend CSR payments for the next two years and would eliminate the question about whether paying them is legal. The agreement would permanently amend Obamacare to give new flexibility for states to create insurance policies that have a larger variety and lower costs and it also would continue CSRs during 2018 and 2019. \\"This is a first step,\\" Alexander said on the Senate floor. \\"Improve it, and pass it sooner rather than later.\\" Here are the co-sponsors: Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa Sen.

Al Franken, D-Minnesota Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire Alexander noted that the subsidies pay for co-pays and deductibles for low-income Americans and he noted that every Republican in the House who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare earlier this year voted for a provision in their measure that would continue CSR payments for the next two years. The GOP senator said that he and Murray are open to improving the language of their agreement and they both emphasized that they wrote it so that it requires states to make sure that the benefits of the payments go to the consumer and not insurance companies. Alexander said that the short-term deal resulted from negotiations with Murray, with whom he had already been working, when President Trump called him on Columbus Day weekend to inform him that he would cut off the CSR payments and to request that Congress put together a short-term deal to continue them. Publicly, Mr. Trump has repeatedly slammed the subsidies, claiming they enrich insurers. He complained earlier this week that the nation's biggest insurers \\"have absolutely taken advantage of this country and our people. And I stopped it by stopping the CSRs.\\" Last week he declared, \\"I don't want to make the insurance companies rich. If you look at their stock price over the last number of years — take a look at what's happened with those insurance companies — they're making a fortune by getting that kind of money.\\" Murray said that CSR payments have \\"nothing to do with politics\\" and have everything to do with whether families can \\"make ends meet.\\" After President Trump announced last week that he would end cost-sharing subsidies paid to insurers under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Republican and Democratic senators announced they had reached a deal to continue the payments for two years and allow states greater flexibility under President Obama's signature legislation. Initially, the president embraced the bill, saying at Rose Garden press conference, \\"For a period of one year, two years, we will have a very good solution.\\" He called it a \\"short-term solution, so that we don't have this very dangerous little period, including a dangerous period for insurance companies, by the way.\\" But later that day, in a speech at a conservative think tank, he qualified his earlier comments. \\"While I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray - and I do commend it - I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.\\" The White House later pointed to this remark to illustrate that Mr. Trump, in fact, opposes the Alexander-Murray plan.

York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\" A:","output":"The last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens is Etty."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A fellow speaker from California named Geri flew to Japan, in her favorite jeans and a casual jacket, to give her first speech. Fourteen hours later, four perfectly dressed Japanese gentlemen greeted her at Narita Airport. Smiling and bowing low, they handed her their business cards. With her bag in one hand, Geri took their cards with the other. She thanked them, glanced briefly at the cards, and put them into her jeans pocket quickly. When the five of them arrived at the hotel, they invited Geri to tea in the lobby . While sipping tea, the gentlemen presented her with a small gift which she eagerly opened. She was thrilled with the gift and shouted excitedly, \\"Oh, it's beautiful!\\" At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up and, bowing only very slightly, said \\"Sayonara\\" and left immediately. Poor Geri was left astonished. What did she do wrong? Everything! Her jeans were the first gaffe. Even if you're coming off a bicycle in Japan, you do not meet c1ients casually dressed. The second mistake was Geri's handling of their business cards rudely. In Japan, the business card is one of the most important communicative tools. It is always presented and accepted respectfully with both hands. However, Geri put their cards away much too quickly. In Japan, people use business cards as a conversation starter. You chat about each other's cards and work and do not put theirs away until they gently and respectfully place yours in safekeeping. Putting it carelessly into her jeans pocket was the ultimate disrespect. Then, the fourth horror of horrors was that Geri should not have opened the gift in front of her clients. In a land where saving face is critical, it would be embarrassing to discover the gift they gave was not as nice as the one they received. What is worse, Geri hadn't even given them a gift!

Today we are going to talk about a big adventure: finding a house that you can afford. Just like when you save your pocket money to buy a toy, grown-ups have to save money to buy a house. Let's learn how they do it! 1. Knowing How Much to Spend First, grown-ups need to find out how much money they can spend on a house. They do this by looking at how much money they make and what other things they need to pay for, like food, clothes, and fun activities. This helps them know how much they can save for a house. 2. Make a Savings Plan Next, they make a plan to save money. Just like you put coins in your piggy bank, grown-ups put money in a special place called a savings account. They decide how much to save each month, and they keep track of it. With a good plan, they can save enough money to buy the house they want. 3. Find a House in Your Budget Now comes the fun part! Grown-ups look for a house that is just right for their budget. This means they can pay for it without running out of money. They visit different houses and pick the one that meets their needs and is not too expensive. 4. Don't Forget Extra Costs When you buy a toy, there might be extras like batteries not included. It's the same for houses! Grown-ups also have to think about extra costs like taxes, insurance, and fixing things that might be broken. They need to make sure they can pay for these costs too. 5. Get Help from Friends Finding a house you can afford can be difficult. Grown-ups get help from friends called \\"real estate agents\\" who know a lot about houses and can help them find the right one. These friends make sure the grown-ups find a house that is safe, cozy, and fits in their budget. So little ones, that's how grown-ups find a house they can afford. Just like you, they need to be patient, save their money, and make smart choices. And when they find the perfect house, they can be happy and proud of what they have accomplished!"},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve -130*v + 1132 = -558 for v.

However a large portion of those walls remain.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"There were still walls remaining because: Step 1: Assessing the context In the given context, it appears that the city underwent various changes, including wartime destruction, modern redevelopment, and increased traffic. Despite this, many medieval walls still remain. Step 2: Identifying factors for wall survival Several factors contribute to the survival of these walls, including the fact that Georgian architecture managed to withstand the war, leaving some parts of the city intact. Step 3: Considering partial demolition From the passage, we learn that partial demolition took place specifically around the Bargate during the 1920s due to traffic congestion. The fact that demolition was only partial implies that some walls were left standing. Step 4: Weighing in preservation efforts It is also possible that preservation efforts have played a role in maintaining the remaining walls. Since the context states that extensive redevelopment took place after World War II, it can be assumed that the city may have prioritized preserving some historical structures, including the medieval walls.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor.

Between bunches of leafy greens, ripe fruits, and an assortment of small trinkets purchased as gifts for her family and friends, she soon found herself floundering, juggling all these things in her arms. Observing Patricia's struggle, Rachel, who was a good friend of Patricia's since their school years, took note of the situation and empathized with her friend's hardship. She felt the time was right to offer some assistance to ease the burden and make their walk through the market a little less cumbersome. As Rachel approached Patricia, she extended her free hand, gesturing to the reusable, eco-friendly bag she had brought along with her for occasions like this.

However, there are a few shark species that can consume a more varied diet, with some having omnivorous feeding habits. One such example is the bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo), which is a species of hammerhead shark. Recent research has shown that these sharks consume a significant amount of seagrass (a type of marine plant) alongside their diet of crustaceans and small fish. Seagrass constitutes up to 62% of the bonnethead shark's diet, which demonstrates their ability to digest and obtain nutrients from both plant and animal matter. This omnivorous diet sets them apart from their predominantly carnivorous counterparts. So, while most sharks are primarily carnivorous, there is at least one known species that can be classified as omnivorous, validating the statement to some extent. However, it is essential to remember that the bonnethead shark is an exception to the norm, and the majority of shark species remain primarily focused on consuming animal-based food sources."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice problem: Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable?

The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west.

Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers.

Their conversation is interrupted by a man (Wayne Robson) who claims that they are wrong, and that such a character does exist. The man goes on to explain that this character is a man named O.W.

It is found in Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Shaba), western Uganda, Malawi and northern Zambia. The habitat consists of woodland and open places in the forest zone. Can we draw the following conclusion? The butterfly originated in a hot climate","output":"The Platylesches lamba, also known as Neave's banded hopper, is indeed found in various countries across Africa, like Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Shaba), western Uganda, Malawi, and northern Zambia. These locations provide a variety of habitats, including woodland and open places in the forest zone. In order to draw a conclusion about the butterfly's origin, it is necessary to analyze the regions where it is found and their associated climates. Most of the countries where the Neave's banded hopper is observed have generally tropical or subtropical climates. These climates are characterized by generally hot and humid conditions, with varying rainfall patterns. The fact that the butterfly is primarily found in environments within these climate zones can be an indication of its preference for warmer habitats. The aforementioned countries are also predominantly located close to or within the equatorial region. This region is known for having a consistently warmer climate with little temperature variation throughout the year. The equator receives more direct sunlight than other parts of the Earth, which contributes to the greater heat and warmth experienced in these regions. Given the Neave's banded hopper's current distribution and the climates associated with its known habitats, it is plausible to infer that the butterfly may have originated in a hot climate. These warmer regions would have provided the necessary environmental conditions for the species to not only survive but to thrive and adapt over time. However, it is essential to note that drawing a definitive conclusion regarding the butterfly's origin based solely on its current distribution might not be completely accurate. Other factors, such as migration patterns, geological events, and incidents of human-related activities, might have influenced the butterfly's range, shifting it to its current distribution. To solidify this conclusion, further research could be done on the particular ecological preferences, reproductive patterns, genetic traits, and phylogenetic relationships of the Neave's banded hopper. Analyzing fossil records and conducting genetic studies can also shed light on the evolutionary history of the species and provide more concrete evidence to support or refute the conclusion that the butterfly originated in a hot climate."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Bionico COUNTRY Mexico; Mexico LEADER_NAME Silvano Aureoles Conejo; Bionico REGION Jalisco; Dessert DISH_VARIATION Cake; Bionico COURSE Dessert.

They also started studying Venus' atmosphere. They were fascinated by the subject and learned a lot. Team A studied Earth, team B studied planet Venus. and a hint : Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Please answer this question : Which team didn't learn about sulfur dioxide clouds? The answer is:","output":"To answer the question, let's go step by step and analyze the information provided. 1. We know that two teams of students studied Earth's atmosphere. 2. Team A studied Earth, and Team B studied Venus. 3. The hint mentions that clouds on Earth are made of water vapor, while Venus's clouds are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. Now, based on this information, we can deduce the following. Since Team A studied Earth, they learned about Earth's clouds, which are made of water vapor. They likely didn't learn about sulfur dioxide clouds, as those are found on Venus. Team B studied Venus and therefore learned about Venus's clouds, which include sulfur dioxide clouds. So, the answer is: Team A didn't learn about sulfur dioxide clouds."},{"instruction":"I've eaten here a couple of times, and the food is good.

English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of...","output":"The name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko, is M.I.A.'s son, Ikyhd."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Context: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics. There is no way of knowing whether it will last.\\" It looks as though bipartisan cooperation will not extend to health care, where Senate Republicans are making one last attempt to replace Obamacare. The effort is being led by Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy and South Carolina's... Question: after the end of the story pence Answer: A:","output":"Although the provided context has some elements that could be considered positive for President Trump, such as the increase in approval ratings, bipartisan cooperation, and his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, it is important to consider whether this upswing is temporary or indicative of a more long-term trend. As noted in the context, Trump's political approach has been unpredictable, which makes it difficult to pinpoint whether he has truly turned a political corner or if his current approval ratings will fall back to their previous lows. One reason to believe that this may be a temporary respite is the fact that Trump's history of fluctuating approval ratings has been consistent since the beginning of his presidency. Additionally, while he has achieved some bipartisan cooperation on issues such as the budget and potentially immigration, there are other key issues where this cooperation does not seem to extend, such as healthcare. The recent attempt by Senate Republicans to replace Obamacare may further highlight the difficulty of predicting Trump's political future. Also, with the characteristically unpredictable nature of his presidency, it is challenging to determine whether working with Democrats will continue to be a long-range goal for Trump or merely passing phase. Experts acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding Trump's trajectory, as mentioned by Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston, who notes that \\"there is no way of knowing whether it will last.\\" Overall, while the provided context shows a snapshot of President Trump's approval ratings with various factors contributing to the increase, it is impossible to determine whether these improvements mark a lasting trend or a temporary respite. The unpredictable nature of Trump's presidency and the possibility of unforeseen events impacting his political approach and public perception keep the future uncertain for the story after the end of it."},{"instruction":"In 2012 British MP Nadine Dorries controversially appeared on what reality TV show?","output":"In 2012, British MP Nadine Dorries raised eyebrows and ignited a controversy when she decided to appear on the reality TV show \\"I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\\". The show, which first aired in August 2002, is a British survival reality television game show produced by ITV Studios. It features celebrities living in a jungle environment for several weeks with limited resources and minimal contact with the outside world, while competing in various challenges and being subjected to public voting to win the show or ultimately face elimination. Nadine Dorries, a Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire since 2005, was the first sitting Member of Parliament to participate in the show, which led to a significant amount of debate and discussion about the appropriateness of her participation. Many of her colleagues, as well as members of the public, criticized her decision to take part in a reality TV show in place of fulfilling her parliamentary duties. The controversy was so intense that Dorries had the Conservative Party whip withdrawn upon announcing her participation in the show, rendering her effectively an Independent MP during that time. Critics of Dorries' appearance on the reality show questioned her priorities and condemned her timing, as she would not be present for important parliamentary business during her stay in the Australian jungle where the show was filmed. They also argued that her participation in such a widely-watched form of entertainment would further contribute to the public's perception of MPs being out of touch with the everyday concerns of the electorate. Meanwhile, Dorries defended her decision by stating that she aimed to reach a wider audience and engage more people in politics through her appearance on the show. Dorries was eventually eliminated from \\"I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\\" after 12 days in the jungle. Following her return to the UK, the Conservative Party whip was restored to her in May 2013. Dorries has since continued her political career, serving in different capacities within the British government. In September 2021, she was appointed as the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport. Despite the controversy surrounding her appearance on the reality show, Dorries has remained an active and vocal figure in British politics."},{"instruction":"Question: To get the printer to work, Jerry needs to add a black-and-white cartridge and three color cartridges.

Sentence 1: \\"uh-huh right and and they've changed that now now stop it go play and leave me alone yeah and so i'm using the other ones now because they're just as easy to get to and then they're nickel a gallon cheaper so\\" Upon analysis, I can understand that the speaker is referring to using \\"other ones\\" (likely an alternative) because they are just as easy to get to (equally accessible) and are cheaper by a nickel per gallon.

Born on December 14, 1812, Charles John Canning was the younger son of British statesman George Canning, who briefly served as the British Prime Minister. He pursued a diplomatic and political career and was appointed as the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Later, he was promoted to the position of Governor-General of India in 1856. The 1857 Revolt, also known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Sepoy Mutiny, broke out on May 10, 1857, in the town of Meerut in northern India. The revolt was sparked by a combination of political, economic, and social grievances among the Indian populace, particularly Indian soldiers under British command, known as sepoys. One major contributing factor was the introduction of the new Enfield P-53 rifle, which required the soldiers to bite off greased paper cartridges to load the weapon. A rumor spread that the grease was made from the fat of cows and pigs, which went against the religious beliefs of both Hindu and Muslim sepoys. The revolt rapidly spread to various parts of north and central India, with cities such as Delhi, Kanpur, and Lucknow becoming major centers of rebellion. During the course of the uprising, Lord Canning gained a reputation for his restrained and patient approach to dealing with the situation. He tried to maintain control and suppress the rebellion without resorting to excessive reprisals or punitive measures against the rebelling sepoys and the local communities. Despite facing criticism for his lenient stance, Lord Canning continued to implement policies to alleviate the grievances of Indians, thus helping to avoid future uprisings. Eventually, the revolt was quelled with the assistance of British forces and loyal Indian troops by mid-1858, leading to the dissolution of the British East India Company and the transfer of power to the British Crown. Consequently, Lord Canning's title changed from Governor-General to Viceroy of India, reflecting the new political reality."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is found in the Sound of Scalplay? , can you please find it? The Hebrides generally lack the biodiversity of mainland Britain, but like most of the larger islands, Skye still has a wide variety of species. Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote: There is plenty of land and water fowl in this isle—as hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more destructive to young cattle), black cock, heath-hen, plovers, pigeons, wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the sea abounds with fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe. The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares. They sell very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot be supposed to want beef at home. Sheep and goats are in great numbers, and they have the common domestic fowls.\\" In the modern era avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye and golden eagle.

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth.

She wanted to have an abortion but as a christian I felt that this was against my beliefs (btw I’m not pro-life, I feel like the option to abort should be there for people that don’t believe what I do but this is what I thought was right for my child). I was graduating that year and already had a pretty well-paying job lined up so I felt that I could provide for my kid. In the end me and my girlfriend came to the agreement that the baby be born but that I would be a single parent since she did not want to have a baby this young. That fall the baby was born and after that she moved back to her home state (she went out of state for college) and I got my son. At the time me and my girlfriend were 21. Fast forward two years and I just feel so tired and secluded from the world. My only friend is my son, between work and him I have no free time. All I do on my free time is go to the park with him, watch kids shows etc. My mom live kinda far away but she visits every few months and lets me have some alone time but it’s not enough. Also I basically have the same job I had when I graduated college with a slight salary increase, I have not been able to take any initiatives at work to qualify me for a promotion due to my parent responsibilities and a lot of people that started after me outrank me now. And I can’t date, like who wants a 23 year old guy with a kid. I just feel unfulfilled and alone and it has started to take it’s form in a little bit of animosity against my son and I never want that to happen.

So WIBTA for putting my son up for adoption? I would have to make sure he actually get’s adopted into a stable family like I grew up in and not into a foster home (don’t know how I would go about that though). The thing that makes me think that I am an asshole is that he has started to form an attachment to me and that it would be unfair on him to leave him and unfair on his grandmother that also has a good connection with him.

However, my recent visit to 'The Hub' has left me utterly disappointed and appalled at the abysmal quality of service, food, and ambience it had to offer. Upon my arrival, I was immediately struck by the unremarkable exterior, which paled in comparison to the promises of opulence and sophistication made on their website. Optimistically, I brushed it off as a minor oversight and entered the establishment. Navigating through The Hub was like traversing an unkept labyrinth. The dim lighting and awkward table arrangements added to the overall frustration of finding my pre-booked table. My hopes of an elegant and charming atmosphere evaporated into a cloud of overwhelming disappointment. Once we were seated, after what seemed like an eternity, our server approached us with a disturbingly unenthusiastic demeanor. As someone who values warm and congenial interactions with staff members at restaurants, this was a major letdown. The server appeared unmotivated and clearly uninterested in answering our questions about the menu. They seemed to be more invested in chatting with their fellow coworkers than in ensuring that we had a seamless dining experience. Speaking of the menu, the selection of dishes was underwhelming. The variety was sparse, with an uninspiring combination of generic appetizers and main courses that could be found in any run-of-the-mill establishment. Begrudgingly, we placed our orders and waited for our meal. When the dishes finally arrived, we were served with lukewarm, overcooked food that left much to be desired. The presentation was sloppy and uninspired. Our appetizer seemed to have been thrown hastily onto the plate, while the sauces accompanying our main courses lacked balance and depth of flavor. The portions were meager, lacking in taste and substance, and left us questioning the competence of the culinary team. To make matters worse, the ambiance only deteriorated during our meal. The noise level in the restaurant was unbearable — a cacophony of clattering dishes, boisterous conversations, and seemingly uncontrolled children running amok. It was impossible to enjoy a calm and relaxed conversation without raising our voices, making us feel as though we were dining in the heart of a beehive. Throughout the evening, The Hub teetered on the edge of chaos, its disorderliness reaching new heights when we witnessed an altercation between the staff members. The professionalism I hold in high regard was utterly absent in this unsightly scene, further detracting from an already dismal dining experience. As we requested our bill, the cherry on top was the overpriced menu. Charging exorbitant prices while delivering such lackluster food and service felt like a mockery to our decision to visit this establishment. In conclusion, the experience at 'The Hub' was an utter disappointment – a stark contrast to what its website claims to offer.

Problem:What keeps the earth orbiting the sun? Solution:","output":"The Earth is kept orbiting the Sun due to the force of gravity. The sun's massive amount of mass creates a strong gravitational field that pulls the Earth towards it. At the same time, the Earth is also moving forward, because of its velocity from when it was formed from the solar nebula. This combination of forward motion (or inertia) and inward gravity creates a balance, causing the Earth to move in a curved path or orbit around the Sun.

Choices: - cell production therapy - stem cell reduction - cell duplication - stem cell therapy A: The answer is:","output":"Stem cell therapy. Stem cell therapy is a debated therapy that offers a potential method for replacing neurons lost to injury or disease. This approach involves using stem cells, which are unique cells that can develop into multiple types of specialized cells. In the case of neuronal damage, the goal is to introduce stem cells that can then differentiate into the needed neural cells, allowing for the replacement of damaged or lost neurons. The debate surrounding stem cell therapy is due to ethical concerns, particularly in the case of embryonic stem cells (which are derived from human embryos). Some people argue that the use of these cells is morally unacceptable, whereas others believe that the potential benefits in terms of treating neurological disorders and injuries outweigh the ethical concerns. Alternative sources of stem cells – such as adult stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (which are adult cells reprogrammed to resemble embryonic stem cells) – have been identified and may help to address some of these ethical issues. Nevertheless, stem cell therapy has shown promise in preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials for treating various neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries.

When this was found out her parents got tested fur the mutation and neither of them had it, As of today she is very concerned because she would like to he children. and a hint : For autosomal dominant disorders, a person with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to their offspring. For achondroplasia, this means there will be a 50% chance that each child will have achondroplasia. Since two copies are fatal, if two people with achondroplasia have a child, there is a 25% chance of the child dying shortly after birth, a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, and a 25% chance the child will have a normal phenotype. However, in 3 out of 4 cases, people with achondroplasia are born to parents who don't have the condition. This is the result of a new mutation. New achondroplasis mutations are associated with increasing paternal age (over 35 years). Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis. More than 98% of achondroplasia is caused by a G to A point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the FGFR3 gene, which causes a glycine to arginine substitution. This makes this particular nucleotide one of the most, if not the most, mutable base in the human genome. Please answer this question : Will a baby born to parents that both have achondroplasia have a higher or lower chance of survival shortly after birth? A:","output":"A baby born to parents that both have achondroplasia will have a lower chance of survival shortly after birth compared to a baby born to a couple where only one parent or neither parent has the condition. When both parents have achondroplasia, the risk of their child inheriting two faulty genes (one from each parent) increases significantly. In this scenario, there are four possible outcomes for the offspring: 1. 25% chance of inheriting both normal genes, resulting in a child with a normal phenotype. 2. 50% chance of inheriting one normal gene and one achondroplasia gene, resulting in a child with achondroplasia. 3. 25% chance of inheriting two achondroplasia genes, which is generally fatal. When the child inherits two achondroplasia genes (homozygous state), they are at a higher risk of severe complications and death shortly after birth due to the severity of the skeletal abnormalities. This condition is known as homozygous achondroplasia or double-dominant achondroplasia. Therefore, when both parents have achondroplasia, there is a 25% chance their child will experience severe complications and a lower chance of survival shortly after birth, in comparison to children born to parents who are not both affected by the disorder."},{"instruction":"Leo: Test for natural language inference.

And no matter who you are -- a corporation selling a new widget, a senator making a political argument or just a Minnesotan sharing a funny cat video -- you have equal access to that marketplace. An e-mail from your mom comes in just as fast as a bill notification from your bank. You're reading this op-ed online; it'll load just as fast as a blog post criticizing it. That's what we mean by net neutrality. But telecommunications companies want to be able to set up a special high-speed lane just for the corporations that can pay for it. You won't know why the internet retail behemoth loads faster than the mom-and-pop shop, but after a while you may get frustrated and do all of your shopping at the faster site. Maybe the gatekeepers will discriminate based on who pays them more. Maybe they will discriminate based on whose political point of view conforms to their bottom line. We don't have to speculate. We can look to the history of the media gatekeepers for examples. Back in the 1990s, Congress rescinded rules that prevented television networks from owning their own programming. Network executives swore in congressional hearings that they wouldn't give their own programming preferred access to the airwaves. They vowed access to the airwaves would be determined only by the quality of the shows. I was working at NBC back then, and I didn't buy that line one bit. Sure enough, within a couple of years, NBC was the largest supplier of its own prime-time programming. To take advantage of this new paradigm, Disney bought ABC, Viacom (the parent company of Paramount) bought CBS and NBC merged with Universal. And since these conglomerates owned both the pipes through which Americans received information (in this case, TV networks) and the information itself (in this case, TV shows), they developed a monopoly over what you could watch. Today, if you're an independent producer, it's nearly impossible to get a show on the air unless the network owns at least a piece of it. Now Comcast, the nation's largest cable provider, and NBC/Universal want to merge. This new behemoth would be able to charge other cable carriers more for NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, Bravo and the 35 other cable networks it will own in whole or in part. This means that other carriers won't be able to afford as many choices -- and it means that your cable bill will go up. Comcast is also the nation's largest home internet service provider. And as more and more of our television is provided through the internet, other internet giants such as Verizon and AT&T will have to look toward merging with CBS/Viacom or ABC/Disney. We'll end up with a few megacorporations in control of the flow of information -- not just on TV, but now online as well. From my seat on the Judiciary Committee, I plan to do everything I can to stop these mergers or at least put rigorous restrictions on them. But if this trend toward media consolidation continues, the free and open internet will be a thing of the past unless we write the principle of net neutrality into law right now. This isn't a liberal or conservative issue. Everyone has a stake in protecting the First Amendment. And it isn't even strictly a political issue. The internet's freedom and openness has made it a hotbed for innovations that change our lives. It's been an incredible engine of job creation. The internet was developed at taxpayer expense to benefit the public interest. If we let corporations prioritize some content over others, we'll lose what makes it so valuable to our economy, our democracy and our daily lives. Net neutrality may sound like a technical issue, but it's the key to preserving the internet as we know it -- and it's the most important First Amendment issue of our time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sen. Al Franken. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of net neutrality as a fundamental aspect of free speech. It describes how net neutrality ensures that all online content has equal access in today's open internet marketplace. However, telecom companies want to establish a high-speed lane for corporations that can pay for it, creating an unequal online environment and potentially enabling these gatekeepers to discriminate based on payment or conformity to their bottom line. The author also highlights the dangers of media consolidation, which could lead to a few megacorporations controlling the flow of information on both TV and the internet, undermining the free and open nature of the internet.

Before delving into the details surrounding this event, it is essential to understand the historical context and the factors that led to this decision. When Ohio achieved statehood on March 1, 1803, Chillicothe was designated as the capital city. Chillicothe is situated about 45 miles south of Columbus and was a bustling trade center and a major hub for settlers in the early 1800s. However, due to its southern location, Chillicothe's position as the state capital did not last long. It couldn't efficiently accommodate people from all corners of the state, prompting the need for a more centralized location. In 1809, the Ohio General Assembly recognized this need, and Zanesville temporarily became the state capital between 1810 and 1812. While Zanesville offered a more centralized location compared to Chillicothe, it still did not fully meet the growing state's requirements. Due to these concerns, the Ohio legislature decided to establish a new capital that was more centrally located, easy to access, and better representative of the demographics of the entire state. Consequently, they appointed a committee of four members to scout and choose an appropriate location for the new capital. The members of the committee included Joseph Foos, James Kilbourne, John Roberts, and David Jamison. The team evaluated various sites, including Franklinton, Dublin, and others along the Scioto River. After much deliberation, the committee eventually chose a site along the eastern bank of the Scioto River, directly opposite Franklinton. This location, initially known as \\"Wolf's Ridge,\\" would eventually become present-day Columbus. The choice was primarily due to its central location, proximity to crucial waterways, and the potential for growth. State legislator David Jamison, who was part of the committee, offered legal guidance in drafting a bill to form the new capital city. The bill, known as \\"An Act establishing the Seat of Government in the State of Ohio,\\" was presented to the Ohio General Assembly on November 21, 1811. After the legislative session of 1811-1812, Governor Return Jonathan Meigs Jr. signed the bill into law on February 14, 1812, officially designating Columbus as Ohio's state capital. Columbus' naming was inspired by the renowned Italian explorer, Christopher Columbus, and the city was specifically founded to be the capital of the state. The legislators envisioned Ohio's future capital as an economically prosperous and intentionally planned city, which included residential, commercial, and public spaces. Following the legislation, architects and surveyors were appointed with the task of designing and laying out the city, considering streets, public squares, and government buildings. Over the years, Columbus has grown into a diverse and vibrant capital city, supporting its status as Ohio's state capital while continuously evolving to accommodate the needs and aspirations of its residents."},{"instruction":"PM backs violent game inquiry Tony Blair said children need protecting from violent video games, blamed for the murder of a schoolboy.

Question: What features do some flightless birds have that make them similar to birds that can fly? Context: Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.

A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

Possible A: fast food restaurant, plate, bowl, freezer, oven Why is \\"fast food restaurant\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Fast food restaurant\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it accurately describes the context, nature, and purpose of KFC as an establishment. KFC, which stands for Kentucky Fried Chicken, is a well-known chain of fast-food restaurants that specializes in serving various types of chicken dishes. Let's examine the other possible answers and why they don't align with human common sense in the context of the question: 1. Plate: A plate is a flat, typically round or oval dish that is used to hold or serve food. While KFC may serve its chicken on plates, the question is asking about the nature of KFC as a whole and not about the specific item that holds the food. Additionally, a plate does not serve chicken, but rather it is used for serving food in general. 2. Bowl: A bowl is a deep, round dish with a wide top and a narrower bottom, used for holding and serving food. Similar to the plate, a bowl is not an accurate representation of KFC's nature and purpose. While some dishes at KFC may be served in bowls, the question is asking about the overall concept of KFC, which is not limited to the vessel in which the chicken is served. 3. Freezer: A freezer is an appliance or compartment that is used for preserving food at very low temperatures, typically below freezing. While KFC may use freezers to store some ingredients, it is not primarily known for using freezers. The main focus of the question is the identity of KFC as an entity that serves chicken, and the freezer is merely a small aspect in the food preparation process. It does not capture the broader context of KFC as a fast-food restaurant. 4. Oven: An oven is a kitchen appliance or device that is used for cooking food by applying radiant heat. While ovens may be used at KFC for cooking certain dishes, they are not synonymous with KFC as an overall establishment. The question aims to describe KFC in terms of its core function as a place that serves chicken and not to focus on the specific cooking method employed. In conclusion, \\"fast food restaurant\\" aligns well with human common sense because it encapsulates the purpose and function of KFC as a place where people can quickly purchase and consume a variety of chicken dishes.

Many people insist that ideas about right and wrong are merely personal opinions. Some voices, though, are calling Americans back to traditional moral values. William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they? One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, \\"I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe.\\" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth. Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people. But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best policy.\\" Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up. Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need. In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans. Responsibility, loyalty, courage, gratitude and many others could be discussed. In fact, Bennett's bestseller-over 800 pages-highlights just 10 virtues.

The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired and bicker, but Grug doesn't listen. Guess a valid title for it!

Answer: The subject matter had previously been generally religious and/or monarchical, featuring essays, poetry, and painting. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: Before delving into the specific subject matter focused on by the concours academiques prior to 1725, it is essential to briefly understand the context and purpose of these competitions. The concours academiques, also known as academic competitions or \\"prix de Rome\\" in France, were organized by artistic and learning institutions such as the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) and the Académie de France à Rome (French Academy in Rome). These competitions aimed at promoting art and learning among the young artists and scholars by providing them with opportunities to display their talents, and winners often received prestigious scholarships or commissions. During the period prior to 1725, the subject matter focused on by the concours academiques was primarily influenced by the sociopolitical context in France at that time. Under the reign of Louis XIV and earlier monarchs, France was a predominantly Catholic country with a strong emphasis on religious and monarchical themes in art, literature, and scholarship. As such, the subject matter emphasized in academic competitions often reflected these values, featuring topics that centered around the lives of saints, biblical narratives, historical events related to the monarchy, and allegorical scenes representing virtues and ideals upheld by the ruling political and religious institutions. Several categories of artistic and intellectual disciplines were represented in the concours academiques during this period. These included: 1. Painting: Competitions in this category often involved participants creating artworks depicting religious or historical scenes, with emphasis on accurately portraying the human form and conveying emotions and drama through composition, color, and the use of light. 2. Sculpture: Similar to painting, the sculpture competitions primarily featured biblical and mythological subjects, as well as notable figures from the monarchy. Participants were expected to demonstrate their mastery of form, anatomy, and the ability to convey emotions and movement through their work. 3. Architecture: Participants in architectural competitions typically designed buildings, monuments, and urban planning projects that aligned with the grand, symmetrical, and highly decorative style favored by the French monarchy at the time. This style, often known as the French Classicism, was characterized by practicality, efficiency, and harmony in its design principles. 4. Music: Composers and musicians participated in concours academiques by presenting original works, many of which were sacred or secular compositions written for the Catholic Church or the royal court. These compositions adhered to the formal and stylistic conventions of Baroque music, favoring intricacy, ornamentation, and elaborate counterpoint. 5. Literature, poetry, and philosophy: Participants in these categories were often asked to write essays, plays, and poems on themes relating to the lives of saints, historical events involving French monarchs, and moral and philosophical issues relevant to the reigning ideology. They were expected to demonstrate erudition, eloquence, and a deep understanding of the classical literary and philosophical traditions, which were highly valued during this period. In conclusion, prior to 1725, the subject matter focused on by the concours academiques reflected the religious, political, and artistic ideals of the time. They served as a platform for young artists and scholars to demonstrate their mastery of these ideals and, in turn, contributed to the perpetuation of the cultural values that were an integral part of French society during this era."},{"instruction":"Article:Billed as a 24-hour stint in the lift, in reality the Transformers star is actually allowed out to answer the call of nature.

Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it. Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan's parents. As the MacKenzies are on a cruise in the Caribbean, the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to the chagrin of George, who is still obviously paranoid from a previous mishap with them.

It depends. Last Friday, Republicans in Massachusetts questioned the racial ancestry of Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Senate candidate. Her opponent, Senator Scott Brown, has accused her of using minority status as an American Indian to advance her career as a law professor at Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Texas. The Brown campaign calls her ties to the Cherokee and Delaware nations a “hypocritical sham.” In a press conference on Wednesday, Warren defended herself, saying, “Native American has been a part of my story, I guess since the day I was born, I don’t know any other way to describe it.” Despite her personal belief in her origins, her opponents have seized this moment in an unnecessary fire drill that guarantees media attention and forestalls real debate. This tactic is straight from the Republican cookbook of fake controversy. First, you need a rarefied elected office typically occupied by a certain breed of privileged men. Both the Presidency and the Senate fit this bill. Second, add a bit of interracial intrigue. It could be Kenyan economists eloping with Midwestern anthropologists, or white frontiersmen pairing with indigenous women. Third, throw in some suspicion about their qualifications and ambitions. Last but not least, demand documentation of ancestry and be dissatisfied upon its receipt. Voila! You have a genuine birther movement. The Republican approach to race is to feign that it is irrelevant — until it becomes politically advantageous to bring it up. Birthers question Obama’s state of origin (and implicitly his multiracial heritage) in efforts to disqualify him from the presidency. They characterize him as “other.” For Warren, Massachusetts Republicans place doubts on her racial claims to portray her as an opportunistic academic seeking special treatment. In both birther camps, opponents look to ancestral origins as the smoking gun, and ride the ambiguity for the duration. Proving Native American ancestry is a complex, bureaucratic process. It’s more than showing up at the tribal enrollment office with a family bible and some black and white pictures. Many people are rejected, even when family lore tells them otherwise. Tribal citizenship depends on descent from an enrolled ancestor, and every tribe has its own requirements. In the Cherokee Nation, there is no minimum blood requirement, which would allow someone with as little as 1/128 Cherokee blood to enroll (that would be a great-great-great-great-great grandparent). Finding that remote relative is not conclusive, however. The ancestor may not have enrolled himself. Or he could have favored assimilation and counted himself as white. Or her application was rejected or she became ineligible for citizenship. Like Elizabeth Warren, I am a law professor who was born in Oklahoma. I am enrolled as a member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, which, along with the Cherokee Nation, has recently experienced great strife in defining what it means to be Native. In the past year, the arguments have escalated nationwide. Some members say that tribes should be composed only of members with high degrees of Indian blood. Others say it should be geographically based. And some others say citizenship should be based on history and culture, regardless of blood or residence. In my personal opinion, it’s whether you have a fry bread chef-lady as a relative. (In my family, I’m that “lady.”) Even within Indian Country, the meaning of race and citizenship is contested. And now the Brown campaign wants to dictate Warren’s own belief in her identity. According to the Brown campaign, Warren could not be Indian because she is blonde, rich and most of all, a Harvard law professor. Her 1/32 Cherokee ancestry, sufficient for tribal citizenship, is not enough for the Republican party. To most people, she appears as white as, well, Betty White, but to the Scott Brown campaign, she is just Dancing With Wolves. The Brown campaign asserts that Warren knowingly classified herself as Native American in the 1990s when Harvard weathered sharp criticism for its lack of faculty diversity. During this time, they argue, Warren relied upon this classification to enhance her employment opportunities and to improve Harvard’s numbers. Her faculty mentors at Harvard deny this and assert that the law school hired Warren without any knowledge of her ancestry. Admittedly, news of Elizabeth Warren’s Cherokee and Delaware ancestry comes as a surprise. There simply are not enough places in legal academia for Native American professors to hide. The community is tight and small. It’s like “Peyton Place,” but with academic arguments over subject matter jurisdiction. According to the Association of American Law Schools, Native law professors are only .5% of all law faculty — about fifty people out of 11,000. Native faculty are familiar with “box checkers”: those students and faculty who become Native for the temporary moment of admissions or employment. As soon as the application is mailed or the interview completed, the candidate returns to life as usual. The Cherokee Princess Grandmother served her purpose, and her memory is revived at convenient times. This merits a reexamination of the difficult question of what it means to be Native. Does that make the Chickasaw kid from Buckhead in Atlanta any less Native than the Navajo faculty candidate from Windy Gap? What does a Native even look like? It’s more than long black hair, feathers and beads. At the same time, it is more than checking a box. Someone’s subjective opinion about her heritage may conflict with tribal requirements for membership. The standards are not constant, and they may change with new tribal governments. This happened in my tribe in 2002, when the new chief decided that some members were not “Indian enough.” Even at home, the tribal government falls into stereotypes. For the Cherokee Nation, Warren is “Indian enough”; she has the same blood quantum as Cherokee Nation Chief Bill John Baker. For non-Natives, this may be surprising. They expect to see “high cheekbones,” as Warren described her grandfather as having, or tan skin. They want to know of pow wows, dusty reservations, sweat lodges, peyote and cheap cigarettes. When outsiders look at these ostensibly white people as members of Native America, they don’t see minorities. As a result, Warren feels she must satisfy these new birthers and justify her existence. Looked at from the inside, however, the Warren controversy is all new. When the Brown campaign accused Elizabeth Warren of touting herself as American Indian to advance her career, this was news to Native law professors. We have a good eye for welcoming faculty to the community and identifying promising scholars. We know where people teach, what they have published and we honor them when they die. Harvard Law School named its first Native American tenured professor? Really? In our small indigenous faculty town, we would have heard about it already. Kevin Noble Maillard is a law professor at Syracuse University and a member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. He is the co-editor of “Loving v. Virginia in a Post Racial World: Rethinking Race, Sex, and Marriage,” which will be published later this month. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses a controversy about Elizabeth Warren, an American politician, who claims to have Native American ancestry. Some people, especially her political opponents, questioned this claim. They suggested that she might be using her alleged Native American status to gain advantages in her career. Warren defended her claim, saying Native American heritage is part of her family story. But this situation has sparked a larger debate about what it means to be Native American. Some people think you must have a certain amount of Native American 'blood', while others believe it’s about being related to certain families or living in certain places.

However, it can be expanded upon to provide more details for a fuller understanding of the topic. These small groups, also known as independent churches, house churches, or non-denominational churches, often emerge as a result of the vision and passion of a single pastor or a group of like-minded individuals who want to create a faith community focused on specific teachings, particular interpretations of the Bible, or unique worship styles. As a result, they have little direct affiliation with historical denominations such as Catholicism, Anglicanism, or Presbyterianism, among many others. This separation from established denominations is often intentional, as it allows these small groups to develop their own religious practices and beliefs without the hierarchical restrictions and traditional doctrines that may be present in more established religious institutions. However, it is important to note that while these smaller groups might not have a strong affiliation with historical denominations, they might still share some common beliefs, values, and practices with them. This is because many founders of such groups or congregations come from various religious backgrounds, and the beliefs they hold and teach in their communities might be influenced by these previous affiliations. In some cases, members of these small groups might still identify with a specific historical denomination but prefer to worship in a more intimate, close-knit setting that the smaller group provides. It is also worth mentioning that these small groups can still form connections with other independent churches or even with some historical denominations, albeit without direct affiliation. This can happen through networks, alliances, or associations that provide opportunities for sharing resources, expertise, and support in the areas of mission, education, youth and community programs, etc. Additionally, these relationships can open up the possibility of promoting theological exchange and dialogue, fostering mutual understanding and acceptance despite the differences in beliefs and practices. In conclusion, while these small groups generally have little affiliation with historical denominations, it is important to recognize the complex and varied nature of their relationships with such established religious institutions. This can range from sharing certain beliefs and values to loosely collaborating in broader networks for mutual support and growth. The key distinction lies in their independence and flexibility to develop their own religious practices and identities separate from the constraints of traditional hierarchical structures."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What coffin did the group first find? Title: Buried Movie plot: On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in Iraq, wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land. - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. - Eogyrinus attheyi ( from Greek eos , meaning \`\` dawn '' , and gyrinos , meaning \`\` tadpole '' ) was one of the largest Carboniferous tetrapods , and perhaps one of the largest of its family , Eogyrinidae , at 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) in length . Eogyrinus appears to have been a powerful swimmer that moved quickly through the water by swishing its long tail from side to side . It may have been a predator , lying in wait for prey in much the same way as a modern crocodile . It was a lightly built animal , weighing around 560 kilograms ( 1,230 lb ) . Although probably better at hunting in the water , Eogyrinus could probably have also made a grab for prey passing close by on land . Fossils of Eogyrinus are known from northern England . Recent studies by Jennifer A. Clack suggest that the amphibian Pholiderpeton described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 is the same animal as Eogyrinus . If this is so , then Pholiderpeton 's name takes priority . - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Eogyrinidae is an extinct family of large, long-bodied tetrapods that lived in the rivers of the Late Carboniferous period.

He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. When Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, \\"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\\", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994. In 1980, while on the set of the film Caveman, Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has eight grandchildren - one from Zak, four from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather. Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2011, Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of PS150 million. In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014 Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles. In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles. Highlights of the collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan; and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered \\"0000001\\". The auction raised over 9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach. In 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, explaining: \\"I thought the European Union was a great idea, but I didn't see it going anywhere lately.\\" In 2017 he described his impatience for Britain to \\"get on with\\" Brexit, declaring that \\"to be in control of your country is a good move.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"Okay, so Ringo Starr is a famous musician. He played the drums for a band called The Beatles. They were very popular all over the world. Sometimes he also sang songs for the Beatles like \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\". He had a tough time when he was a little kid because he was very sick and had to stay in the hospital a lot. This made it hard for him to keep up with school. Ringo Starr got married two times. His first wife was a lady named Maureen and they had three children together, named Zak, Jason, and Lee. But they ended up getting divorced because Ringo Starr wasn't always faithful to Maureen. Sadly, Maureen later passed away from a sickness called leukaemia. He later met a lady named Barbara Bach when he was filming a movie and they got married. They spend their time in different homes in Surrey, Los Angeles, and Monte Carlo. Ringo Starr and Barbara also like to give away some of their things to people who want to buy them, sometimes, and they use the money they get to help a charity they started. In recent years, Ringo Starr said that he thought it was a good idea for the UK to be in charge of its own rules and laws and wanted it to happen faster."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: who was ryan dressed as on the office?","output":"To find out who Ryan was dressed as on The Office, I will perform the following steps: 1.

Today, we're going on an adventure into the land of shapes, colors, and lines. Our magical tool for the day is the y=mx+b formula. Now you may be wondering, \\"What on earth is the y=mx+b formula?\\" Well, it's a magical way to help us draw straight lines. Remember when you played with your crayons and tried to draw a straight line? Sometimes it was tricky, right? But, with the help of the y=mx+b formula, we can draw beautiful straight lines every time. Let's learn how to use this amazing tool. Step 1: Understand what the formula means. The y=mx+b formula looks like a funny little code, doesn't it? But don't worry, it's not that hard. Let's break it down into smaller pieces. - y and x are like two friends who help us to find a cool spot on the paper to draw the line. - m is like a slide that tells us how steep the line we're going to draw should be. - b is our special buddy who shows us where to start drawing our line on the paper. Step 2: Find your line's y-intercept (b). The y-intercept (b) is where your line will cross the vertical line on your graph paper called the y-axis. It's your starting point for drawing the line. So we first need to find that spot (the y-intercept). Your teacher or parent might give you the number for 'b', or you'll find it in a math problem. Step 3: Find the slope (m). Next, we'll need to know the slope (m). This number tells us how steep the line is going to be, like how steep a slide is at the playground. If the slope is a big number, the line will be super steep, and if it's a small number, it will be more like a gentle hill. Your teacher or parent might give you this number too, or you'll find it in your math problem. Step 4: Draw your graph. Now, it's time for the fun part - drawing! Grab your graph paper, some colored pencils, or crayons. Start by drawing two perpendicular lines called the x-axis (horizontal line) and the y-axis (vertical line). These lines are like roads that help us find the perfect spot to draw our line. Step 5: Draw your line. Here comes the exciting part! First, find the y-intercept (b) on the y-axis – this is where our line will begin. Then, use the slope (m) to guide you as you draw the line. You'll need to go up or down the y-axis as directed by the slope, and then move to the left or right on the x-axis. It's like a fun dance move! And ta-da! You've now drawn a beautiful straight line using the y=mx+b formula. You're like an artist and a math wizard all at once! Now that you know how to use the magical y=mx+b formula, you can draw straight lines with ease, impress your friends, and make your drawings and graphs look amazing!"},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to count the number of nouns/verbs in the given sentence.

Step 2: Examine Chris Christie's size Chris Christie is known to have struggled with his weight throughout his political career. However, we need to compare his size to other heavyweight politicians to verify if he is the heftiest politician ever. Step 3: Identify other heavyweight politicians in history There are notable politicians in history who were also quite large, including: - William Howard Taft (27th President of the United States) - According to historical records, Taft weighed around 340 pounds (154 kg) at his heaviest. - Cyril Smith (British Member of Parliament) - He reportedly weighed around 400 pounds (180 kg) during his lifetime. - Rob Ford (former Mayor of Toronto, Canada) - Ford admitted to weighing 330 pounds (150 kg) during his tenure as mayor. Step 4: Compare these politicians to Chris Christie To determine if Christie is the heftiest politician ever, it's necessary to compare his size to those of other heavyweight politicians mentioned in Step 3. At his heaviest, Chris Christie's weight was reported to be around 322 pounds (146 kg) before undergoing gastric band surgery in 2013 to help him lose weight. Step 5: Arrive at the conclusion Considering the information from Steps 1-4, Chris Christie, even at his heaviest, was not the heftiest politician ever. William Howard Taft, Cyril Smith, and Rob Ford were all among those who outweighed Chris Christie at various points in their careers. Therefore, the answer to the question is \\"no.\\" Chris Christie was not the heftiest politician ever."},{"instruction":"Golfe dAlaska Which language is this?","output":"This phrase, \\"Golfe dAlaska,\\" is written in French.

We debated the merits of clinical benchmarks that payers and regulatory groups now require, crude proxies of quality care like giving antibiotics at certain times, ordering specific tests at set intervals or permitting our results to be reported publicly. One colleague, a devoted and highly respected clinician in his department, admitted that he found this growing list of directives from others exasperating. “I’m all for taking great care of patients,” he said, the muscles along his jaw tightening. “But how can some insurance bureaucrat or policy wonk who’s not in the clinical trenches know more about taking good care of real patients than someone like me?” Since 1999, when a national panel of experts released a landmark report on the high number of medical errors, insurers, policy makers and regulatory groups have been piling onto the quality-improvement wagon with ever increasing gusto. As a result of their enthusiastic efforts, hospital accreditation procedures and standards have become more rigorous, physician duty hours have been trimmed, hand-sanitizing gel dispensers in hospitals have multiplied and physician reimbursement has been linked increasingly with quality goals and less with the number of CT scans ordered. But few of these quality enthusiasts are actually caring for patients. And when a study in The New England Journal of Medicine last fall reported that despite all the efforts and new financial incentives, there was no significant decrease in patient injuries, these same enthusiasts were quick to point to the inertia and intractable attitudes of the medical “culture.” They noted that less than 2 percent of hospitals had installed comprehensive electronic medical records systems, doctors and nurses were routinely working in excess of limits on duty hours and few were paying attention to even simple hand-washing recommendations. It would take nothing short of an all-out legislative, financial and regulatory assault to change the system, many of them concluded. But what these “experts” failed to take into account was the same thing that has led to the downfall of countless other groups’ efforts to create sustainable change: They ignored the contributions of the people within the system. There have been a handful of grassroots endeavors, but most have focused on specific clinical dilemmas. Now that may be changing. Last week, nearly 1,000 surgeons, nurses and hospital administrators from across the country convened in Boston to discuss what is quickly becoming one of the most far-reaching of such efforts, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from the American College of Surgeons, the largest professional organization of surgeons. With the average American undergoing nine operations in his or her lifetime, the implications of a program that can improve how patients do after surgery are enormous. Based on an initiative in the 1990s that sharply decreased surgical complication rates in the Veterans Health Administration, the program was offered to all hospitals beginning in 2004 and is now used by surgeons at more than 400 institutions. Unlike most other quality programs, which gather data from insurance claims and coding data, it relies on information from patients’ hospital charts and follows patients for 30 days. A detailed analysis, along with statistics comparing results with those of all other participating hospitals, is then sent back to participating hospitals. “When you feed back data that clinicians can believe and tell them that there is room to improve, most will work to get better,” said Dr. Clifford Y. Ko, who has directed the program for the last five years. Surgeons and hospitals that discover, for example, that their rate of wound infections after surgery is higher than other participating hospitals have convened forums to discuss the issue, established electronic checklists to remind staff to administer timely prophylactic antibiotics and instituted mandatory training courses to improve how doctors and nurses care for patients’ incision sites before, during and after an operation. The efforts pay off. Within two years of adopting the program, almost 70 percent of hospitals decrease their mortality rates, and over 80 percent decrease their complication rates. Costs also decrease. Surgeons at Baptist Hospital in Miami, for example, reduced their rate of surgical incision infections to less than 2 percent from 4.5 percent and saved 4 million each year. Surgeons at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit ended up saving their institution 2 million annually by decreasing their patients’ average hospital stays by almost two days. “If a surgeon is doing several hundred operations a year and the department is doing several thousand, it’s difficult to keep track of all the urinary tract infections that patients might be having,” said Dr. Fabrizio Michelassi, surgeon in chief at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, which has been a part of the surgical improvement program for several years. “NSQIP has the power to let us examine complications and outcomes on a large scale, drill down and make systemwide changes, then see their effects.” The program has also slowly transformed the traditional hierarchy of surgery. Nurses are crucial members of the surgical quality improvement team at each site, and employees from administration, pharmacy and central processing and sterilization are sometimes included on review teams. “There isn’t anyone who isn’t a part of this process,” said Jennifer Ritz, a nurse who has helped to run NSQIP at Henry Ford Hospital since 2006. But not all hospitals have adopted the program. Many are already overwhelmed with the administrative demands of existing quality improvement programs, and the cost — a yearly fee of 10,000 to 24,000, plus the training and support of at least one full-time nurse — can be prohibitive. There’s also no immediate return on investment. “If you buy some high-tech surgical robot, more patients and surgeons are going to come to your hospital,” said Dr. Dennis Begos, chairman of surgery at Winchester Hospital, a 250-bed community hospital north of Boston that participates in the program. The American College of Surgeons hopes eventually to collaborate with regulatory and federal agencies so that more hospitals, and patients, might be able to benefit. And it’s working with participating hospitals to further refine the program. “We all know that it’s hard to move the quality improvement dial,” Dr. Ko said. “But NSQIP has shown us that it is really possible to change care and give our patients better outcomes. “And that quality improvement is local.” What was this article about?","output":"The article discusses the challenges in improving health care quality and patient safety, specifically focusing on the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) from the American College of Surgeons. It highlights how traditional approaches and benchmarks have often ignored the contributions of the people working within the healthcare system. NSQIP, an initiative dating to the 1990s, works to collect data from patients' hospital charts and follow them for 30 days, aiming to improve post-surgery patient outcomes. The article mentions the successes of hospitals that have adopted NSQIP, such as reduced mortality rates, decreased complication rates, and cost savings. It also addresses barriers to adoption, such as administrative demands and costs, and the hope of collaborating with regulatory and federal agencies for wider implementation. The NSQIP exemplifies a grassroots approach to quality improvement that involves various stakeholders within the healthcare system working together to improve patient outcomes."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

Article: Don Ritchie, a famous Australian man. For nearly 50 years, he successfully stopped 160 people from killing themselves at a cliff called 'the Gap' - with just a kind word and a smile. Ritchie had served in the Royal Australian Navy during World War II. In 1964, he moved into a house on Old South Head Road. He began saving strangers soon after. Ritchie was a real gentleman who purposely chose to live right across the street from 'the Gap', just because he wanted to continue saving lives. He would wake up every morning and look out of the window for anyone standing too close to the edge of the cliff. If he saw someone and thought they might jump, he would simply walk over with a smile and say, \\"Is there something I could do to help you?\\" That sounds very simple, but it worked - Ritchie tried to have a talk with these people and ended up inviting them back to his house for tea or breakfast. In 2006, Ritchie was given the Medal of the Order of Australia for all his saving lives. In 2010, he and his wife were named Woollahra Council's citizens of the year and in 2011, he was given the Local Hero Award for Australia by the National Australia Day Council.

The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art. contains an answer for the question: What are the names of the five Middle French prose works?, what is it ?

While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.
