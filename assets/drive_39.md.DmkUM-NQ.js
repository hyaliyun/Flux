SANTIAGO (AFP) - Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, 89, was indicted and placed under house arrest and may, for the first time, face trial for murders and kidnappings of opponents to his 17-year rule. Choices: A). World B). Sports C). Business D). Science/Tech","output":"This news is about A). World, particularly focusing on politics and human rights in Chile during the rule of former dictator Augusto Pinochet. The article discusses his indictment and house arrest for murders and kidnappings of those who opposed his 17-year rule. This is an important development considering the impact Pinochet's regime had on Chilean society and the many victims who continue to seek justice. Augusto Pinochet, born on November 25, 1915, was the leader of Chile from 1973 to 1990. He came to power through a coup d'état on September 11, 1973, overthrowing the then-elected socialist president Salvador Allende. Pinochet's regime was known for its brutal oppression of dissidents, severe human rights abuses, and widespread corruption. An estimated 3,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were imprisoned and tortured during his rule. Pinochet stepped down in 1990, but he continued to influence Chilean politics for years after, serving as a senator-for-life. Several attempts were made to prosecute him, both in Chile and abroad, for human rights violations committed during his rule. In October 1998, Pinochet was arrested while visiting London, following a request from a Spanish judge who wanted to try him for human rights abuses committed against Spanish citizens in Chile. This marked a significant milestone in efforts to hold him accountable for his regime's crimes and demonstrated the concept of universal jurisdiction, which allows for the prosecution of war criminals and those responsible for crimes against humanity anywhere in the world. However, due to health concerns, Pinochet was returned to Chile in 2000 without standing trial. The indictment in the news refers to charges brought against Pinochet in Chile, where he faced house arrest and the possibility of domestic legal proceedings for the first time. Pinochet was charged with multiple counts of human rights abuses, including murder and kidnapping, stemming from his role as the dictator responsible for implementing repressive policies and practices which led to the suffering and deaths of thousands of Chileans. Despite these legal efforts, Pinochet never faced a full trial for his crimes, as his health significantly declined, and he later died on December 10, 2006. His death left behind a legacy of pain and trauma in Chile, with many families still searching for the truth about their missing loved ones and hoping for justice for the atrocities committed during his rule. In conclusion, the news about Augusto Pinochet's indictment and house arrest is related to world affairs, specifically the political history of Chile and the pursuit of justice for human rights abuses committed during his dictatorship. The case highlights the struggle for accountability in cases of severe human rights violations and demonstrates the importance of continuing to seek justice for victims, even decades after the crimes have been committed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this article and answer this question The Panthers came into the Monday night game as one of four undefeated teams in the NFL, while playing their second game in eight days. The team took to the field amid fireworks, as is their custom for prime-time contests. A heavy rain kept up most of the night, which saw both the drenched crowd of over 74,000 stay in their seats and a 23-6 Panther lead dissolve by a 17-point Colts comeback in the 4th. Indianapolis sent the game into overtime with a field goal following a near-pick by Kuechly; the extra period began close to midnight. Each team managed a field goal on their first two possessions. Carolina got a break when Colts QB Andrew Luck threw his third interception, which was picked off by Kuechly on the game's 154th play, according to ESPN play-by-play man Mike Tirico. A few plays later, Panthers kicker Graham Gano hit a 52-yard field goal, his longest of the season, to give Carolina the win early Tuesday morning.

Write a summary based on this article: One week ago I left Hong Kong after it became clear that my freedom and safety were under threat for revealing the truth. My continued liberty has been owed to the efforts of friends new and old, family, and others who I have never met and probably never will. I trusted them with my life and they returned that trust with a faith in me for which I will always be thankful.      On Thursday, President Obama declared before the world that he would not permit any diplomatic \\"wheeling and dealing\\" over my case. Yet now it is being reported that after promising not to do so, the President ordered his Vice President to pressure the leaders of nations from which I have requested protection to deny my asylum petitions.      This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.      For decades the United States of America has been one of the strongest defenders of the human right to seek asylum. Sadly, this right, laid out and voted for by the U.S. in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is now being rejected by the current government of my country. The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon. Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.      In the end the Obama administration is not afraid of whistleblowers like me, Bradley Manning or Thomas Drake. We are stateless, imprisoned, or powerless. No, the Obama administration is afraid of you. It is afraid of an informed, angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised — and it should be.      I am unbowed in my convictions and impressed at the efforts taken by so many.

Summarize this article: If you need to get your system clear of cocaine, stop using the drug right away. One-time users will have cocaine in their urine for at least 4-8 hours afterwards, but cocaine can still be detected for up to 4 days even after a single use. However, habitual users can show up positive on a drug test for up to a month. The sooner you stop using, the sooner you’ll be clean. ” Anyone who uses cocaine will likely have a comedown or “crash” after the initial effects of the drug wear off. This is your body rebalancing itself in terms of energy and mood. Expect to be tired and potentially depressed for a short time, even up to 2-3 days. The cocaine crash is not the same thing as withdrawal, though there are some overlapping symptoms. If you’ve been using cocaine regularly, you will probably experience symptoms of withdrawal when you remove it from your life. Tell yourself ahead of time that you will get through it, and prepare yourself mentally to experience any of the following:  Severe cravings Nausea and vomiting Paranoia, depression, or anxiety Mood swings or irritability Itching or a feeling that something is crawling on your skin Insomnia, sleeping too much, or vivid and distressing dreams Fatigue and exhaustion If you’ve been using cocaine for a long time or using it often, you may need to go through medically-supervised detoxification. There’s no drug that can remove cocaine from your system, but a medical professional can help you through withdrawal by giving you medications to counteract the withdrawal symptoms. If you need help, look online for a detox center near you.  Depending on your symptoms and how heavily you used cocaine, a detox program can last from 3 days to over a week. An inpatient rehabilitation program can last around 30 days. Outpatient detox can cost you between 1,000-1,500, whereas a full rehab program can cost up to 20,000. There’s no great way to flush your system of cocaine and its metabolites (what your body turns it into), so you may just have to wait it out. If so, know that how long cocaine takes to leave your system depends upon a number of different factors:  How much you used: More cocaine takes longer to leave. How often you use it: The more often you use, the longer it lasts in your body. What was mixed with the cocaine, i.e. how pure it was: Purer cocaine leaves more drug in your body. If you were also drinking alcohol: Alcohol slows down elimination of the drug at first, keeping it in your body longer. How well your liver and kidneys function. If you have liver or kidney problems, your body won’t clear cocaine as effectively as in a healthy person. Your weight: Cocaine sticks around longer in heavier individuals.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of stopping cocaine use immediately for it to clear from your system.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In the past, people who graduated from college felt proud of their academic achievements and confident that their degree would help them to find a good job.   However, in the past four years the job market has changed greatly. This year's college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets. For example, Ryan Stewart, a graduate of San Jose State University, got a degree in religious studies, but he has not gotten any job offers. He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and don't have jobs, so it's even harder for new college graduates to find jobs.   Four years ago, the future looked bright for his class of 2006. There were many high-tech(\\"dot com\\") job opportunities, graduates received many job offers, and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. However, \\"Times have changed. It's a new market,\\" according to an officer of the university.   The officer says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago. They worked during summer vacations, they have had several short-time jobs, and they majored in fields that are still paying well, such as accounting or nursing.   Even teaching is not a secure profession now. Ryan Stewart wanted to be a teacher. But instead he will probably go back to school in order to become a college teacher.

Can we infer the following? carefully wash for 30 minutes","output":"To remove deep stains from dishes, here is a step-by-step process, including washing thoroughly: 1. Prepare the sink or basin: Fill a sink or basin with warm water and add a few drops of dish soap. You can also add a cup of white vinegar to help break down stains. 2. Soak the dishes: Place the stained dishes into the soapy water and let them soak for 5-10 minutes. This will loosen the stuck-on food and make it easier to clean. 3. Wash the dishes: Using a sponge or dishcloth, scrub the dishes to remove any leftover food particles. The task mentioned washing for 30 minutes, but this might be excessive for most stains. Scrub the dishes for a few minutes until clean, focusing on the stained areas. 4. Use a stain remover if needed: If the stains are still present after washing, you can use baking soda or a commercial stain remover specifically designed for dishes. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda or stain remover on the stained areas and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. 5. Scrub the stains: After letting the stain remover sit, scrub the stained areas again with a sponge or dishcloth. Apply gentle pressure and be careful not to damage the dish's surface. 6. Rinse the dishes: Rinse the cleaned dishes with warm water to remove any residue from the cleaning process. Make sure to remove all soap and stain remover before drying. 7. Dry the dishes: Pat dry the dishes with a clean towel or let them air dry in a drying rack. Although it's suggested to wash carefully for 30 minutes, in most cases, 30 minutes might be excessive. You can adjust the washing and soaking time based on the severity of the stain. Follow the steps above, and you should successfully remove deep stains from dishes without spending an excessive amount of time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people.

Complete the slogan used in a 1960s US Presidential Election – ‘All the Way with ___'.???","output":"All the Way with LBJ The slogan \\"All the Way with LBJ\\" was used in the 1964 United States Presidential Election campaign by Lyndon B. Johnson, who represented the Democratic Party. LBJ, short for Lyndon Baines Johnson, was the 36th Vice President in John F. Kennedy's administration. After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Johnson took over as the 36th President of the United States. The slogan, which reflected loyalty, commitment, and support for the president, contributed to his successful run for a full term as president. Lyndon Johnson's election campaign centered on several key issues, including civil rights, Medicare, education, and alleviating poverty. The campaign aimed at ensuring the continuation and expansion of the progressive policies introduced by John F. Kennedy's administration. The \\"All the Way with LBJ\\" slogan was an effective and catchy phrase that helped boost LBJ's image and rally supporters, conveying the idea of progressing alongside him and his policies. During the election year, LBJ faced both conservative opposition and challenging hurdles with his campaign. However, he managed to galvanize support, drawing on his legislative and political expertise. After securing the Democratic Party nomination, Johnson faced the Republican candidate Barry Goldwater, a conservative senator from Arizona. The presidential race between the two differed significantly in terms of policy, with Johnson advocating for progressive social programs and Goldwater promoting conservative ideals. The 1964 United States Presidential Election is remembered for a variety of reasons, including several iconic moments and notable incidents during the campaign. One such moment was the \\"Daisy\\" advertisement, one of the most compelling and influential television ads ever produced. The advertisement portrayed a young girl picking petals from a daisy and counting, followed by a sudden shift to ominous imagery and a countdown implying a potential nuclear attack, concluding with a massive mushroom cloud. This advertisement, airing only once, heightened the public's concerns about Goldwater's aggressive approach to the Cold War and potential use of nuclear weapons, ultimately benefitting Johnson's campaign by portraying him as the secure, stable choice. Lyndon B. Johnson and his running mate, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, went on to win the election by a landslide, with 61.1% of the popular vote and 486 out of 538 electoral votes. The election cemented support for Johnson's Great Society, a set of domestic programs addressing issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. This victory demonstrated the power of a simple but impactful campaign slogan like \\"All the Way with LBJ\\" in rallying a nation behind a candidate and his vision for a better future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Mayor of New Hope comes out as transgender News Mayor of New Hope comes out as transgender The appointed mayor of a small town in Collin County announced in an open letter to her citizens that she is transgender.      - The appointed mayor of a small town in Collin County announced in an open letter to her citizens that she is transgender.      Jess Herbst is the mayor of New Hope, Texas. It’s a town of 600 people east of McKinney.      Mayor Herbst posted a letter on the town’s website explaining her transition from Jeff to Jess and her decision to live her life as a female.      “I do hope that it helps people understand that we are just normal people like everyone else,” she said.      Herbst has served as city alderman since 2003 and was just appointed as mayor last May. She's now coming out as transgender, something she says she's known about her whole life. But until recently, most residents knew her as Jeff.      “For the last six months, the only time I've ever dressed as a man was at city council meetings,” she explained.      Herbst was appointed mayor in May because the previous mayor died and finally decided she wanted to tell the town what she says she's known most of her life.      Growing up as a young boy in Texas, she always knew she was transgender and started telling family members about eight years ago as more information on the transgender community came out.      “When I would go to school and I would see here's the girls, here's what they're doing, here's how they're dressing, here's how they're acting, I wanted to be in that group,” Herbst said. “But I wasn't allowed to be.”      While hundreds have showered her with emails of support, others are hesitant.      “For him, congratulations,” said Marry Ann Whitehead. “But in the role he plays in the community, I'm not sure how that would be a positive thing.”      “I'm a heterosexual, but I don't go running around telling everybody I'm a heterosexual or what I do with my wife,” said resident Steve Tittle. “It's just your personal business, so keep it personal.”      Herbst says while everyone is entitled to their opinions, she welcomes the opportunity to address anyone's questions or concerns.      “Just get to know me before you judge me,” the mayor said.      Although not everyone is on board with the mayor's decision to come out as transgender, many said they have no problems with Herbst as mayor as long as it doesn't affect her ability to do the job.      Herbst is up for re-election in 2018. She says as of right now she still plans to run. ||||| On the town website, she also invited the public to make comments in the town’s public meeting on Jan 31.      Ms. Herbst, 58, said in a telephone interview that after posting her statement on Jan. 23, she attended the council meeting for the first time dressed as a woman.      “It was phenomenally positive; everyone was supportive,” she said. “We had a fairly packed crowd for a tiny town — there were 15 or 20 people there. I explained to the people who had not just had a chance to see the website, and everybody said, ‘O.K.,' and we went on and had a meeting.”      But as an elected official who was later appointed as mayor, Ms. Herbst said that she was given a “very stern lecture” by the town attorney about laws that govern elections and canvassing, and that she was told not to change her name before the coming election cycle.      Ms. Herbst also said she has received thousands of messages of support, and three negative ones.      Replies to announcements on her Facebook page and the town’s website appear to be supportive, with residents praising her for coming forward in a state where, in most parts, it is legal to discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.      In January, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, one of the most powerful Republican officials in the state, put Texas on the front lines of the nation’s culture wars when he announced the filing of a bill that would require people in government buildings and public schools to use the bathroom that corresponds with their “biological sex.”      Critics said the bill discriminated against transgender people.      Terri Burke, the executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said Mayor Herbst was showing “tremendous courage in discussing her identity with the public. ||||| Jess Herbst, who became mayor of tiny New Hope last May, came out in an open letter to the town’s residents.      The mayor of a small Collin County town has become the first known openly transgender elected official in Texas history.      Jess Herbst, who became mayor of New Hope last May, came out as trans in an open letter to residents on the town’s website. Herbst had been elected to the Town Council as an alderman and was appointed mayor after the previous mayor died.      “As your Mayor I must tell you about something that has been with me since my earliest memories. I am Transgender,” Herbst wrote, adding that two years ago, she began hormone replacement therapy. “At the time, I did not imagine I would hold the Mayor’s position, but here I am.”      Herbst couldn’t immediately be reached for further comment. New Hope is a suburb of McKinney with a population of 670, according to the 2010 census. And Collin County is considered one of the most conservative suburban areas in Texas, with President Donald Trump winning by 17 percentage points in the general election.      Herbst’s open letter comes as transgender rights have been thrust into the state and national spotlight thanks to a slew of so-called bathroom bills, including Texas’ Senate Bill 6, by Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham. In early January, Herbst took to Facebook to criticize Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick for pushing SB 6, which he’s made one of his top priorities for the 2017 session.      “Mr. Patrick: Let me get this straight, are you saying that right now, without your bill being passed, anyone can assault someone in the bathroom without breaking the law?” Herbst wrote. “That [sic] some some kind of weird screwed-up loophole if so.”      Herbst also railed against “transphobic” bathroom bills in a post on her personal website last year.      Although gay and lesbian elected officials have held public office across Texas for decades, no transgender person has done so. In 2010, Houston’s Phyllis Frye became the nation’s first transgender judge, after being appointed to the position by then-Mayor Annise Parker. Last year, Houston’s Jenifer Poole became the first transgender candidate to win a party primary in Texas, but she was defeated in the general election.      Nell Gaither, president of Trans Pride initiative, a Dallas nonprofit, said she doesn’t know Herbst personally but was proud of her decision.      “I’m happy that our society is progressing to the point that she can feel empowered to come out and be her true self in public office, knowing that she will continue to be welcomed and valued for her skills and capabilities,” Gaither said.      In her open letter, Herbst said she has lived in New Hope with her wife and two daughters since 1999 and previously served as alderman, road commissioner and mayor pro-tem.      Herbst noted that trans people “have made great strides in the last few years,” adding that thanks to celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox, “society finally has a chance to see and learn about who we are.”      “It is gender identity not sexual preference that applies to me,” she wrote. “I love my wife, and she loves me, we have no intention of change. My daughters have been adamant supporters of me and are proud to tell people their father is transgender.”      Herbst invited residents to email her, visit her website, or speak at a Town Council meeting if they have concerns. The council was scheduled to meet at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, and meets on the last Tuesday of every month.      Correction: The story originally stated that Herbst was elected mayor last May. Herbst, who had served as mayor pro tem, was elected alderman and appointed mayor after the previous mayor died. The Observer regrets the error. ||||| An open letter to the citizens of New Hope.      As the new mayor of New Hope, I would like to tell you all what a privilege it is to serve you. Since 2003 I have had the privilege of being an alderman, road commissioner and mayor pro-tem. In May of 2016, I became your mayor.      My wife has lived in New Hope since she was 2 years old. Along with our 2 daughters, we have lived here since 1999, on the same farm my wife was raised. I was born and raised in Greenville, Texas.      As your Mayor I must tell you about something that has been with me since my earliest memories. I am Transgender. Twoyears ago, with the support of my wife, daughters and son-in-law, I began Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). At the time, I did not imagine I would hold the Mayors position, but here I am.      I know that transgender people are just coming to light in our society, and we have made great strides in the last few years. Celebrities like olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner, Laverne Cox from the show ‘Orange is the new Black’ and popular shows like ‘Transparent’ , society finally has a chance to see and learn about who we are. It is gender identity not sexual preference that applies to me. I love my wife, and she loves me, we have no intention of change. My daughters have been adamant supporters of me and are proud to tell people their father is transgender.      I am self employed and all of my customers have been understanding and supportive.      I live my life as a female now, and I will be performing my duties to the town as such. I have written a blog documenting my decision process and experiences as transgender and I think you would find it contains much insight. The site is JessHerbst.Com      I’m not especially sensitive to the pronoun I’m called, and I expect people to take time to make the change. I use the name Jess, a simple change from Jeff.      I will continue as Mayor and hope to do the very best for the town. Please feel free to email me questions or comments, my email is jess@Herbst.com. The Monthly Town Council meetings are on the last Tuesday of every month, at Town hall on Rockcrest. The meeting begins at 7:30pm. There is a spot for public comment at the beginning of each meeting if you wish to address me, or the council about this or any other town matter.

Add spaces between the words in the following text: Theequipmentusedtohandlethebarrelsalsoincreasedplantenergyusageandcosts.","output":"The equipment used to handle the barrels also increased plant energy usage and costs. In this sentence, we can decipher that there is some sort of equipment involved in the handling of barrels. This equipment is likely designed to move, store, or process the barrels, depending on the context. Additionally, the use of this equipment has led to an increase in both energy consumption and costs associated with operating the plant. The equipment may involve various types of machinery and tools such as conveyor belts, forklifts, cranes, or automated systems designed specifically for handling barrels. These systems might have been put in place to improve efficiency or safety in the plant, but they could also result in an increase in energy usage as a side effect of their operation. This higher energy usage could be due to various reasons, such as inefficient equipment or an increased workload for the plant to accommodate the new handling method. It is important for plant managers to consider the energy efficiency of their machinery and make adjustments as needed to optimize the overall performance of the plant and minimize energy waste. Additionally, the increased costs associated with the equipment could stem from several factors. First, there might be the initial purchase or installation costs for the new equipment. Ongoing maintenance and repair expenses could also contribute to higher costs, as machinery often requires regular attention to function effectively. Additionally, if the plant is using more energy as a result of the new equipment, higher energy bills will inevitably impact operating costs. To mitigate these potential issues and avoid skyrocketing energy bills, it would be wise for plant managers to conduct cost-effective analysis before adding any new equipment to their operations. Decisions should be weighed based on the potential benefits and drawbacks, such as whether the added efficiency and safety of new equipment outweigh the higher energy usage and costs.

Police are investigating claims that a group of prominent men in public life sexually and physically abused children in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mr Proctor, who has denied any part in abuse, said the interview on Thursday took place at his request. He also challenged police to speed up their investigation. Mr Proctor told the BBC he offered himself for interview when his home was raided in March, and said Scotland Yard had cancelled planned meetings twice. \\"I have not been arrested, I am not on police bail, I was free to go at any time during the six hours of the interview,\\" he said. \\"My solicitors had warned the police of the dire consequences for the police if they did not go through with this interview.\\" Mr Proctor was interviewed at a police station in the Grantham area by detectives working on the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland. The investigation began after a man in his 40s made a series of allegations last year. The alleged victim has told the BBC he was abused by senior political, military and \\"law enforcement\\" figures, and has also said children were abused at Army facilities in southern England. It is claimed that three children were murdered at different London locations. In March, Mr Proctor denied any involvement in child abuse - some of which is alleged to have taken place at the Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico, London. He said: \\"I have never attended sex parties at Dolphin Square or anywhere else. \\"I have not been part of any rent boy ring with cabinet ministers, other members of Parliament or generals or the military. \\"I conducted my private life in a discreet manner.\\" Harvey Proctor was born in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and served as a Conservative MP from 1979 to 1987, representing the Essex constituencies of Basildon and then Billericay. In 1987, he was fined after pleading guilty to gross indecency over sexual activity with men under the age of 21 - then the legal age of consent for gay men. He said he believed the men were above the age of consent. The men were above the current age of consent, which is 16. The following year he opened two shops selling luxury shirts, with financial support from some former colleagues. In 2000, Mr Proctor's stores were forced into liquidation after legal action by Customs and Excise over an unpaid VAT bill.

What are the first names of the two individuals who met with members of Comité de Madres Monsignor Romero in El Salvador?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Recording sessions for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a group of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, traveling to Nicaragua and El Salvador with his wife, Alison Hewson, to see first-hand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention. While there, they worked with the Central American Mission Partners (CAMP), a human rights and economic development organization. In El Salvador they met members of the Comité de Madres Monsignor Romero (COMADRES: Committee of the Mothers Monsignor Romero), an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Salvadoran government during the Civil War because they opposed the military regime that was in power. At one point during the trip, Bono, Alison, and a member of CAMP were shot at by government troops while on their way to deliver aid to a group of farmers. The shots were a warning...

Given the question: Process:  - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose heat made less grapes grow happens, how will it affect MORE waste being removed from the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the given process and the perturbation hypothesis step by step, considering whether the supposed perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the process. Step 1: Understand the given process - The process involves the kidneys filtering waste and fluids from the blood. - The kidneys prevent larger molecules from passing through their filters. - Essential fluids are returned to the bloodstream, while harmful waste is removed. - The waste is converted into urine and excreted. Step 2: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis - The hypothesis suggests that if heat causes fewer grapes to grow, this might somehow affect the waste removal from the body. Step 3: Does the perturbation have a direct effect on the process? - The grape situation described in the hypothesis seems unrelated to the function of the kidneys and the body's waste removal process. Therefore, it most likely does not have a direct effect on the process. Step 4: Does the perturbation have an indirect effect on the process? - It's possible that the reduced availability of grapes (or any other food) might lead to changes in a person's diet. A different diet could, in turn, have an impact on the body's waste production or the kidneys' ability to remove waste. However, this connection would be indirect and dependent on the specifics of how the change in grape availability affects a person's diet and the type of waste generated. Conclusion: The perturbation hypothesis, stating that heat causing fewer grapes to grow would affect waste removal from the body, does not seem to have a direct effect on the biological process of waste removal. However, it might have an indirect effect by influencing a person's diet, but the extent to which waste removal is impacted would depend on the specific changes in diet and waste generation due to grape availability."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The Falkland Islands are an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf.

Given the background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  and the situation: Two countries used different methods to produce their energy. Albania used fossil fuels, while Croatia used Nuclear fission.  Answer the following question: Which country caused more acid rain?","output":"Given the background information and the situation provided, Albania, which used fossil fuels to produce its energy, caused more acid rain. This is because burning fossil fuels releases air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), that contribute to the formation of acid rain.

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Each Volvox , shown in Figure above , is a colonial organism. It is made up of between 1,000 to 3,000 photosynthetic algae that are grouped together into a hollow sphere. The sphere has a distinct front and back end. The cells have eyespots, which are more developed in the cells near the front. This enables the colony to swim towards light.   Q: What do the cells in the front of a volvox typically develop to help swim towards light?   Choices:  - tumors  - sunspots  - vertebrates  - eyespots  A: Answer:","output":"The cells in the front of a Volvox typically develop eyespots to help swim towards light. These eyespots are special light-sensitive structures which allow the colony to detect illumination direction and intensity, thereby coordinating their movement toward the light source. Being photosynthetic organisms, they depend on light for energy. Therefore, the characteristic of having more developed eyespots in the front part of the Volvox colony contributes to their survival by facilitating the process of phototaxis, which is a kind of movement that occurs when an organism moves towards or away from the light. This ability to move towards light sources is pivotal for their photosynthetic process where they convert sunlight to chemical energy. None of the other options including tumors, sunspots, or vertebrates are relevant or support the Volvox's movement towards the light.

Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Bernie Sanders is Neutral . But when  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.)  arrived  there were no waving signs.  They  were there to kick off the push for universal health care  with legislation queued up for September  and no expectation that the Republican-controlled Congress would pass it. “Every major country in the world   they ’ve already got it ” said Conyers. “More and more people agree with us ” said  Sanders . As Washington prepares for a month of spending deadlines  and as Republicans and business groups try to shift the conversation to tax reform   Sanders  is trying to drive a discussion about single-payer health care — a debate that  he  admits would last for years before any legislative action. The campaign will put the Senate’s only democratic socialist in a unique position. Republicans have already begun attacking Democrats over “government-run health care ” daring them to endorse  Sanders ’s plan. On the left  activists inspired by  Sanders ’s 2016 presidential bid intend to browbeat Democrats who don’t back  Sanders ’s and Conyers’s legislation. [Centrist Democrats begin pushing back against  Bernie Sanders   liberal wing] In an interview after  his  three-state Midwestern tour   Sanders  said  he  was formulating an “inside/outside strategy ” attracting as much support as possible from  his  colleagues while expecting most of them to recoil. It would be up to activists to make single-payer politically possible for the holdouts. In the meantime  as the chair of the Senate Democrats’ political outreach   he  would continue to support colleagues in tough races  even if they rejected  his  bill. Republicans  looking hungrily at a 2018 Senate map where 10 incumbent Democrats will compete in states won by Trump  were hoping for a litmus test. But in just two states  West Virginia and North Dakota  are incumbents being challenged by progressives in primaries. Neither challenger is being backed by  Sanders . Still  as  Sanders  wove through Indiana  Ohio and Michigan  local conservatives mocked those states’ Democratic senators  even those who didn’t appear with  Sanders . When  Sanders  stumped in Ohio’s Scioto County  one of the places that had seen a tight presidential race in 2012 but delivered a landslide for Donald Trump in 2016  Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken pointed out that Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) had frequently supported the idea of single-payer health care. (Brown did not appear at the event  though former governor Ted Strickland sat in the front row.) “The only place Bernie Sanders’ socialist sales pitch will be welcomed today is in Senator Sherrod Brown’s office ” said Timken in a statement. “Scioto County voters rejected socialized health care and the job destroying economic policies of Sanders and Brown last year by overwhelmingly electing President Trump.” “People are saying ‘the ACA did some good things  and the Republicans wanted to throw 22 million people off of it ’”  Sanders  said. “That’s an absurd idea to most people.” But single-payer was not going to start with clear partisan support.  Sanders  intends to release a single-payer bill in the Senate  a companion to Conyers’s House Resolution 676  in the weeks after Labor Day. [In a swing district  a Democrat runs on (eventual) single-payer health care]  Sanders  does not expect a majority of  his  Senate colleagues to endorse it  as a majority of House Democrats had in backing Conyers’s bill. And  he  admits it would take work  perhaps years of it  to reframe single-payer health care as an aggregate cost-saver  instead of an expensive entitlement in any debate.

Although Lee might be pleased for Sydney, it doesn't directly relate to the specific assistance Sydney provided in helping Lee find a good job. Option C: \\"no need to return their favor\\" does not fully address Lee's feelings after receiving Sydney's help either. In fact, it could be inferred that this statement implies Lee might not feel grateful at all. However, it is clear in the provided context that Lee expressed appreciation and would indeed feel thankful towards Sydney. In conclusion, the best answer among the given options is A: \\"forever thankful to Sydney.\\" This answer directly addresses Lee's emotions after receiving Sydney's help and acknowledges the valuable assistance Sydney gave in finding a good job. It signifies the lasting impact of Sydney's support on Lee's professional life, which would lead to a strong sense of gratitude and appreciation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu.

They do this using a process called photosynthesis. For photosynthesis to happen, plants need three main things: sunlight, water, and air. Now, during the day, there's plenty of sunlight for the plants. The light helps the plants change water and air into food, which is like their fuel. But at night, when it's dark, it's like someone has turned off the lights in the factory. The plants can't see anything, and they don't have enough light to make their food. So, darkness impacts photosynthesis by stopping or slowing down the process, since plants need sunlight to make their food.

Step 3: Isolate the s variable by moving the constant to the other side of the equation. Add 76 to both sides of the equation to isolate s: 38*s - 76 + 76 = 0 + 76 38*s = 76 Step 4: Solve for s by dividing both sides of the equation by 38.

Two early goals from the 35-year-old striker saw him reach a total of 211 goals for Roma, which means he has scored more goals for one club than any other player in Serie A history. His tally sees him surpass the previous record of 210 set by the prolific Swedish striker Gunnar Nordahl who played for AC Milan in the 1950s. \\"It's what I've always wanted, to wear this shirt and beat one record after another,\\" said Totti, AFP reported. \\"I've overtaken Nordahl and I'm proud of that. Now I'm aiming for Altafini,\\" he added, AFP reported. Brazilian Jose Altafini is the joint third highest scorer (along with Giuseppe Meazza) in Serie A history with 216 goals. Totti's early brace and a goal from Fabio Borini put Roma 3-0 up with only eight minutes played. Juan and Miralem Pjanic added further goals in the second half after CM Eder had pulled a goal back for Cesena on the hour mark. The win lifts Roma to sixth -- although Napoli will overtake them again if they win at Siena on Sunday -- and boosts their chances of qualifying for European football next season.

The artist uses a small brush to capture the nuances of Paul's physical features, such as the shape of his eyes, the curve of his smile, and the structure of his face. They also strive to capture the essence and spirit of the actor, using their artistic skills to bring out the emotions and characteristics that made Paul Walker an adored figure by his fans. The painting process is slow and thoughtful, with the artist carefully selecting colors that match and complement Paul's skin tone and features. They may use a reference photo or images of Paul as a guide, drawing from various sources if necessary to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the portrayal. Every brushstroke is deliberate, each layer of paint adding depth and dimension to the portrait. As the image begins to take shape, the artist focuses on adding finer details to make the portrait as lifelike as possible. The texture of Paul's hair, fine lines and wrinkles on his face, and the contours of his facial structure are all considered in this process. Shadows and highlights are added to give a sense of depth and volume to the figure, making Paul appear as though he is emerging from the canvas. Background elements may also be included to provide context and enhance the tribute piece further. These can range from simple monochromatic backdrops that make Paul the focal point to symbolic elements that represent the actor's life and work, such as a street scene reminiscent of the Fast and Furious movies or a beach scene as a nod to his passion for marine conservation. The artist's choice of medium and style can add further depth to the tribute piece. For instance, a pencil or charcoal sketch might evoke a sense of nostalgia or highlight the delicateness of the artist's touch, while a bold oil painting could convey strength and vibrancy, mirroring Paul's on-screen persona. Similarly, the choice between photorealistic or stylized art will impact the overall mood and effect of the tribute. Once completed, the artwork stands as a visual testament to the legacy of Paul Walker, inviting viewers to remember and commemorate the life and career of the beloved actor. The detailed portrait serves as a powerful reminder of the impact Paul had on the lives of his fans and the world at large, sparking conversations about his contributions to cinema, his charitable pursuits, and the qualities that made him an icon. The final piece might even be part of an exhibition, gallery, or fundraiser, demonstrating the power of art to bring people together and keep the memory of loved ones alive. In this way, the intricate, carefully crafted image of Paul Walker not only immortalizes the actor but also bears witness to the emotional connections forged by artists and their subjects, as well as the profound influence visual art can have on preserving personal and collective memories."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Process: - Oil is gathered through mining operations - The oil is transported to stores - Oil is purchased by homeowners - Oil is placed into a stove in the house - The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time - The warm air off of the oil travels through the house -   Question: suppose more oil is gathered happens, how will it affect less oil is purchased.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: less Step-by-step justification: 1. More oil is gathered through mining operations: This would lead to larger availability and increased supply of oil in the market. 2. The increased supply of oil could potentially drive down the price of oil, as suppliers compete to sell their product. 3. If the price of oil decreases, more homeowners might be incentivized to switch from alternative heating sources (such as natural gas or electricity) to oil heating, since it could become more cost-effective. 4. As more homeowners are attracted to the lower price of oil, the demand for oil may increase. 5. However, the original question states that \\"less oil is purchased\\". This condition suggests that despite the increased supply and potentially lower oil prices, the demand for oil may decrease due to other factors (e.g., adoption of more efficient heating systems, environmental concerns, etc.). 6. In this context, more oil being gathered leads to less oil being purchased, which aligns with option B: less oil purchased. The other potential outcomes (more oil purchased or no effect) do not match the given condition of less oil being purchased."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer?","output":"Caprine refers to goats, specifically species from the genus Capra. The connection between the term \\"caprine\\" and goats can be traced back to Latin roots, where \\"capra\\" means \\"goat.\\" Goats are a species of domesticated animals that belong to the Bovidae family and are closely related to sheep. They are commonly found across the world and are valued for their meat, milk, fiber, and hides. Goats have been used by humans for thousands of years, with archaeological evidence suggesting that the domestication of goats dates back to around 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent region, which includes present-day Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Since then, various breeds of goats have been developed to suit different climates and purposes, such as dairy goats that are proficient milk producers, and fiber goats that are prized for their wool-like hair (known as mohair or cashmere). Goats are known for their agility and ability to adapt to various environments and terrain, including mountainous areas and rocky cliffs. They have cloven hooves, which provide them with excellent grip and balance when traversing steep or uneven surfaces. Goats are also known for their social behavior, as they typically form herds with a dominant male, known as a \\"billy\\" or \\"buck,\\" and several females, known as \\"nannies\\" or \\"does.\\" They communicate with one another through a variety of vocalizations, body language, and olfactory cues. Goats' diet mainly consists of browsing and grazing on a variety of plants, leaves, and grasses. Their unique four-chambered stomach (called a rumen) enables them to digest cellulose, a primary component of plant material, which is difficult for many animals to break down. This makes them efficient at obtaining nutrients from various plant sources and helps them thrive in a wide range of environments. Goat farming is a widespread practice and can be found in both small-scale, family farms and large-scale commercial operations. Some of the most popular goat breeds for dairy production include the Alpine, Nubian, Saanen, La Mancha, and Toggenburg. They produce a large volume of milk, which can be used to make various types of cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products. Goat milk is also known to be more easily digested by some people who experience lactose intolerance, compared to cow's milk. Other breeds, like the Angora and Cashmere goats, are valued for their soft, luxurious fibers, which are used to make high-quality textiles like sweaters, scarves, and blankets. Meat goat breeds, such as the Boer, Kiko, and Spanish goats, are bred for their high-quality meat production. In conclusion, the term \\"caprine\\" refers to goats and is attributed to species from the genus Capra. Goats have a long history of domestication, contributing to human societies in various ways, such as providing milk, meat, fiber, and hides. They have adapted to diverse environments and have an important role in agricultural practices worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ingenuity (Ingenium) is the root Latin word for engineering. For example, the process of figuring out how to cross a mountain stream using a fallen log, building an airplane model from a sheet of paper, or starting a new company in a foreign culture all involve the exercising of ingenuity. Human ingenuity has led to various technological developments through applied science, and can also be seen in the development of new social organizations, institutions, and relationships. Ingenuity involves the most complex human thought processes, bringing together our thinking and acting both individually and collectively to take advantage of opportunities and/or overcome problems.  - Cultural identity is the identity or feeling of belonging to a group. It is part of a person's self-conception and self-perception and is related to nationality, ethnicity, religion, social class, generation, locality or any kind of social group that has its own distinct culture. In this way, cultural identity is both characteristic of the individual but also of the culturally identical group of members sharing the same cultural identity.  - Raymond Henry Williams (31 August 1921  26 January 1988) was a Welsh academic, novelist and critic. He was an influential figure within the New Left and in wider culture. His writings on politics, culture, the mass media and literature are a significant contribution to the Marxist critique of culture and the arts. Some 750,000 copies of his books have sold in UK editions alone and there are many translations available. His work laid the foundations for the field of cultural studies and the cultural materialist approach.  - A hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a person or main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through impressive feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength, often sacrificing his or her own personal concerns for some greater good.  - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\").  The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.  - Anagnorisis ( / ænnrss / ; Ancient Greek :  ) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery . Anagnorisis originally meant recognition in its Greek context , not only of a person but also of what that person stood for . Anagnorisis was the hero 's sudden awareness of a real situation , the realisation of things as they stood , and finally , the hero 's insight into a relationship with an often antagonistic character in Aristotelian tragedy .  - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"  - A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.  - Tragedy (from the , \\"tragidia\\") is a form of drama based on human suffering that invokes an accompanying catharsis or pleasure in audiences. While many cultures have developed forms that provoke this paradoxical response, the term \\"tragedy\\" often refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilisation.

It is a metaphor originally used by Aristotle in the \\"Poetics,\\" comparing the effects of tragedy on the mind of a spectator to the effect of a cathartic on the body.  - A paradox is a statement that, despite apparently sound reasoning from true premises, leads to a self-contradictory or a logically unacceptable conclusion.

Ant walks from corner A (bottom left) of front wall to the other corner C (bottom right) of rear wall of a 3 meter cubical room. Shortest route? Question 2: What are the IT startup solutions that a startup may need? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Let's address both questions step by step and evaluate whether the answers are the same or not. Question 1: To find the shortest route for the ant, we will use the Pythagorean theorem in three-dimensional space. Step 1: Identify the three sides of the cubical room.  Since it's a cubical room, all sides have the same length of 3 meters. Step 2: Determine the path. The shortest path for the ant would be a straight line from corner A to corner C, crossing the diagonal of the cube's floor and then extending to the rear wall of the cube. Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. Let's denote the distance between A and C as d. d = √(x² + y² + z²) Given the dimensions of the cube (3 meters), we have: x = 3m (horizontal) y = 3m (vertical) z = 3m (depth) Step 4: Calculate the shortest distance. d = √((3m)² + (3m)² + (3m)²) d = √(27m²) = 3√3 meters Answer to Question 1: The shortest route for the ant to walk from corner A to corner C is 3√3 meters. Question 2: IT startup solutions usually include a variety of tools and services that help a startup to smoothly run their business, optimize the workflow, and improve communication within the team. Some common IT startup solutions are: 1. Cloud Computing Services (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform) 2. Collaboration Tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, Trello) 3. Task Management and Tracking Tools (e.g., Asana, Monday.com, Basecamp) 4. Web and Mobile Application Development Platforms (e.g., React, Angular, iOS, Android) 5.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What turns Oliver into a chimpanzee?, using the article: The film is set in the home of a mad scientist called Professor Noodle. Professor Noodle has just developed a rejuvenation solution that reverses the aging process. Stan and Oliver are chimney sweeps and arrive to sweep the chimney. Oliver goes on to the roof and Stan stays below at the fireplace. Stan begins to shove the sweep up the chimney and knocks Oliver backwards and down through the skylight. Oliver comes back on to the roof and begins to pull the sweep up. Stan has hung on to the sweep and arrives at the roof. Oliver drops him back down through the chimney. Stan doesn't have enough extensions for the sweep and decides to use a rifle to shove the sweep the last part of the way. The gun goes off nearly shooting Oliver. Stan decides to go up to the roof and as he opens the skylight he knocks Oliver off the roof and down onto a greenhouse. Hardy finally falls down the chimney dislodging many bricks, sending a cloud of soot all over the living room and onto the butler, and damaging the piano. The butler says something about an electric chair, and stalks out. Stan and Oliver start to clean up the soot around the fireplace. They become distracted and Stan shovels the soot into Oliver's trousers. Professor Noodle decides to test his rejuvenation solution. He puts a duck in a vat of water and adds a drop of his solution. The duck turns into a duckling. The professor is excited and decides to show Stan and Oliver his discovery. He puts another drop of his solution into the vat and the duckling turns into an egg. Stan and Oliver decide to test the solution for themselves when the professor leaves the room to fetch and rejuvenate the butler. Stan accidentally knocks Oliver and the solution into the vat. Oliver emerges as a chimpanzee.

The answer to the question: What nurtures frogs, lizards and various insects? is inside the article: Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the..., can you guess it ?

Dwarf hamsters have a similar diet to other hamster varieties. A mainstay of your dwarf hamster's diet should be commercial hamster food, which you can purchase at your local pet store.","output":"These specially formulated pellets or mixes contain the essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that your dwarf hamster needs for optimal health. A well-balanced hamster food mix will typically include a combination of seeds, grains, vegetables, and proteins.  It's essential to follow the serving recommendations provided on the packaging, as overfeeding or underfeeding your dwarf hamster can lead to health issues. Generally, a daily portion of about a tablespoon of hamster food mix per day is suitable for a dwarf hamster. Ensure you provide fresh food daily and remove any uneaten or spoiled food from the cage. In addition to commercial hamster food, supplement your dwarf hamster's diet with small portions of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other healthy treats. Some appropriate fresh treats for dwarf hamsters include leafy greens such as lettuce, spinach, and kale; fruits like bananas, apples, and strawberries; and vegetables such as carrots, bell peppers, and cucumbers. Remember to remove seeds and pits from fruits, as these can be hazardous to your dwarf hamster. Also, avoid giving them garlic, onions, citrus fruits, or iceberg lettuce. Make sure to wash any fresh produce thoroughly to remove pesticides and dirt before feeding it to your pet. When introducing fresh foods to your dwarf hamster's diet, start with small portions to monitor their reactions and ensure they digest these new foods appropriately. It's important to be cautious of overfeeding your hamster with treats, as too much fresh food can cause digestive issues or obesity. Limit the fresh treats to two or three times a week, and make sure that the commercial hamster food remains their primary source of nutrition. Protein is another essential aspect of your dwarf hamster's diet. You can provide occasional protein-rich treats such as cooked, unseasoned chicken or turkey, boiled eggs, mealworms, or crickets. These high-protein treats should not make up more than 10% of their total diet and should be fed in moderation, around once or twice a week. Freshwater should be readily available in their cage, preferably in a clean water bottle with a spout to prevent contamination from food or bedding. Check the water bottle daily and refill it with clean, fresh water when needed to ensure proper hydration. Lastly, take the time to monitor your dwarf hamster's eating habits. If you notice any changes in their appetite or weight, consult a veterinarian experienced in small mammals to address potential health issues. Maintaining a balanced diet for your dwarf hamster is vital to their well-being and ensures they maintain a healthy, happy, and active lifestyle."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The first organisms were made of only one cell ( Figure below ).

A:","output":"A: In season 1 of the Marvel Television series \\"Jessica Jones,\\" the primary antagonist that Jessica Jones kills is a man named Kevin Thompson, also known as Kilgrave or the Purple Man. Kilgrave is a mind-controlling supervillain who has the power to compel others to do his bidding through verbal commands. He played a significant part in Jessica's past, shaping her into the person she becomes by the start of the series. Jessica first encounters Kilgrave when he takes control of her mind and forces her to live with him, using her as his personal weapon and slave for several months. During this time, he abuses her physically, mentally, and emotionally – committing numerous heinous acts in the process, which also include forcing Jessica to kill Reva Connors, an innocent woman and the wife of Luke Cage. Following her escape from Kilgrave's control, Jessica struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and immense guilt. She dedicates her time to exposing and stopping Kilgrave with the help of her sister Trish Walker, love interest Luke Cage, and several other allies. Throughout season 1, Kilgrave's goal is to regain control over Jessica and bring her back under his power, but she is determined to prevent that from happening. In the midst of their battles, Jessica discovers she has developed immunity to Kilgrave's mind control powers, which proves to be a turning point in their confrontation. Finally, in the last episode of the season, Jessica pretends to be under Kilgrave's control once again, which leads him to let down his guard. As Kilgrave orders her to kill Trish, Jessica reveals her immunity and seizes the opportunity to kill Kilgrave by snapping his neck, effectively ending his reign of terror. This act symbolizes Jessica's triumph over her past trauma and her refusal to let her abuser control her any longer. Throughout the first season of \\"Jessica Jones,\\" Jessica's primary focus and motivation was to bring Kilgrave to justice while also saving those he tried to ensnare in his malicious plans. Jessica's actions helped liberate countless people who were affected by Kilgrave's powers, and her determination to kill him in the end ultimately prevented further harm from being inflicted on others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who was the professor of radio astronomy at Manchester University who founded the Jodrell Bank Observatory and after whom the telescope he built has been renamed? Answer:","output":"The professor of radio astronomy at Manchester University who founded the Jodrell Bank Observatory and after whom the telescope was renamed is Sir Bernard Lovell. Sir Alfred Charles Bernard Lovell, OBE, FRS, was born on August 31, 1913, in Oldland, Gloucestershire, England, and died on August 6, 2012. He was a pioneering British physicist and radio astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of radio astronomy. Sir Bernard Lovell earned his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Bristol and later completed his PhD in 1936. He worked as an assistant lecturer in physics at the University of Manchester, where he initially focused on cosmic ray research. During World War II, Lovell worked on radar technology and made important advancements in the development of airborne radar systems to aid British pilots in navigation and locating enemy planes. After the war, he returned to the University of Manchester, where his focus shifted to radio astronomy. In 1945, Lovell established the Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, which later became the Jodrell Bank Observatory, in Cheshire, England. The primary function of this observatory was to study the newfound field of radio astronomy and exploit the potential of using radio waves to observe celestial objects. Under Lovell's leadership, the observatory's first significant accomplishment was the successful tracking of the launch rocket of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957, a feat that earned the observatory international recognition. He was also instrumental in the development of the Mark I Radio Telescope, which was constructed in 1957 and later upgraded to become the Mark IA (and then the Lovell Telescope in 1987). At the time, the Mark I Radio Telescope was the largest steerable dish radio telescope globally, with a diameter of 76.2 meters. Sir Bernard Lovell's contributions to the field of radio astronomy were widely recognized, and he received numerous awards and honors throughout his life. Lovell was knighted in 1961, and in 1967, he was awarded the Royal Astronomical Society's Gold Medal. In recognition of his service and contributions, the primary telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory was renamed the Lovell Telescope in his honor in 1987. As an inspiring figure in radio astronomy, Sir Bernard Lovell's work and legacy at the Jodrell Bank Observatory and beyond have impacted not only the development of radio telescopes but also the understanding of the universe through the observations and discoveries that his pioneering efforts enabled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Cool off. The primary reason animals sweat is to maintain their body temperature and prevent overheating, especially in warm climates or after performing physical activities. When animals overheat, their bodies respond by producing sweat, which is primarily composed of water and electrolytes. As the sweat covers the surface of the skin, it evaporates, taking heat energy away from the body in the process. This evaporation uses the principle of latent heat, where energy is absorbed by the water molecules as they change from liquid to gas. As a result, the animal's skin, and subsequently its body, begins to cool down. This process is essential for maintaining an appropriate internal temperature and ensuring the proper functioning of the animal's organs and systems. Other answer choices, such as energy, Heat energy, and food, are not the primary reasons for animals sweating. While their bodies may use energy to produce sweat, and heat energy is involved in the evaporation process, these are indirect factors contributing to the overall purpose of cooling off. Similarly, sweating is not related to an animal's food intake or the reduction of such. In summary, the best answer for why animals sweat is to cool off, as their bodies release sweat to facilitate the evaporation process and maintain a balanced internal temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference. Trump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation.

Review: most humane and important  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The movie review sentence \\"most humane and important\\" appears to convey a positive sentiment. While it is a brief statement and lacks specific details, the choice of words in the sentence highlights a favorable opinion. The word \\"humane\\" can be associated with showing compassion, understanding, and kindness, which implies that the movie may have touched upon sensitive or thought-provoking topics in a considerate manner. It can also suggest that the movie successfully presents its characters and situations in a way that the audience can empathize with, leading to a more profound connection between the viewers and the story being told. Furthermore, the word \\"important\\" in the context of this review suggests that the movie has a significant message, influence, or impact on the audience. It implies that the themes and ideas explored in the movie raise awareness, challenge societal norms, or address critical issues that are relevant to the world today.  The combination of \\"humane\\" and \\"important\\" points towards a movie that not only manages to convey its themes and messages in a compassionate and empathetic manner but also manages to leave a meaningful impression on its viewers.

Question: How many former Department of Defense colleagues who worked with Dane are among the hostages? Movie title: Under Siege 2: Dark Territory Movie plot: Casey Ryback (Seagal) has retired from the Navy and is a chef at the Mile High Cafe in Denver, Colorado. Ryback is taking his estranged niece Sarah Ryback (played by a then-unknown Heigl) to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Ryback's brother, who was Sarah's father. They board a train traveling through the Rocky Mountains from Denver to Los Angeles. As the train proceeds through the Rockies, two people wave it down. The driver and an engineer step out and are killed. A group of mercenaries led by computer genius Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) and mercenary leader Penn (McGill) hijack the train. Dane is a satellite programming expert who worked on a top secret satellite laser weapon called \\"Grazer One\\". Dane was fired and faked his death. They herd the passengers and staff into the last two train cars and cut the train's phone lines. Two of Dane's former Department of Defense colleagues are on board the train, hiding their romantic relationship that goes against DoD regulations. Dane has them brought to him and threatens to have one of his mercenaries insert a burning needle into their eye, causing it to explode, unless they give him the codes needed to take over Grazer One. They give him the codes and Dane has them killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane one billion dollars to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer One to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane blows up a Chinese chemical plant in order to demonstrate Grazer One's capabilities to his investors and, after one investor offers an additional 100 million dollars, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife. The US government cannot locate Dane's headquarters and cannot target Grazer One because Dane creates fifty \\"ghost satellites\\" to hide the location of the real Grazer One.

These two talents, both of whom are quite underrated, make \\"Sandra\\" a film that should be seen. Another key element of the film's success is its realism -- there is nothing fake or \\"Hollywood\\" about this set-in-California film. It is truly a slice of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses worn by the character, the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing at her front door, and Sandra sits on the couch without make-up, while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, looking truly as if she just woke up (but nevertheless beautiful), the harmless weirdo Sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra, the one-room apartment into which Sandra moves --all of these elements of the film seem totally real, and as such, the viewer is drawn into Sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class. This film could have easily failed in less competent hands, and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions, but the Garver/Gale team see to it that \\"Sandra\\" is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film.

The Promenade des Anglais The answer is:","output":"Step 1: Establish a clear genre and theme for the movie I will create a movie plot in the genre of a comedy-drama that focuses on the themes of wealth, friendship, and self-discovery. The main premise of the movie will revolve around the location of the Promenade des Anglais, where wealthy people relax and socialize. Step 2: Develop the main characters To create a compelling story, I'll introduce the following main characters: 1.

Claire, a witty, free-spirited woman from a modest background who brings a breath of fresh air to the exclusive world of the Promenade des Anglais. 3. Pierre, Jean's oldest friend and confidant, who continually urges Jean to enjoy the luxurious lifestyle provided by their wealth. Step 3: Outline the movie plot Act 1: - Introduction to the idyllic setting of the Promenade des Anglais, with its stunning sea views and luxurious establishments frequented by the wealthy elite. - Establishing the relationship between Jean and Pierre, longtime friends who enjoy the finer things in life yet harbor an underlying loneliness. - Introducing Claire, who accidentally finds herself in the world of wealthy elites through a mix-up and befriends Jean and Pierre. Act 2: - Showcasing the initial adventures of Jean, Claire, and Pierre as they explore the Promenade des Anglais together, with Claire bringing a unique perspective to their world. - Demonstrating the contrast between the wealthy characters and Claire's humble background, leading Jean to question the significance and worth of material possessions. - Deepening the bond of friendship and emotional connection between Jean and Claire, with Claire helping Jean rediscover the simpler joys in life. Act 3: - A series of conflicts and misunderstandings, as Pierre becomes jealous of Jean and Claire's closeness and goes to great lengths to tear them apart. - Jean and Claire's resilience to these conflicts eventually helps them tackle the boundaries between social classes and prioritize their friendship over wealth. - Ultimately, the trio reconciles, with Pierre learning valuable lessons from his mistakes and Jean embracing a more balanced life. Conclusion: The movie plot reaches a satisfying conclusion as Jean, Claire, and Pierre come together to redefine their priorities and establish deeper connections at the picturesque Promenade des Anglais.

Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications, and as of 2015[update] they remain dominant : IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server are the top DBMS.

Jessica had noticed that Katrina's hands would turn a concerning shade of red whenever they headed out together, coupled with the fact that she would constantly rub them together in an attempt to generate some semblance of warmth. Furthermore, Jessica was aware that Katrina had misplaced her own pair of gloves a week ago, and had been unsuccessful in her search for a replacement that would provide proper insulation for her delicate hands. Kind-hearted and sympathetic, Jessica decided that the best course of action would be to share her own gloves with Katrina, especially since she had a spare set at home. She realized that a simple and caring gesture like this could potentially make a significant difference in ensuring her dear friend's comfort and well-being during this challenging period.

In 1981 Afghanistan, a Soviet tank unit viciously attacks a Pashtun village harboring a group of mujahideen fighters. Following the assault, one of the tanks, commanded by the ruthless Commander Daskal (George Dzundza), gets separated from the unit and enters a blind valley. Taj (Steven Bauer) returns to discover the village destroyed, his father killed and his brother martyred by being crushed under the tank, to serve as execution for disabling and killing a Russian tank crew. As the new khan, following his brother's death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge by his cousin, the opportunistic scavenger Mustafa - and together they lead a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue the separated tank, counting on their captured RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it. The tank's crew is made up of four Soviets and an Afghan communist soldier. As night falls and the crew sets up camp, the Afghan tank crewman Samad (Erick Avari) educates the tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric), about the fundamental principles of Pashtunwali, the Pashtun people's code of honour: milmastia (hospitality), badal (revenge), and nanawatai, which requires even an enemy to be given sanctuary if he asks. As the plot progresses, Commander Daskal (called \\"Tank Boy\\" during World War II for destroying a number of German tanks when he was a child soldier during the Battle of Stalingrad) demonstrates his ruthlessness not only to the enemy, but also to his own men. He despises Samad for his ethnic association to the enemy and, after a couple of attempts to kill him, finally gets his wish on the pretext of suspecting Samad of collaborating with the mujahadeen.

Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a  female employee was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months  later about the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar  cases, courts  subsequently  found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such  complaints. The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is  immaterial. If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double  standard in handling sexual harassment cases.

In the PC plan for growth we call for government to allow Canadians to have more flexibility with their RESP contributions and transfers from their RRSPs, but only as part of a holistic policy toward economic growth, one that combines tax relief, lower income taxes, lower payroll taxes, greater opportunities for jobs and growth in Canada that would keep young people here where they belong. Can we infer the following? They are concerned with young people leaving Canada.","output":"Yes, we can infer that the party behind the PC plan for growth is indeed concerned with young people leaving Canada. This concern is based on multiple aspects of the comprehensive policy proposal that aims to promote economic growth, which includes tax relief, lower income taxes, lower payroll taxes, and greater opportunities for jobs and growth in the country. By emphasizing these measures, the party wants to create an attractive and competitive environment that encourages young Canadians to stay and contribute to Canada's economy, rather than seek opportunities elsewhere. By allowing Canadians to have more flexibility with their RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan) contributions and RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) transfers, the party aims to provide better support for education and retirement savings. These provisions signal an attempt to address the financial challenges faced by young Canadians and their families, which can be a contributing factor for them to seek opportunities outside of Canada. Furthermore, lowering income and payroll taxes can potentially lead to higher disposable income for individuals and businesses. This can result in increased spending, investment, and job creation throughout the economy, making the job market more attractive for young Canadians. A vibrant and growing job market can encourage young people to stay in Canada, pursue careers, and contribute to the country's economic growth. Lastly, by promoting overall economic growth through the mentioned policies, the party aims to create new opportunities and a supportive environment for businesses to grow, invest, and create new jobs. This can effectively contribute to attracting talent, retaining young people, and deterring them from leaving the country in search of better prospects elsewhere. In conclusion, the PC plan for growth, with its focus on tax relief, lower income and payroll taxes, flexible RESP contributions, and RRSP transfers, highlights a definite concern for young people leaving Canada. By proposing these measures, the party aims to foster a strong, competitive, and vibrant economy where young Canadians can access education, jobs, and opportunities to grow, prosper, and contribute to the nation's wealth and progress."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more caterpillars will become pupa happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The life cycle of a butterfly involves several stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). Each of these stages plays a vital role in the development and growth of the butterfly, and any perturbation or change in one stage may have consequences for the other stages and the overall butterfly population. According to the perturbation hypothesis provided, it is assumed that there will be an increase in the number of caterpillars that form into pupae. It is important to analyze the possible direct and indirect effects of such a change in the process.  Possible Direct Effects: 1. Increased Butterfly Population: As more caterpillars successfully transition into the pupa stage and subsequently into adult butterflies, there is a potential for an increase in the overall butterfly population. This may lead to greater biodiversity and pollination activity, which could have positive effects on an ecosystem. 2. Resource Availability and Balance: With an increased number of caterpillars becoming pupae and adult butterflies, there could be strain on the food resources (plants and leaves) that caterpillars feed on. This may result in competition for limited resources and imbalance in the ecosystem, further affecting other species depending on the same resources. Possible Indirect Effects: 1. Predator-Prey Relationship: The increase in butterfly population could also influence the predator-prey relationships in an ecosystem. Predators that feed on caterpillars or butterflies (such as birds, spiders, and other insects) might experience an increase in prey availability, potentially impacting their population numbers as well. 2. Ecological Benefits: Butterfly populations are an important part of many ecosystems, contributing to pollination, providing food for other species, and serving as indicators of environmental health. An increase in butterfly populations could provide a boost to the overall health and wellbeing of an ecosystem. 3. Species Interactions: Enhanced butterfly populations may stimulate more interactions between different butterfly species and other organisms. This could lead to changes in local biodiversity patterns, influencing competition, predation, and mutualism within the ecosystem. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests there will be more caterpillars becoming pupae, which could lead to an increase in butterfly populations. This change may have both direct and indirect effects on an ecosystem. While there could be potential ecological benefits, the strain on resources and shifts in predator-prey relationships underline the need for a balanced ecosystem. Understanding the consequences of such perturbations is crucial for conservation efforts and maintaining overall ecosystem health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Classes can often be heard letting out a collective groan when the teacher mentions homework,  ruining plans for a night watching films or playing out with friends. However, this will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk -  because it has decided to ban all homework. Good news: Homework will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk -  because it has decided to ban it. This picture is posed by models. Instead, the 1100 children who will attend the Jane Austen Academy in Norwich will do longer days at school. The mixed free school for 11-18-year-olds - which will specialise in English and the humanities - is set to open in September 2014. The school yesterday unveiled its prospective principal, Claire Heald, who said that city children would do extra study at school as part of the extended day, which could last until about 5pm. She said: 'Rather than setting homework that pupils could go home and struggle with at home, and where there may be limited access to computers, they will do that as independent study in the day. 'We are saying that when they go home they should enjoy quality family time. 'There will not be any traditional homework - and that has been really well received by parents who respect the fact that family time will be family time.' New approach: The 1100 students who will attend the Jane Austen Academy will do longer days at school. The school's prospective principal, Claire Heald, is pictured. But Ms Heald said the school would still expect youngsters to study at home ahead of crucial exams. She's ready to create a new dramatic template in the UK after French president Francois Hollande called for the end of homework in primary schools last October. The French leader insisted independent learning at school would enhance equality because kids who get help with homework from parents have a huge head start. Since their introduction by the Coalition, dozens of free schools have opened - with many others in the pipeline. But they have proved controversial, with many providing alternative methods of teaching and education. At the Tiger Primary School in Maidstone, pupils have all-singing and all-dancing curriculum. Pupils have specialist teachers for Mandarin, music, gym, dance and games lessons. They also have access to a school farm and ecology woodland. Pupils at the Greenwich Free School in London spend a third more time learning than most school children. The school day lasts from 8am to 5.30pm. There are only 100 pupils in each year, which the school says means teachers get to know each pupil as an individual. The exciting initiative has already sparked keen interest from other headteachers in Norfolk. Peter Devonish, headteacher of Neatherd High School in Dereham, said: 'My initial thought is that it's really compelling. 'It sounds like a really good idea. 'Having the children on site a bit longer to consolidate their learning is a really good idea. 'The children can finish work and they can have their time with the family.' But he warned: 'I have got two stumbling blocks. 'One is our rurality and getting children home at that time, and the other is changing staff contracts so they can be here until 5.30pm. 'If you are a free school you do not have to conform in the same way.' Mr Devonish said they set pupils project-based homework, such as looking at an energy efficient house, which allowed them to combine independent study with working with their parents. Craig Morrison, principal of King's Lynn Academy, agreed that the whole prickly issue of homework should be looked at. Mr Morrison said: 'I can understand why people want to experiment with this because it is one I would not say anybody can say they have got definitively right over the years. 'And if they are starting a new school then it gives them the chance to try out new things.' He added: 'A large problem with homework, which we have tackled, has been that not enough is done with it. 'With homework, a lot of effort can go into it, so it's about celebrating what children do rather than processing it in terms of marking it and handing it back.'","output":"The Jane Austen Academy, a new secondary free school in Norfolk, UK has banned homework for its 1100 students, who will spend longer school days doing independent study.

The review cannot be entirely classified as positive, as there are certain elements they found unsatisfactory. The review begins by acknowledging that the book contains a lot of information, which indicates that the reviewer appreciates the content to some extent. However, their primary concern revolves around the lack of a detailed timeline they were expecting. The reviewer was looking for a comprehensive timeline that spanned the entirety of the Bible, as well as world history to make comparisons between the two. Unfortunately, they found that the book did not deliver on this specific aspect. The reviewer goes on to state that they have come across free online resources that provided more detailed timelines than the one offered in the book. This comparison might suggest that the reviewer may not consider the book to be of great value, as it didn't fulfill their expectations in this area. Moreover, the mention of the fold-out timeline at the beginning of the book seems to be an additional point of dissatisfaction, as they probably found it insufficient. Consequently, it would be reasonable to assume that the reviewer might have wanted a more exhaustive visual representation of the timeline throughout the book.

Which colour was the title of Coldplay's first top 5 hit in 2000 and the flag used in Formula 1 racing to indicate a hazard, slow down and not overtake?","output":"The color that corresponds to both Coldplay's first top 5 hit in 2000 and the flag used in Formula 1 racing to indicate a hazard, slow down, and not overtake is yellow. Coldplay, a British rock band, achieved their first top 5 hit in 2000 with the song \\"Yellow.\\" Released as the second single from their debut album, \\"Parachutes,\\" the song quickly gained popularity and commercial success on the music charts. \\"Yellow\\" showcases Coldplay's early sound, characterized by melodic instrumentation and Chris Martin's emotive vocals. The title \\"Yellow\\" is significant as the lyrics mention stars and their shimmering yellow color, and may symbolize warmth, optimism, and hope. The song was critically acclaimed and helped establish Coldplay as a prominent force in the alternative and indie rock genres. In Formula 1 racing, the yellow flag holds immense importance as a prominent safety feature. This flag signals drivers to slow down, be prepared to change their course, and not overtake other vehicles due to a hazard on the track. The hazard could be anything from an accident, debris, or a stopped car to unfavorable weather conditions that could impact the drivers' ability to race safely. Race marshals use the yellow flag to alert drivers to the presence of these hazards.  A single waved yellow flag indicates that drivers should slow down and be prepared to encounter a hazard, while two waved yellow flags imply that the drivers must slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. Additionally, during a Formula 1 race, yellow flags are accompanied by yellow lights strategically placed along the course to enhance their visibility and ensure that drivers receive the necessary safety information. In summary, yellow is the color that connects the two distinctive areas of Coldplay's early success with their chart-topping song and the critical safety protocol in Formula 1 racing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: whom team is difficult from the outset? Movie title: Saving Mr. Banks Movie plot: The film begins in Australia, 1906. We start in the sky and for a moment, see the shadow of an umbrella in the clouds. The camera goes lower and lower as a weathervane turns to point east and a young girl, Ginty (the real name of P.L. Travers) is seen playing make believe in her front yard. The disembodied voice of Travers Goff says, \\"Winds in the East, mist coming in, like something is brewing, about to begin. Can't put my finger on what lies in store but I feel what's to happen all happened before.\\" This is the same overture that begins \\"Mary Poppins.\\"Now it's the year 1961. Pamela \\"P.L.\\" Travers (Emma Thompson) is a beautiful, sophisticated and smart but also grumpy, stuffy and rather unkind woman living in London. Her home office reveals she has already found success as the author of the Mary Poppins series. The doorbell rings and she finds Diarmiud Russell, her agent. They talk in her living room. She tells him she's cancelled the car because she no longer needs a ride to the airport, having changed her mind about giving up the rights to her story. Diarmuid points out she has a verbal agreement and can be sued but she replies by saying she has no money for him to claim. He confirms this as he reminds her that sales have dried up and there are no more royalties -- and that she has just recently reached terms after 20 years of being pursued -- no animation, script approval. To keep her house, Pamela agrees to venture to Los Angeles to hear the studio out but promises to leave the papers unsigned if she's not happy with their interpretation.In a flashback, we see Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) surprise his daughter, a young Pamela, nicknamed Ginty. He says he's looking for his daughter, the royal princess, and Ginty laughs and reveals it's her. They are obviously close. He puts her on his shoulders and they rush into the park, with him telling her their adventure is about to begin.In current day, Pamela is trying to load a giant bag into the overhead locker.

The movie depicts the story of Pamela \\"P.L.\\" Travers, the author of the Mary Poppins series, and her struggles with the idea of giving up the rights to her story. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis, let us discuss several factors that you should consider before making a decision. 1. Cast and Crew: The film stars Emma Thompson as P.L.Travers and Colin Farrell as Travers Goff, both of whom are critically acclaimed actors with numerous accolades. Their performances would attract audiences and potentially result in a successful film. It would be important to also consider the director, screenwriter, and other key crew members' experience and reputation in the film industry. A proven track record would increase the chances of the film being a success. 2. Budget and Financing: You should analyze the proposed budget for the film, including the costs related to production, marketing, and distribution. A thorough understanding of the financial aspect will help you determine whether the expected return on your investment aligns with your goals. 3. Market Potential: Evaluate the potential market for a film with this storyline. Period dramas often have a niche audience, but the connection to the popular Mary Poppins series could help broaden its appeal. Research similar films in terms of genre, subject matter, and target audience to gauge the potential box-office success and revenue from other sources like streaming or merchandising. 4. Awards and Critical Reception: Awards and positive critical reception can significantly improve a film's box-office performance and longevity. With talents like Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell, there is potential for critical recognition, which can translate into better financial returns. 5.Return on Investment: Based on your research, calculate an estimated return on investment (ROI) and compare it with other potential investment opportunities. This will allow you to determine if investing in the film proposal provides a competitive and satisfactory return on your investment. 6. Personal Interest and Passion: Assess your personal interest in the film's story and the creative vision behind it. Passion is an important aspect to consider when investing in a film, as your involvement may not solely be based on financial gains. In conclusion, to decide whether to invest in the film proposal for \\"Saving Mr. Banks\\", you should thoroughly assess various factors such as the cast and crew, budget, market potential, potential for awards, return on investment, and your personal passion for the project. By conducting proper research and evaluating these aspects, you can make an informed decision about whether or not this is the right investment opportunity for you."},{"instruction":"Question: Information:  - New England is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeast United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.  - A roof is part of a building envelope. It is the covering on the uppermost part of a building or shelter which provides protection from animals and weather, notably rain or snow, but also heat, wind and sunlight. The word also denotes the framing or structure which supports that covering.  - Essex County is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Massachusetts.

Marlborough became a prosperous industrial town in the 19th century and made the transition to high technology industry in the late 20th century after the construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - A chimney is a structure that provides ventilation for hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Chimneys are typically vertical, or as near as possible to vertical, to ensure that the gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney, effect. The space inside a chimney is called a \\"flue\\". Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the United States, the term smokestack (colloquially, stack) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, and the term funnel can also be used.  - The Massachusetts Turnpike (locally called the Mass Pike or the Pike) is a toll road in Massachusetts, maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). Spanning , the highway constitutes the easternmost portion of Interstate 90 (I-90); it begins near Logan International Airport at the eastern border of Boston and becomes part of the New York State Thruway at the Berkshire Connector in Canaan, New York, where I-90 continues towards its western terminus in Seattle, Washington. The turnpike traverses the state, and connects Boston with the major cities of Springfield and Worcester.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population.

A saltbox has just one story in the back and two stories in the front. The flat front and central chimney are recognizable features, but the asymmetry of the unequal sides and the long, low rear roof line are the most distinctive features of a saltbox, which takes its name from its resemblance to a wooden lidded box in which salt was once kept.

The statement doesn't provide enough information to make any conclusions or assumptions about the child's position post-jump.

Pick from: * negative; * positive;","output":"The sentiment of this tweet is negative. In order to understand the sentiment, let's break down the tweet for a comprehensive analysis. The user is addressing their tweet to another user named 'MichelleAzure'. The content of the tweet includes \\"I wish you would go STFU one day.\\" Here, 'STFU' is an internet slang term that stands for 'shut the (expletive) up', a harsh phrase that connotes anger or irritation. The user is expressing a strong wish for MichelleAzure to stop talking or expressing herself, which is a negative sentiment. Primarily, sentiment analysis identifies the mood or subjective emotions within the text, whether positive, negative, or neutral. The emotional cues are derived from the language and context used in the text. In this case, the language usage and expression explicitly depict a negative sentiment. This tweet does not express joy, satisfaction, or any positive emotions towards the user MichelleAzure. Instead, it communicates annoyance, dissatisfaction, and distaste. The tweet is confrontational, with an apparent desire for MichelleAzure to silence her opinions or views. Such a manner of direct, vehement expression denotes a negative sentiment as it lacks any positive or even neutral tonality. Furthermore, understanding and interpreting the sentiment in a tweet, or any piece of online user-generated content for that matter, involves considering various contextual factors. These include sarcasm, irony, the user's prior tweet history, the overall conversation's theme, etc. However, based on this single tweet alone, the sentiment unmistakably comes across as negative. Predicting the sentiment of this tweet as negative is based on the text's overall tone, the harsh abbreviation used, and the sentiments that such a phrase would usually denote in an online communication context. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the sentiment of this tweet in question is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \\"double\\" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \\"single\\", with the topcoat only. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the more common coat for dogs from colder climates?","output":"The more common coat type for dogs from colder climates is the \\"double coat.\\" This type of coat is specially adapted to provide dogs with insulation and protection from harsh weather conditions often associated with cold climates. It is made up of two layers: the guard hair and the soft down hair.  The guard hair, also known as the outer coat or topcoat, primarily provides protection. It is made up of longer, coarser, and water-resistant hairs that help shield the dog from rain, snow, and other environmental conditions. The guard hairs also help to wick away moisture and protect the dog's skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. The soft down hair, also known as the undercoat or inner coat, is the insulating layer in a double coat. It is made up of short, soft, and dense hairs which work together to trap warm air close to the dog's body, thus effectively maintaining body heat. The undercoat acts as a thermal layer, providing warmth during winter and serving as a cooling barrier during the summer by allowing air circulation close to the skin.  Dogs from colder climates, such as Arctic regions or high-altitude environments, have developed these double coats through natural selection. As a result, they have a better chance of survival and thriving in these challenging conditions. Some examples of breeds with double coats originating from cold climates include Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and Samoyeds. In summary, the more common coat type for dogs from colder climates is a double coat which provides them with both protection and insulation, making them well-adapted to surviving and thriving in harsh weather conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Especially if you are in a household with children — who are prone to frequent cuts and abrasions while playing — it can be helpful to have some supplies in the house that are \\"easy-access\\" for when an injury does occur. These can be purchased over-the-counter at any drugstore or pharmacy, and are described in more detail in the steps below. Either iodine or hydrogen peroxide is effective as an antiseptic — meaning they work to reduce the likelihood of infection in a wound.  Do not rub the area too hard when applying the antiseptic, as this may further the injury or cause irritation to the wound. Gently applying it is all that is required.   Use a cotton ball to apply the antiseptic to the wound surface; this is because the cotton ball is clean, so it will not further contaminate the wound, as opposed to using your hand. Note that hydrogen peroxide is the most commonly used antiseptic, and it can be purchased at any drug store or pharmacy. Antibiotic creams or ointments, such as Neosporin or Triple Antibiotic, can be applied directly over the cut, and then covered by a Band-Aid. These greatly diminish the possibility of bacterial infection of the cut or abrasion. These have been shown to boost the immune system and to increase speed of healing.  Examples include gently rubbing aloe vera, honey, or lavender oil on the wound, and then covering it with a bandage.","output":"The article highlights the importance of having easy-access antiseptic supplies like iodine or hydrogen peroxide for treating wounds, and suggests using antibiotic creams, bandages, and natural remedies to prevent infection and promote healing in households with children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In late 2006, Aneta Krawczyk accused the party's leader Andrzej Lepper of having offered her political favours for sex in 2001, and then said he had been the father of her youngest child. She said the same of Lepper's close collaborator and MP, Stanislaw Lyzwinski, and accused him of rape and sexual abuse. She also said that Popecki, who had been Lyzwinski's aide, had tried to induce a miscarriage by giving her a labour-inducing drug called oxytocin. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Lyzwinski's aide had tried to create a miscarriage.","output":"Based on the information presented in the paragraph, the statement \\"Lyzwinski's aide had tried to create a miscarriage\\" seems to be true. According to the accusations of Aneta Krawczyk, Popecki, an individual identified as Lyzwinski's aide, had given her a labor-inducing drug called oxytocin. It is well known that oxytocin could stimulate uterine contractions, and in some cases, it could potentially cause miscarriage if administered during pregnancy. Given this, it seems appropriate to interpret Krawczyk's accusation as implying that Popecki, in his role as Lyzwinski's aide, attempted to induce a miscarriage. However, it should be pointed out that this interpretation is based solely on the information given, which is based on the accusations of Aneta Krawczyk. In real-life contexts, such a serious allegation would typically be subject to legal scrutiny and would require corroborating evidence to be proven true. If substantiated, this would constitute a serious crime and ethical breach. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention that while we are drawing these conclusions, we understand that they are based on accusations and claims and should be treated as such. It is crucial that such allegations need robust investigation and legal dissection before we can categorically state them as facts, as anyone accused of a crime is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Lastly, these types of allegations have significant social and political implications. They can potentially damage the reputation of involved individuals and political entities, and often underscore the need for ethical conduct and transparency in political and interpersonal engagements. What this story essentially highlights is an alleged incident of misuse of power for personal and political gains, as well as potential sexual exploitation, adding to an often-decried culture of impunity in some political circles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Five years ago when I was in Junior Grade One, I got interested in bicycling because I thought my uncle was very cool when he rode his bike. He could ride a bike with only one wheel. He could also sit on the bike and keep it standing straight, without moving for a long time. I thought it was easy to learn to ride a bike, so I decided to learn from my uncle. He told me how to ride. When I fell off the bike the first time, I was afraid to try again. It was too hard for me to learn. Then my uncle helped me by holding the bike for me and not to let go.

They were released after a night in custody. But her passport was withheld. Her arrest comes amid a crackdown on human rights activists and journalists in the oil-rich ex-Soviet state.

Mrs Yunus had been pressing for reconciliation between Azerbaijan and its next-door neighbour and bitter rival Armenia.

Mrs Yunus predicted last week that she faced imminent arrest. On Tuesday morning, after her overnight detention, she was taken back to her home but refused to let police search it without a warrant. Amid the tension her husband fell ill and was taken to hospital. Doctors told the BBC Azeri service he had suffered from hypertension and was stable. Mrs Yunus told journalists outside her house that during her 11-hour detention she was not allowed to use the toilet, and when finally allowed to go it was only in the presence of a male police officer. \\"It's like torture, like the Middle Ages,\\" she said.  \\"I haven't slept for a whole day.\\" She was later released, but her office was searched.

Question: Why does Nelson submit to Barry at first? Movie title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Let's Go to Prison\\", Nelson Biederman IV submits to Barry at first primarily due to a combination of fear, vulnerability, and the need for protection in a new and dangerous environment. As the son of a judge, Nelson IV comes from a privileged background and has led a sheltered life, which makes him ill-equipped to deal with the harsh realities of prison. Once Nelson IV ends up in prison, he finds himself in a whole new world where the rules are different, and he is forced to adapt quickly to survive. This is where John Lyshitski, who has a personal vendetta against the Biederman family, takes advantage of Nelson's vulnerability, pretending to be his friend but secretly trying to ruin his life even further. When Nelson IV meets Barry, the imposing yet charismatic gang leader, he recognizes that Barry is both feared and respected by other inmates, and he sees an opportunity for protection and potential guidance. Barry's strength and the influence he has over other prisoners make him a powerful ally in the treacherous environment Nelson finds himself in. Nelson IV comes to the realization that to survive in prison, he will need to rely on others to navigate it successfully, even if it means submitting to the power dynamics of this new world. Additionally, as Nelson IV discovers his homosexuality and develops a romantic relationship with Barry, his submission is not just an act of self-preservation but also a natural consequence of his newfound love and intimacy with Barry. The relationship between Nelson and Barry evolves from one based on necessity to a genuine attachment, providing both emotional and physical support for Nelson as he tries to acclimate to life in prison. In conclusion, Nelson Biederman IV submits to Barry initially due to his overwhelming fear of the unknown world of prison, his vulnerability resulting from his privileged background, and his desperation to find protection in a dangerous environment. Moreover, the development of a romantic relationship with Barry further solidifies Nelson's willingness to submit to him as a means of emotional and physical support. Throughout the story, this submission represents a coping mechanism for Nelson IV to navigate the harsh realities of life in prison while slowly finding his footing and ultimately learning how to survive."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The app's voice-guided navigation feels natural and is relatively easy to use. The gestures are straightforward, making it simple to open menus and access various functions. It's clear that the developers put a lot of effort into ensuring that this app caters to the needs of its target audience. The integration with other Google apps is seamless, allowing me to use Gmail, Maps, and Chrome effortlessly. However, there is some room for improvement.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.  Question: \\"What kind of vessels in the skin dilate to help cool the body?\\" Answer: \\"Plastic vessels\\" Is this answer correct? Choices:  a). no.  b). yes....I think the answer is","output":"a). no. The correct answer is \\"no,\\" because plastic vessels are not a part of the human body's vascular system. The question refers to blood vessels in the skin. Blood vessels, specifically capillaries and arterioles, are responsible for dilation and constriction to regulate body temperature. When the body needs to cool down, the blood vessels close to the skin's surface dilate, allowing for increased blood flow and heat to be released. Plastic vessels are not involved in this process, making this answer incorrect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Multi-choice question: What is the sentiment of the following tweet? Tweet: Phones pretty much dying permanently. Gas was stolen and spent the last bit of money on re ride home. Empty tank, I want to see my lovess  Options: * negative * positive","output":"The sentiment of this tweet is negative.  To assess the sentiment of a piece of text, we need to analyze the context, the emotions expressed, and the specific words used. In this case, the context of the tweet highlights a series of unfortunate events experienced by the user. Let's break it down: 1. The user starts by mentioning that their phone is almost dead, mentioning that it is \\"pretty much dying permanently.\\" This statement has negative implications, as the loss of phone functionality can cause inconvenience or even anxiety for the user. 2. The user then talks about their gas being stolen, which is another negative event. The theft of personal property is almost universally considered a negative experience. In this case, it not only corresponds to a significant financial loss but also adds stress to the user's life. 3. The user says they spent their last bit of money on a ride home, which suggests financial hardship and a lack of resources. This again is a negative circumstance, as it underscores the user's dire situation and further elevates their stress levels. 4. The user mentions having an empty gas tank, highlighting that they cannot use their own vehicle. This statement reinforces the negative sentiment because it adds a layer of inconvenience and frustration to their current situation. 5. Finally, the user expresses a desire to see their \\"lovess,\\" which may refer to loved ones or significant others. While the longing to see loved ones might be considered positive in a different context, in this tweet, it adds to the negative sentiment because it underscores the user's inability to fulfill their emotional needs due to the difficulties they face. Considering these factors, it is clear that the sentiment of the tweet is negative. The user's choice of words and the context in which they are used convey disappointment, stress, and frustration, making it evident that the user is undergoing a series of adverse events that have negatively impacted their overall emotional state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) is a line of home/personal computers produced starting in 1977 by Commodore International. A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.  - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory.  - A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it.  - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Better Dead Than Alien is a shoot ' em up game similar to Space Invaders published in 1988 for 16 - bit main platforms and Commodore 64 by Electra in its first release . The player takes control of hero Brad Zoom 's ship in his quest to save civilization from aliens . The game is full of humor and the intro screen is in magazine style .  - Shoot 'em up (also known as shmup or STG) is a subgenre of the shooter genre of video games. In a shoot 'em up, the player character engages in a lone assault, often in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up. Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives. Shoot 'em ups call for fast reactions and for the player to memorize levels and enemy attack patterns. \\"Bullet hell\\" games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles.  - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon.    What is the relationship between 'better dead than alien' and 'amiga'? A:","output":"\\"Better Dead Than Alien\\" is a video game that was developed for various platforms, and one of such platforms included the Commodore Amiga. The Commodore Amiga, often referred to as simply \\"Amiga,\\" is a product of Commodore International, a company that played a significant role in the home/personal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s.  \\"Better Dead Than Alien\\" is a shoot 'em up game that is reminiscent of the classic game Space Invaders and follows the protagonist's, Brad Zoom's, journey to save civilization from aliens. In this game genre, the player character is often involved in a solitary assault, which often takes place in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting a large number of enemies while evading their attacks. In the case of \\"Better Dead Than Alien,\\" the player assumes control of Brad Zoom's spaceship. The Amiga was a significant platform for the release of various games, including \\"Better Dead Than Alien\\", because of its advanced graphics and sound capabilities, which were superior to many other systems at the time. The game developers leveraged the high-definition color, superior sound, and graphic specs of the Amiga to deliver a more engaging gaming experience. The Amiga's ability to deliver high-quality graphics and sound was due to its unique architecture, which included dedicated coprocessors for handling tasks such as audio, graphics, and direct memory access (DMA) transfers. In addition to showcasing the advanced technological capabilities of the Amiga, \\"Better Dead Than Alien\\" and similar games contributed to the platform's popularity and commercial success. Many successful and popular games were released for the Amiga during the 1980s and 1990s, thus establishing it as a key console in the video game industry of that era.

He is usually portrayed as a warrior with superhuman abilities and a master of disguise possessed of magical powers. Cu Roi further appears in the episode known as \\"The Trance of Amairgin\\", variants of which appear in Recension I and II of the Tain bo Cuailnge.  The episode appears as Aislinge n-Aimirgin (\\"The trance of Amairgin\\") in Recension I of the Tain. Having followed news of Cu Chulainn's sustained success in single-handedly opposing the Connacht army, Cu Roi once again appears on the scene, this time to fight Cu Chulainn directly. However, on finding Cu Chulainn weak from the injuries which Ferdiad had recently inflicted on him, he refused to carry out his original plan. Instead he faces the giant warrior poet Amairgin, who in a trance is hurling stones at the Connacht army in Tailtiu, with devastating effects. Cu Roi attacks him in kind and their stones meet in the air. They pause when on Cu Roi's request, Amairgen allows the cattle to go past Tailtiu, but seeing as the passage had become difficult, Cu Roi agrees to withdraw from the contest altogether.  The episode in the Book of Leinster (Recension II), called Imthusa Chon Rui meic Daire (header) or Oislige Amargin (text), offers by and large the same story, but adds more explicit detail, notably on the point of Cu Roi's sense of honour in his encounters with Cu Chulainn and Amairgin. First, Cu Roi explains his refusal to fight Cu Chulainn not only by pointing out the inequality between a physically healthy and an injured warrior, but also by saying that a victory would not be his, seeing as it was Fer Diad who had laid low his opponent. Second, the conclusion of Cu Roi's fight with Amairgin is told from a perspective which highlights the role of honour in his motives. Medb insisted \\"[b]y the truth of your [Cu Roi's] valour\\" ([a]r fir do gascid fritt) that he should abandon the competition, obstructive as it proved to be to the progress of the expedition. Cu Roi, however, was determined to persist \\"till the day of doom\\" (co brunni bratha) unless Amairgin agreed to stop.

In this episode, Cu Roi encounters the giant warrior poet Amairgin, who has fallen into a trance and is hurling stones at the Connacht army in Tailtiu, causing significant damage.  Cu Roi, initially intending to fight Cu Chulainn, decides against it on finding him injured. Instead, he engages in a battle with Amairgin by launching stones at him, and their stones clash in mid-air. They come to a temporary pause when Amairgin allows the cattle to pass by Tailtiu. Due to the challenging passage and Cu Roi's sense of honor, as well as Medb's insistence based on his valour, Cu Roi agrees to withdraw from the contest altogether. Cu Roi's honor is further emphasized in this episode when he opts not to fight Cu Chulainn, insisting that a victory would not be rightfully his since Fer Diad had already injured Cu Chulainn."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Such programs usually cater to children from infancy until they enter formal schooling and can sometimes be extended to cover out-of-school or after-school care for school-aged children. The primary goals of these programs are to provide a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment for children while their parents or guardians are at work or engaged in other obligations. Learning and childcare services are often essential for working families who need a reliable and secure place for their children to stay during working hours. These programs can vary in their educational approach, with some focusing on a structured curriculum, while others emphasize play-based learning or a combination of both. Some key components of these programs may include: 1. Early childhood education: These programs are designed to support the development of cognitive, social, emotional, and physical skills in young children. Early childhood education can be provided in various settings, such as preschools, kindergartens, and childcare centers. 2. Daycare services: Daycare centers offer childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, providing a safe and nurturing environment for children while their parents are at work. These centers may offer a mix of educational, play-based, and recreational activities to support the overall development of the child. 3. After-school care: This type of program provides care, supervision, and enrichment opportunities for school-aged children during the hours immediately following the end of the school day. After-school care programs may include educational support, recreational activities, and socialization opportunities. 4. Special needs services: Some programs cater to children with special needs, providing individualized support and targeted interventions to help them reach their full potential. These programs may include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy, among other specialized services. 5. Parent engagement and support: Many learning and childcare programs also include resources and support for parents, such as parent education workshops, resources for at-home learning, and opportunities for parental involvement in the program's activities. In summary, programs offering learning and childcare services play a crucial role in supporting families, offering a safe and nurturing environment for children to grow and develop their skills, and helping prepare them for success in school and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt - Become magma again.  Question: suppose sediment becomes a smaller rock happens, how will it affect MORE igneous rock forming.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"C: no effect The process you described outlines the rock cycle, which explains how rocks transform between different types (igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic). In the scenario you provided, sediment becoming a smaller rock (sedimentary rock) will not directly affect the formation of more igneous rocks. Igneous rocks form when magma from a volcano cools and solidifies. The formation of sedimentary rocks, which occurs when sediments accumulate and undergo compaction and cementation, is a separate process that does not influence the cooling of magma or the solidification process. Therefore, the formation of more sedimentary rocks will have no direct effect on the formation of more igneous rocks. However, it is important to note that the rock cycle can involve multiple complex processes and interactions between different types of rocks. For example, if the sedimentary rocks mentioned in your scenario were eventually subjected to high pressures and temperatures due to tectonic forces, they could become metamorphic rocks, which could then melt and turn into magma, leading to the formation of igneous rocks under the right conditions. In that case, there would be more igneous rocks formed as a result of the complete rock cycle process, but the direct change from sediment to smaller sedimentary rocks would still not have a direct effect on igneous rock formation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Last week, singer Susan Boyle, 52, revealed she was diagnosed with Asperger's a year ago. When. Annette Lewn's children were young, she longed to join in the chats. with other mothers at toddler group coffee mornings, but always felt. like an outsider. 'I desperately wanted to be part of the group, but I. never seemed to say the right thing and I'd get funny looks from. people,' says Annette, 42, a school cleaner who lives in Chippenham,. Wiltshire, with her son Ryan, 15, and daughter Rachel, 14. 'I just don't. pick up on social niceties at all,' she adds. Annette has often. been criticised for being rude or blunt, although she never intends to. be, and the criticism upsets her greatly. 'When I was a teenager I. remember a friend asking me what I thought of her new make-up. She. obviously thought she looked great, but I said she looked like she'd. upset a paint box all over her face. Everyone else just stared at me in. disbelief.' Annette had friends 'but found the reality of having to make conversation stressful, and I'd long to go home and be alone'. Meanwhile, teachers would scold her for not making eye contact. 'I. could mask my personality traits by copying the behaviour of others,. but I just didn't pick up the cues for what was appropriate; it required. huge effort,' recalls Annette. As well as her lack of social skills, Annette's hobbies set her apart. While most of her. friends plastered their walls with pop star posters, she was obsessed. with maps, and stuck her collection of 30 or so all around her bed. Then,. five years ago in her late 30s, Annette discovered the cause of her. quirky behaviour traits. She has Asperger's syndrome, sometimes referred. to as a 'mild' form of autism. Autism is a spectrum disorder. affecting how a person makes sense of the world, processes information. and relates to other people. At one end of the spectrum, some with. Asperger's can often hold down jobs, marry and - on the surface, at. least - live a normal life. But their symptoms can still cause a lot of. distress, with problems in relationships and at school and work. There. are around 700,000 people on the autism spectrum in Britain, according. to The National Autistic Society, with more being diagnosed. Asperger's. is much more common in men, although experts are beginning to wonder if. this is simply because the symptoms are harder to recognise in women. Annette Lewns, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, has also been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Last week, singer Susan Boyle, 52, revealed she was diagnosed with Asperger's a year ago. For. years she'd thought her difficulties - she was nicknamed 'Susie Simple' at school - had been caused by complications at birth. She'd also. suffered from anxiety around strangers and struggled with eye contact,. making her feel 'different' and 'an outsider' throughout her childhood. In fact, these were signs of Asperger's. 'Many people with. Asperger's want to be sociable, but have difficulties making friends and. struggle to maintain them,' explains Dr Judith Gould, of the National. Autistic Society. 'They don't understand the unwritten social rules. and can appear aloof or behave inappropriately. This can make them. depressed and cause them to withdraw.' The condition is 'particularly. difficult' to diagnose in females because they are much better at. masking their symptoms than males, says Dr Gould. 'They know they are. different, but still want to fit in and make friends, and so will learn. how to \\"act\\" in social situations. Men can do this, too, but they don't. care as much about fitting in and don't tend to need to be as sociable. as women. 'Girls also tend to be more passive than boys with. Asperger's, who are usually more aggressive. Consequently, it's easier. to detect it in boys. 'The strain of trying to work out how to behave. and interact can make women anxious, and this can often be misdiagnosed. as depression or they will develop an eating disorder. They may obsess. about counting every calorie, for example, or how much exercise they can. do.' Developing obsessional interests is another common Asperger's trait. 'Girls. might, for instance, develop an obsession with a celebrity, a soap. opera, horses or Barbie dolls,' says Dr Gould. 'What will stand out,. though, is the intensity of that interest or the rituals of how their. collections will be displayed. Perfectionism is another common trait. And a love of strict routines.'What causes it is not clear, though. research using MRI brain scans has shown differences in specific areas. of the brains of children who have Asperger's, including the frontal. lobe which controls our ability to control and moderate our behaviour. The condition is 'more difficult' to diagnose in females because they are much better at masking symptoms. Asperger's. was formally recognised by the World Health Organisation as a distinct. condition only in 1994. Therefore, many adults, such as Susan Boyle and. Annette, are only just now getting a diagnosis. 'There are various. red flags that an experienced clinician will pick up on, such as a lack. of interest in people in childhood,' says Dr Gould. Most of those. with Asperger's have average or above-average intelligence. But. typically, girls with Asperger's will underachieve at school unless a. teacher nurtures them, says Dr Gould. 'They have intelligence, but not. social intelligence: they don't pick up on the whole picture. 'Many. will go on to struggle in a work situation because, although they can. focus on the job, they can't do the social chit-chat which can help them. fit in and get on.' After leaving school Annette worked at a care. home, and although she loved the routine, she found getting on with her. colleagues difficult. 'It baffled me - I just didn't know what I was. doing wrong,' she says. 'I knew I was different, but I just thought it. was my fault and that I wasn't the popular type.' In her 20s Annette met her husband Russell, a firefighter, now 44 (the couple have since separated). 'He carried me in social situations. I felt safe with him,' says Annette. 'I still struggled with female friendships, though.' Then, when their son Ryan was three-and-a-half years old, he was diagnosed with Asperger's.'Luckily,. I never had a problem bonding with the children,' says Annette. 'But. before Ryan's diagnosis, I had wondered if his behaviour was my fault. I. even went to parenting classes.' After their daughter Rachel's. diagnosis at the age of nine, Annette wondered if she herself had it,. too, as Rachel's behaviour was so similar to her own. 'I started. doing more research and took an online diagnosis test for Asperger's and. scored quite high,' says Annette. 'It was a wake-up call. 'My GP. said there was no point getting a diagnosis, but I knew through my. experience with my children that the right support can make a. difference. I was eventually diagnosed in 2011, but only after being. referred to a psychiatrist for depression by my GP. 'It was a great relief to finally find out why I'd always felt like an outsider.' Tom. Madders, head of campaigns at the National Autistic Society, says the. problem is that the condition is often not spotted. He adds: 'Only 63 of. 152 local authorities have a diagnostic pathway in place - a set route. for GPs to refer on to a specialist so people with suspected Asperger's. can be assessed.' Once the condition is diagnosed, the charity runs. courses on social skills, a befriending scheme as well as providing. information on employment and other training. Since Annette's. diagnosis, she has completed a maths qualification, taken a cognitive. behavioural therapy course to help with her anxiety and now works as a. volunteer mentor in a school. 'My confidence has improved and I can. finally explain to people why I might come across the way I do,' explains Annette. 'I'd love to work in education - and I think with. support I could study for qualifications. 'All we \\"Aspies\\" need is some extra help with our social skills.'

They both were diagnosed with something called Asperger's syndrome, which is a type of autism. Autism is when a person's brain works a little differently, especially in how they connect with other people. Annette struggled with making conversation, understanding social rules, and sometimes said things that seemed rude, though she didn’t mean them to be. She was also very interested in things other people didn't care as much about, like maps. This made her feel like she didn't quite fit in. Then, as an adult, she learned that all these things were because she had Asperger's syndrome. It helped her understand why she'd always felt so different and she even started helping others in a school after this discovery. Susan Boyle, the singer, found out she had Asperger's too, when she was 51 years old. Before that, people thought she was just simple or shy because she struggled with making eye contact and felt like an outsider.  They say girls with Asperger's might be better at hiding their signs, so it's harder to spot compared to boys. Also, the things they become intensely interested in could look like typical girl interests - like a celebrity, or Barbie.

Which formerly called \\"Fright Night\\" event at Universal Studios featured the Nick Everhart film, Slash-in-the-Box? A:","output":"A: The event that was formerly called \\"Fright Night\\" at Universal Studios and featured the Nick Everhart film, Slash-in-the-Box, is Halloween Horror Nights. Halloween Horror Nights is an annual special event held at Universal Studios theme parks in Orlando, Hollywood, Singapore, and Japan. The event started back in 1991 under the name \\"Fright Nights,\\" and from 1992 onward, it became known as Halloween Horror Nights. Slash-in-the-Box, directed by Nick Everhart, was showcased during the Halloween Horror Nights event in 2011. In that year, the event was called \\"Halloween Horror Nights 21: No One Beats the House\\" at the Orlando location. This was the 21st edition of the annual event, which brought special attractions connected to the horror genres - haunted houses, scare zones, live shows, and more. In Halloween Horror Nights 21, Universal Orlando created an all-new storyline revolving around a sinister figure known as Lady Luck. Lady Luck acted as a force of misfortune that enticed people to take risks, ultimately leading to terrible consequences. Throughout the event, guests would encounter iconic horror characters, terrifying new faces, and a blend of interactive experiences, evoking fear and excitement at every step. Nick Everhart's Slash-in-the-Box is a short horror film that was integrated into the event, resonating with the theme. It tells the story of a young couple who opens an eerie, old jack-in-the-box toy that unexpectedly unleashes a terrifying surprise. The film played a role in crafting the immersive atmosphere of the event, contributing to the overall horror experience. Thus, the formerly called \\"Fright Night\\" event at Universal Studios that featured the Nick Everhart film, Slash-in-the-Box, is Halloween Horror Nights, specifically during its 2011 edition titled \\"Halloween Horror Nights 21: No One Beats the House\\" at Universal Orlando."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the \\"5 second rule\\" --- the belief about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped. The study, undertaken by final year Biology students and led by Anthony Hilton, Professor of Microbiology at Aston University, monitored the transfer of the common bacteria from a variety of indoor flooring types (carpet, cement floor etc.) to toast, pasta, a biscuit and a sticky sweet when contact was made from 3 to 30 seconds. The results showed that: Time is a significant factor in the transfer of bacteria from a floor surface to a piece of food; and the type of flooring the food has been dropped on has an effect, with bacteria least likely to transfer from carpeted surfaces and most likely to transfer from cement flooring surfaces to moist  foods making contact for more than 5 seconds. Professor Hilton said: \\"Consuming food dropped on the floor still carries an infection risk as it very much depends on which bacteria are present on the floor at the time.\\" The Aston team also carried out a survey of the number of people who employ the 5 second rule. The survey showed that: 87% of people surveyed said they would eat food dropped on the floor, or already have done so. 55% of those who would eat or have eaten food dropped on the floor are women. 81% of the women who would eat food from the floor would follow the 5 second rule.

Second question: Why do silver ions kill bacteria? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"Firstly, let's clarify that colloidal silver and silver ions are indeed related but they are distinct entities. Colloidal silver is a suspension of submicroscopic silver particles in a colloidal base (often water), which can deliver silver ions, but they're not the same thing. So, these two questions, while related, are not the same. First question: How does colloidal silver kill bacteria? Colloidal silver's potent antimicrobial properties are largely attributable to the silver particles it contains. When colloidal silver enters the body, it comes into contact with the body's fluids, which enables the silver ions to detach from the particles. It is these silver ions that possess the antimicrobial potency. When silver ions come into contact with bacterial cells, they can damage the cell membranes, rendering them more permeable. More notably, they're capable of interacting with the cell's DNA and proteins. Silver ions attach to the bacterial cell and penetrate it, leading to the formation of a bond between the silver ion and bacterial DNA. This bond prevents the DNA from unwinding, a crucial step necessary for it to replicate and multiply. Silver ions also interact with the sulfhydryl (-SH) groups present in certain enzymes needed by bacteria for their metabolism. The silver ions react with these groups, leading to their deactivation. This inactivation of essential bacteria enzymes interferes with the bacteria's energy production processes and other crucial biochemical processes, resulting in the death of bacterial cells. Second question: Why do silver ions kill bacteria? As mentioned earlier, the antimicrobial effects of silver ions come from their interaction with bacterial cells at multiple levels. First, silver ions can rupture bacterial cell walls and membranes. The ions destroy the structural integrity of these cells damaging their proteins, resulting in leakage of cell contents and ultimately, cell death. Second, silver ions can penetrate bacterial cells and interfere with their metabolic processes. They react with specific proteins and enzymes required for the bacteria's metabolic activities, disabling their function thereby disrupting the energy production and various other necessary activities for bacterial survival. Last, and most critically, silver ions can interact with bacterial DNA. Upon penetration into the bacterial cell, they bind to the DNA and inhibit its replication by preventing it from unwinding. Without the ability to replicate, bacteria cannot multiply and maintain their population, leading to their eventual dwindling and extermination. So, while both questions are about the antibacterial properties of silver, they are not the same. The first is about the mechanism by which colloidal silver—which contains silver particles—kills bacteria. In contrast, the second is specifically about how silver ions, which are one component of colloidal silver but can also be derived from other sources of silver, kill bacteria. Both mechanisms involve a similar sequence of interactions between silver and bacterial cells but are not identical in the specifics of those interactions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That all-important \\"one more thing\\" from Apple's software presentation is part of the iCloud Web application and storage suite. It was a coup of sorts -- and Apple's win over competitors could be attributed to Jobs' experience at Pixar Animation Studios, which he co-founded. Here's what Apple pulled off: With a free iCloud account, all songs purchased from iTunes can be accessed from any Apple gadget or computer with iTunes installed. (Amazon has done something similar with Cloud Drive.) For 25 a year, iTunes in the Cloud stores a maximum of 25,000 songs on Apple's servers, ready to access from various gizmos. And, importantly, Apple did this with the blessing of the music industry. Amazon and Google, on the other hand, couldn't get the record labels to agree to their terms. Cloud Drive and Google's Music Beta require users to upload every single track to their servers, a process that can take hours or days. Apple, the largest music retailer, somehow managed to convince the labels and publishers to go along with its plan to use a scan-and-match process. iTunes Match looks at the user's music library and grants the keys to high-quality versions of those songs. It uses a don't-ask-don't-tell policy: Napster who? How did Apple pull off something Amazon and Google couldn't, despite them launching cloud-music services first? For one, Apple has a history with the music industry as long as any technology company's. \\"It's really hard to get the labels to give you the rights that you need,\\" Jobs said in a 2003 interview at the first All Things Digital conference. \\"And I don't see them sprinkling those rights around everywhere, letting a thousand flowers grow quite yet.\\" In that interview eight years ago, Jobs described the vast divide between technology and entertainment executives, and he talked about how he bridged it. \\"One of the things I learned at Pixar is the technology industries and the content industries do not understand each other,\\" he said. \\"In Silicon Valley and at most technology companies, I swear that most people still think the creative process is a bunch of guys in their early 30s, sitting on a couch, drinking beer and thinking of jokes. No, they really do. That's how television is made, they think; that's how movies are made.\\" Likewise, record executives can't relate to technical people, Jobs said. \\"People in Hollywood and in the content industries, they think technology is something you just write a check for and buy,\\" Jobs said. \\"They don't understand the creative element of technology. \\"These are like ships passing in the night,\\" the Apple co-founder added. Music execs also may have seen Google as an enemy because its search engine is a popular place to find websites serving pirated albums, according to an article in the Hollywood Reporter. For the ribbon-cutting of the iTunes Store in 2003, Apple broke through the barriers with a list of predictions, Jobs said. Apple executives provided the record labels with a glimpse into their crystal ball, and nine months later, Jobs' team was getting calls from the music companies, he said. \\"The record companies, the most important thing they do is not distribute music,\\" Jobs said. \\"It's picking which of 500 people are going to be the next Sheryl Crow. That's what they do. And some of them do it quite well. And it's an intuitive process. There's not enough data.\\" (Hey, Sheryl Crow, remember her?) \\"It's not surprising that they didn't understand Napster,\\" Jobs said. \\"It's not surprising that they didn't understand that distributing their content over the Internet was the next big wave.\\" Because technology companies treat record labels like clearing houses for content, Silicon Valley bigwigs have trouble getting through the door, Jobs suggested. So it was perhaps Jobs' expertise from Pixar, during his exodus period from Apple, that has given him the edge to secure risky deals with entertainment giants first. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"So, this article is about Apple's iTunes Match service. It's a way for people to store their music in iCloud, which is like a big digital shelf in the sky. When they use iTunes Match, their songs are stored in a special place where they can listen to them anytime on different gadgets, like phones and computers. Apple was able to make this work because Steve Jobs, who used to be in charge of Apple, was also part of a movie-making company called Pixar. He learned how to talk to the people who make music and movies, and he was able to get their permission to use their songs in iTunes Match. What makes this surprising is that other companies like Amazon and Google tried to do something similar, but they couldn't get the same permission from the music-makers. Steve Jobs believed that understanding both technology and creativity made Apple stand out and helped them make deals that other companies couldn't."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: The text mentions that the narrator is heading to Sierra Nevada, which is a mountain range, hence why option c 'They are in a mountainous region' is the correct answer. Option a, 'They are in a tranquil forest', might be assumed by the mention of 'camping trip' and 'campground', however, it is not explicitly mentioned that they are in a forest. Option b, 'They are in Las Vegas, Nevada', is incorrect because even though the narrator is going to Sierra Nevada, Sierra Nevada and Las Vegas are not the same places. Las Vegas is a city and Sierra Nevada is a mountain range, both in Nevada but that doesn't make them the same.

Answer choices: - wind  - gravity  - density  - volume  - humans  - heat energy  - some mammals  - referees Answer:","output":"Several things can blow air, including: 1. Wind: Wind is a natural phenomenon caused by the movement of air due to the differences in pressure and temperature in the Earth's atmosphere. It can blow air at varying speeds and directions. 2. Humans: Humans can blow air through their mouths, usually by pursing their lips together and exhaling forcefully. This action can be used to blow out candles or inflate balloons. 3. Some mammals: Certain mammals, such as whales and dolphins, have blowholes. These creatures exhale forcefully through these openings, expelling air and releasing a fine spray of water vapor. Some mammals, like humans, can also blow air through their mouths. 4. Referees: Referees in various sports, such as soccer and basketball, use a whistle to signal various game events. They blow air into the whistle to create a sound that stops play or signals a foul or violation. As for the other options: - Gravity: Gravity is the force that attracts two bodies of mass. It doesn't blow air, but it does influence the movement of air particles and helps maintain the Earth's atmosphere. - Density: Density refers to the mass of an object per unit volume. It plays a role in understanding how air moves, but density itself doesn't blow air. - Volume: Volume is a measure of the amount of space an object occupies. It can be used to describe the amount of air present in a particular space, but volume alone doesn't blow air. - Heat energy: Heat energy is a form of energy that transfers from warmer objects to cooler ones. It doesn't directly blow air; however, it can create differences in pressure and temperature, which can lead to wind and air being blown in natural environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water.

Who would Superman be without the destruction of Krypton? Who would Batman be without the death of his rich parents?  Where does your hero come from? Who were/are your hero's parents? How did your hero gain powers or were they born with them? What does your hero do for a living? What was your character scared of as a child? Who are your character's friends? What does your character want? Does your character have any allies? Now comes the fun part. A superhero's look and uniform are the things that will set them apart from all the other heroes. Superheroes have to look cool, and ready to do battle with evil. Think of a few colors and specific clothing items that will mark your character.  Let the uniform match the abilities. If your superhero has Superman-like abilities, they probably won't need much in the way of protective gear or fancy gadgets. Many characters wear masks to help protect their secret identity. In general, capes are Golden/Silver age traits for a hero, but it's still possible to get away with one. Come up with a symbol. What mark or badge will your character have to let people recognize them instantly? Think of Superman's S and the symbol on Green Lantern's ring. Some comic book heroes don't always have full uniforms, just little things that help you identify them. Think of Wolverine's hair and sideburns. Just as important to the story of a good superhero is their alter-ego or secret identity. A superhero is cool, but the alter-ego is where your superhero comes to life. What does your hero do when they're not swooping in to save the day? Who are they as real people? That's where great characters are made.  Good superheroes need to struggle. Clark Kent is a perfect alter-ego for Superman because he can't do anything right. And the Kryptonian named Kal-El would probably struggle to get everything right on his new Earth home. In some cases, your hero's secret identity might come from the origin story. Maybe your character is a trash collector who gets superpowers after discovering some radioactive waste in the garbage. His/her secret identity might be his/her original job, collecting garbage. Superheroes aren't all good. Good heroes and good stories contain tension, which you can only get if your hero has something to struggle against. Character flaws are an essential part of any good character, superheroes included.  What does your character want? What keeps your character from getting what they want? What is your superhero afraid of? What makes your superhero angry? What is your superheroes weakness? Now that you've got a series of good traits, abilities, and flaws built up for your character, it's time to pick an iconic name. Superheroes should have memorable names that will make for good titles for comic books. Pick one that matches your character's backstory and powers. Not all superheroes need to have names that end with \\"man.\\" John Constantine, Swamp Thing, and Wolverine are all great examples of superheroes that have different sorts of names.","output":"The article talks about how to create a superhero character.

Q: Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Context: Freshwater below Earths surface is called groundwater. The water infiltrates, or seeps down into, the ground from the surface. How does this happen? And where does the water go? Water infiltrates the ground because soil and rock are porous. Between the grains are pores, or tiny holes. Since water can move through this rock it is permeable. Eventually, the water reaches a layer of rock that is not porous and so is impermeable. Water stops moving downward when it reaches this layer of rock. Look at the diagram in Figure 13.11. It shows two layers of porous rock. The top layer is not saturated; it is not full of water. The next layer is saturated. The water in this layer has nowhere else to go. It cannot seep any deeper into the ground because the rock below it is impermeable. The top of the saturated rock layer in Figure 13.11 is called the water table. The water table isnt like a real table. It doesnt remain firmly in one place. Instead, it rises or falls, depending on how much water seeps down from the surface. The water table is higher when there is a lot of rain and lower when the weather is dry. An underground layer of rock that is saturated with groundwater is called an aquifer. A diagram of an aquifer is shown in Figure 13.12. Aquifers are generally found in porous rock, such as sandstone. Water infiltrates the aquifer from the surface. The water that enters the aquifer is called recharge. Most land areas have aquifers beneath them. Many aquifers are used by people for freshwater. The closer to the surface an aquifer is, the easier it is to get the water. However, an aquifer close to the surface is also more likely to become polluted. Pollutants can seep down through porous rock in recharge water. An aquifer that is used by people may not be recharged as quickly as its water is removed. The water table may lower and the aquifer may even run dry. If this happens, the ground above the aquifer may sink. This is likely to damage any homes or other structures built above the aquifer. One of the biggest aquifers in the world is the Ogallala aquifer. As you can see from Figure 13.13, this aquifer lies beneath parts of eight U.S. states. It covers a total area of 451,000 square kilometers (174,000 square miles). In some places, it is less than a meter deep. In other places, it is hundreds of meters deep. The Ogallala aquifer is an important source of freshwater in the American Midwest. This is a major farming area, and much of the water is used to irrigate crops. The water in this aquifer is being used up ten times faster than it is recharged. If this continues, what might happen to the Ogallala aquifer? The top of an aquifer may be high enough in some places to meet the surface of the ground. This often happens on a slope. The water flows out of the ground and creates a spring. A spring may be just a tiny trickle, or it may be a big gush of water. One of the largest springs in the world is Big Spring in Missouri, seen in Figure 13.14. Water flowing out of the ground at a spring may flow downhill and enter a stream. Thats what happens to the water that flows out of Big Spring in Missouri. If the water from a spring cant flow downhill, it may spread out to form a pond or lake instead. Lake George in New York State, which is pictured in Figure 13.15, is a spring-fed lake. The lake basin was carved by a glacier. Some springs have water that contains minerals. Groundwater dissolves minerals out of the rock as it seeps through the pores. The water in some springs is hot because it is heated by hot magma. Many hot springs are also mineral springs. Thats because hot water can dissolve more minerals than cold water. Grand Prismatic Spring, shown in Figure 13.16, is a hot mineral spring. Dissolved minerals give its water a bright blue color. The edge of the spring is   Question: An aquifer is recharged by A:","output":"The water that enters the aquifer is called recharge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \\"in the near future\\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. how is Santolina and Araujia related? A:","output":"Santolina and Araujia are two distinct plant genera belonging to different plant families, but they share some common traits which relate them to each other indirectly. Let's dive deeper into the characteristics, classification, and commonalities between these two genera. 1. Classification: Santolina: This genus belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is commonly known as the daisy or sunflower family. It consists of aromatic, evergreen shrubs that are native to the Mediterranean region. The most well-known species in this genus is Santolina chamaecyparissus, also known as the cotton lavender or lavender cotton. Araujia: This genus belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which is commonly known as the dogbane family. It consists of perennial climbing vines and shrubs that are native to South America, with some species also found in Australia. The most well-known species in this genus is Araujia sericifera, also known as the cruel plant or moth vine. 2. Morphology: Both Santolina and Araujia have unique morphological features that differentiate them from each other, yet they share some similarities as well. Santolina: These evergreen shrubs typically have dense, silver-gray to green foliage, with small, linear or needle-like leaves. The flower heads are arranged in a corymbiform inflorescence consisting of small, tubular, yellow disc florets. The fruit produced is an achene. Araujia: These climbing vines and shrubs have opposite, simple leaves with a twining tendril emerging from the petiole's base. The flowers are typically tubular or bell-shaped, and the color ranges from white to pink or purple. The fruit is a large, pear-shaped follicle that contains numerous seeds with tufts of silky hairs. 3. Habitat and Distribution: While Santolina is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, sunny, well-drained soils, Araujia originates from South America and can be found in diverse environments such as tropical rainforests, subtropical woodlands, and temperate regions. Both genera have been introduced to other parts of the world as ornamental plants and, in some cases, have become invasive species. 4. Uses and Significance: Both Santolina and Araujia have been used for various purposes throughout history, such as medicinal, ornamental, and ecological roles. Santolina: Santolina has long been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, including anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and antifungal remedies. Additionally, the plant's aromatic and insect-repellent properties make it a popular choice for garden borders and companion planting. Araujia: Araujia sericifera has been primarily used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and foliage. However, it should be noted that this species can be invasive and harmful to native environments, which is why caution must be taken while planting it. It also has ethnobotanical uses in some traditional South American cultures. In conclusion, while Santolina and Araujia belong to different plant families and have distinct characteristics, they are indirectly related through their shared roles in the natural world. Both genera serve important ecological functions, provide ornamental value, and have historical uses in human culture. Despite these connections, it's crucial to recognize and respect their differences, unique traits, and specific ecological requirements."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: People who traveled in the past had to put up with many discomforts which we do not have nowadays, and of course they traveled far more slowly. Roads were bad indeed and you often found you could not get along at all because of the mud. In dry weather many places were thick in dust and when it was stormy, trees might fall across the road and it was nobody's business to clear _ away. Ordinary people traveled on foot or on horseback, but everyone who could afford it kept a private coach. There were public coaches too. called \\"stage coaches\\" because long journeys took several days and were done in stages, with stops over night at inns. Some stage, coaches ran only in the summer months. Others all the year around. They were very slow and crowded and passengers often became in on the way because of the swaying  . Break downs were frequent, since many roads were not smooth. So a coach might very easily turn right over. Early in the century coach and wagon builders were encouraged to put very wide wheels on their vehicles. So that these might level the roads a little. But many people complained of this since it slowed travel down a good deal. Most travelers during the 18th century wrote bitterly about the state of the roads. One visitor to Sussex took six hours to travel nine miles in his coach; another wrote to a friend that on time of his journeys \\"almost every mile was marked by the overturn of a carriage\\". Question: The sentence \\"almost every mile was marked by the overturn of a carriage\\" suggests that   _  . Options: A: the coaches were of poor quality B: the writers liked to describe the road bitterly C: the road condition was really poor D: travelling about in the past was extremely slow A:","output":"The sentence \\"almost every mile was marked by the overturn of a carriage\\" suggests that Option C: the road condition was really poor.  The article describes the discomforts people experienced while traveling in the past, with a focus on the poor road conditions and how it impacted travel. The mention of overturned carriages demonstrates that the roads were in bad shape, which can be attributed to the mud, dust, and fallen trees that were mentioned earlier in the article. These challenges made travel difficult and slow for people using private coaches, public stage coaches, and other forms of transportation. While it could be argued that Options A, B, and D have some relevance to the topic, it is clear that the primary concern expressed in the quote is the poor road condition. The coaches may have been of poor quality (Option A), but this does not directly pertain to the quote stating that carriages were overturned during their journey. The writers may have described the road bitterly (Option B), but the focus of this quote is on the road's condition, not necessarily the writers' emotions. Traveling in the past was undeniably slower (Option D), and while this is evident in the article, it is the poor road condition that directly contributes to the overturned carriages, thus making Option C the best answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The lumbosacral joint is a joint of the body, between the last lumbar vertebra and the first sacral segment of the vertebral column. In some ways, calling it a \\"joint\\" (singular) is a misnomer, since the lumbosacral junction includes a disc between the lower lumbar vertebral body and the uppermost sacral vertebral body, as well as two lumbosacral facet joints (right and left zygapophysial joints).  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - The cecum or caecum (plural ceca ; from the Latin \\"caecus\\" meaning blind) is an intraperitoneal pouch that is considered to be the beginning of the large intestine. It is typically located on the right side of the body (the same side of the body as the appendix, to which it is joined).   - In human anatomy, the thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm, is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity and performs an important function in respiration: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases and air is drawn into the lungs.  - An intervertebral disc (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together. Their role as shock absorbers in the spine is crucial.  - The pelvic inlet or superior aperture of the pelvis is a planar surface which defines the boundary between the pelvic cavity and the abdominal cavity (or, according to some authors, between two parts of the pelvic cavity, called lesser pelvis and greater pelvis).  - The ascending colon is the part of the colon located between the cecum and the transverse colon.  - The thorax or chest (from the Greek  \\"thorax\\" \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain.  - In anatomy, the abdominal wall represents the boundaries of the abdominal cavity. The abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides) and anterior (front) walls.  - The rectum (from the Latin \\" \\", meaning \\"straight intestine\\") is the final straight portion of the large intestine in some mammals, and the gut in others. The human rectum is about long, and begins at the rectosigmoid junction (the end of the sigmoid colon), at the level of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is used. Its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon at its commencement, but it is dilated near its termination, forming the rectal ampulla. It terminates at the level of the anorectal ring (the level of the puborectalis sling) or the dentate line, again depending upon which definition is used. In humans, the rectum is followed by the anal canal, before the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the anal verge.  - The transverse colon is the longest and most movable part of the colon . It crosses the abdomen from the ascending colon at the hepatic or right colic flexure with a downward convexity to the descending colon where it curves sharply on itself beneath the lower end of the spleen forming the splenic or left colic flexure . In its course , it describes an arch , the concavity of which is directed backward and a little upward . Toward its splenic end there is often an abrupt U-shaped curve which may descend lower than the main curve . It is almost completely invested by peritoneum , and is connected to the inferior border of the pancreas by a large and wide duplicature of that membrane , the transverse mesocolon . It is in relation , by its upper surface , with the liver and gall - bladder , the greater curvature of the stomach , and the lower end of the spleen ; by its under surface , with the small intestine ; by its anterior surface , with the posterior layer of the greater omentum and the abdominal wall ; its posterior surface is in relation from right to left with the descending portion of the duodenum , the head of the pancreas , and some of the convolutions of the jejunum and ileum . The transverse colon absorbs water and salts .  - The pubic symphysis or symphysis pubis is the midline cartilaginous joint (secondary cartilaginous) uniting the superior rami of the left and right pubic bones. It is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to it. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the pubic symphysis. In females, the pubic symphysis is intimately close to the clitoris. In normal adults it can be moved roughly 2 mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth.  - The sigmoid colon (pelvic colon) is the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus. It forms a loop that averages about 35-40 cm in length. The loop is typically shaped like a Greek letter sigma () or Latin letter S (thus \\"sigma\\" + \\"-oid\\"). This part of the colon normally lies within the pelvis, but on account of its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into the abdominal cavity.  - The pelvic brim is the edge of the pelvic inlet. It is an approximately apple-shaped line passing through the prominence of the sacrum, the arcuate and pectineal lines, and the upper margin of the pubic symphysis.  - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).  - A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys.  - The abdominal cavity is a large body cavity in humans and many other animals that contains many organs. It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity. It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity. Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs, and its floor is the pelvic inlet , opening into the pelvis.  - The descending colon is the part of the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. The function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store the remains of digested food that will be emptied into the rectum.  - The spleen (from Greek \\"spln\\") is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter.  - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear.  - The cephalothorax, also called prosoma in some groups, is a tagma of various arthropods, comprising the head and the thorax fused together, as distinct from the abdomen behind. (The terms \\"prosoma\\" and \\"opisthosoma\\" are equivalent to \\"cephalothorax\\" and \\"abdomen\\" in some groups.) The word \\"cephalothorax\\" is derived from the Greek words for head  and thorax . This fusion of the head and thorax is seen in chelicerates and crustaceans; in other groups, such as the Hexapoda (including insects), the head remains free of the thorax. In horseshoe crabs and many crustaceans, a hard shell called the carapace covers the cephalothorax.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.  - The large intestine, or the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in vertebrates. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.    What object entity has the relation of 'subclass of' with the subject 'transverse colon'?   Choices: - account  - anatomy  - animal  - anus  - being  - body cavity  - body fluid  - carbonate  - chest  - chest pain  - childbirth  - chordata  - column  - curve  - digestion  - edge  - exoskeleton  - feces  - final  - floor  - fluid  - food  - forming  - function  - fusion  - greek  - greek letter  - gut  - heart  - human  - inlet  - joint  - junction  - latin  - length  - letter  - ligament  - line  - loop  - majority  - muscle  - node  - opening  - organ  - oxygen  - part  - penis  - plural  - promontory  - roof  - rotation  - shell  - species  - split  - structure  - surface  - system  - third  - vertebra  - vertebrata  - wall  - water  - word A:","output":"The transverse colon is a subclass of the large intestine.

San Diego lost 22-10 to the Broncos after struggling offensively for the second consecutive week. After entering the game with the 6th best record in the AFC, the loss was a blow to the Chargers' (8-6) playoff chances. It was their second consecutive home loss to the two teams tied for the best record in their conference. Denver's Manning threw a scoring pass to Demaryius Thomas at the end of the third quarter for their only touchdown of the game. The Chargers pulled to within six points at 16-10 after a TD catch by Gates with 10 minutes left. The Chargers trailed only 9-3 at the half after holding the Broncos to a field goal each time they entered the red zone. Manning was sick coming into the game, and left late in the second quarter with a thigh injury. Set up by a 58-yard punt return by Royal, Novak kicked a 30-yard field goal before the half ended for the Chargers' first score. Manning began the third quarter, and finished the game completing 14 of 20 passes for 233 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. Novak missed two field goals in the game: a 46-yard attempt that was tipped by Derek Wolfe in the second quarter, and a 37-yard attempt that hit the left upright in the third. The Chargers were using a new holder with punter Mat McBriar, who was replacing the injured Scifres, but Novak refused to use it as an excuse. Novak placed the blame of the loss on himself, whose missed kicks would have tied the score and kept the game in reach. Rivers completed 24 of 41 attempts for 232 yards with two interceptions. Gates' touchdown was his 10th of the season, tying him with Gronkowski for most seasons with at least 10 touchdown catches by a tight end. Allen exited the game in the third quarter after suffering both a broken right collarbone and an injured right ankle in the second quarter; the collarbone sidelined him for the final two games of the season. The Chargers' defense limited Denver to 111 yards on 39 carries, an average of 2.8 yards per rush. They also held the Broncos to 3-for-12 on third-down conversions.

The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found.

Translation from Czech to English In English: Concerns or complaints about working hours may refer to issues that employees have with their schedules, the number of hours they are required to work, or the distribution of those hours across the workweek. These concerns can lead to dissatisfaction, stress, or other negative consequences for employees, and it's essential for employers to address these complaints in a fair and effective manner to maintain a healthy work environment. There are various reasons why employees might have complaints regarding working hours, and addressing these concerns can involve understanding the specific issues that employees are experiencing. Some common complaints related to working hours include: 1. Long working hours: Employees may be unhappy with frequent overtime or extended shifts, which can lead to burnout, increased stress, and reduced work-life balance. 2. Unpredictable schedules: Unpredictable or frequently changing schedules can be challenging for employees to manage, especially when it comes to balancing other commitments such as childcare or personal responsibilities. 3. Insufficient breaks or rest periods: Inadequate rest breaks or lack of time to recharge during the day can contribute to fatigue and decreased productivity. 4. Inflexible working hours: Employees may have concerns if their work schedule does not allow for flexibility, such as adjusting start and end times or working from home when necessary. 5. Unequal distribution of work hours: Workers may feel unfairly treated if some employees are consistently given more favorable hours or if there is a lack of transparency in how hours are assigned. To address these complaints effectively, employers should consider implementing measures that promote a healthier and more balanced approach to working hours. Some possible solutions include: 1. Establishing clear policies regarding working hours and overtime, including maximum hours and required rest periods. 2. Offering more predictable and stable work schedules, allowing employees to plan around their work commitments more effectively. 3. Ensuring that sufficient breaks are provided throughout the day, including time for employees to eat, rest, and recharge. 4. Encouraging greater flexibility in working hours, such as allowing employees to adjust their start and end times or work remotely as needed. 5. Implementing a fair and transparent system for assigning work hours, so employees can trust that their schedules are being determined fairly and consistently.

Relationships that drain our energy can manifest in a variety of personality types. Recognize the various forms psychic vampires can take.  Narcissistic psychic vampires have grandiose senses of self importance and entitlement. They tend to lack empathy and become withholding or cold if you don't do things their way. This is because they have little to no capacity for unconditional love. Victim vampires tend to see the world through the lens of \\"poor me.\\" They believe the world is inherently against them and to blame for their unhappiness. They tend to drain energy by constantly complaining about problems but refusing to try any potential solutions you suggest. Alternatively, they may act as a martyr, claiming that they do things for others but are never appreciated. Controlling energy vampires have a need to control and manipulate your actions. They often invalidate your emotions in order to dominate you or put you down.  Constant talking psychic vampires take over conversations by constantly sharing their own feelings and experiences without giving you an opportunity to contribute. They might also invade physical boundaries, moving in so close you can feel their breath on you.  Drama queen psychic vampires drain energy by exaggerating small instances. Being late for a meeting is the end of the world, and they convey small matters in a way that over-inflates their own importance, for better or worse. Take a minute to assess your relationship with potential psychic vampires. Question whether or not you feel drained by these people and whether the relationship is mutually beneficial.  Are you mentally and physically exhausted after spending time with this person? Psychic vampires will leave you feeling deflated. Are you the type of person who has a strong capacity for empathy? Oftentimes, psychic vampires take advantage of those with a high emotional capacity as they take longer to get fed up. Are you the type of person who's accused of being too nice? Do you frequently find yourself in relationships that feel one-sided?  If a relationship seems draining, question whether it's mutually beneficial for both parties. Psychic vampires thrive on one-sided friendships and romances. Think of the last time you were in emotional distress. Was this person there for you? Did he or she strive to listen or make the situation about themselves? If you've encountered a psychic vampire, there are physical and emotional side effects. You might have a relationship with an energy vampire if you display any of the following symptoms:  Heavy eyelids and an increased need for sleep Decreasing levels of self-confidence or self-esteem Questioning your choices, feelings, and behaviors Low mood Desire to binge eat carbs and other comfort foods Feelings of anxiety, depression, and negativity You feel put down frequently","output":"The article discusses the concept of psychic vampires, which are individuals who emotionally and energetically drain those around them through various behaviors and personality traits, such as narcissism, victim mentality, controlling behavior, constant talking, and being a drama queen.

Article:The survey taken at polling stations across the UK suggests the Tories could get 314 MPs when all the results have been counted in Thursday's election. Labour would get 266, the Lib Dems 14, UKIP none and the SNP 34, the GFK/Ipsos MORI poll for BBC/ITV/Sky suggests. Early results are suggesting a small swing to Labour but it is too early to say if the exit poll is accurate. Turnout is so far up by 3 points on the 2015 general election, which means it could be close to 70% by the end of the night, the highest since 1997. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, who held his West Bromwich East seat, said the \\"hours to come look very uncertain\\", but added: \\"Theresa May's authority has been undermined by this election. She is a damaged prime minister and her reputation may never recover.\\" Labour saw off a Conservative challenge to hold Darlington and took Stockton South back from the Conservatives, denting Theresa May's hopes of a revival in the North East of England and a landslide victory. Labour gained Rutherglen and Hamilton West from the SNP, with an 8.9% swing, suggesting, said polling expert John Curtice, that the SNP \\"are going to suffer quite substantial losses\\". The SNP has also lost Angus, in North East Scotland, to the Conservatives. Labour also held Wrexham, a top Conservative target in Wales and took the Vale of Clwyd from the Conservatives, it's first gain of the night from Mrs May's party. Labour also took Battersea, in South London, from the Conservatives, with Treasury Minister Jane Ellison losing her seat. Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry told BBC News: \\"It is possible that we will form the next government.\\" She ruled out a coalition, saying Labour would form a minority government in the event of a hung parliament, asking the smaller parties such as the Lib Dems and the SNP to support its programme in a Queen's Speech. But veteran Conservative Ken Clarke said he believed his party would have a \\"small overall majority\\" when all the votes have been counted, although we might not know the result until much later on Friday. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name To get an overall majority, one party needs to get 326 seats. The exit poll suggests the Conservatives would be 12 short of an overall majority. It suggests Labour would gain 34 seats, the Conservatives would lose 17 seats, the Lib Dems would gain six and the SNP lose 22 seats. The Green Party would be unchanged with one seat and Plaid Cymru would still have three MPs, according to the poll. In total, 30,450 people were interviewed as they exited 144 polling stations across the UK. If these numbers are correct, Theresa May played a high risk political game and has lost it  - she didn't have to call this election, and only did so in order to give herself a mandate and breathing space during the bumpy ride of Brexit. Just a few weeks ago at the start of all of this she seemed unassailable, but a shaky campaign and an insurgent Labour Party may have dashed the Tories' hopes. This exit poll result is not what either parties were predicting privately - this would be another political surprise - the public again defying the expectations of both the main sides. The Conservatives do look set to be the largest party, it's not clear on these numbers if they will be able to govern alone - Theresa May's promise throughout was to offer her catchphrase \\"strong and stable leadership\\" - instead she may end diminished - but only of course, your votes, and the real results, will determine through the course of the night what really happens next. Evening Standard editor George Osborne, who was sacked as chancellor last year by Theresa May, said, if borne out by actual results, the \\"catastrophic\\" exit poll figures would put Mrs May's future as Conservative leader in doubt. SNP Deputy Leader Stewart Hosie said it would be an \\"extraordinary thing\\" for Theresa May \\"to call this election for narrow party advantage and then, if these numbers are correct, to blow it incredibly\\". He said the SNP would still win the election in Scotland, despite the exit poll forecasting substantial losses. A Lib Dem source said it was \\"too early\\" to comment on the exit poll, but added: \\"In this election holding our own is a good night.\\" The party ruled out going into coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour. Green co-leader Caroline Lucas said she could \\"hardly dare hope\\" that the exit poll was right, adding: \\"To be clear, Greens will never support a Tory government.\\" UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said: \\"If the exit poll is true then Theresa May has put Brexit in jeopardy. I said at the start this election was wrong. Hubris.\\" The Conservatives could still secure an overall majority if, as the exit poll suggests, they perform relatively well in constituencies that Labour are defending where a majority of all voters voted Leave in last year's EU referendum. They would also need to do better in marginal seats they are defending. If neither of these patterns materialises, but the exit poll's estimate of the overall levels of support for the parties is correct, then the Conservatives could lose their overall majority. In addition, there is some evidence from the exit poll that the Conservatives will perform relatively well in Wales. If the exit poll is correct the SNP could suffer heavier losses than was widely anticipated in advance of polling day. Indeed this, together with clear evidence of a Conservative revival north of the border, may yet provide the Tories with the extra seats that they might need to secure an overall majority. A total of 650 Westminster MPs will be elected, with more than 45 million people entitled to vote. Some votes had been cast before Thursday through postal voting, which accounted for 16% of the total electorate at the 2015 general election, when the overall turnout was 66%. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"This is an article about an election in the United Kingdom.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity....  Guess a valid title for it!

Any high school students lucky enough to be accepted to Harvard University can easily count themselves among the country's best and brightest.  The story of David Boone's journey from sleeping on a park bench to one of Harvard's dorm rooms, certainly stands out from the crowd of his peers.  David, a 17-year-old senior at a MC2 Stem, a high school in Cleveland, Ohio that focuses largely on engineering and science classes with the help of a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was offered a full-ride scholarship to Harvard in the fall.  His family life has been complicated for the past few years after gangs and economic hardships resulted in him being separated from his family and forced to look after himself on the streets and park benches in Cleveland.  Because both his grandmother and mother could not afford to house the teenagers, his siblings split up to stay with various family friends, but because of space issues and his allergies to the families pets, David was unable to stay. He ended up in the safer neighborhood of Coventry where there was a safer park with fewer dangers.  \\"All of these life lessons have shaped me into who I am, transforming my dreams and aspirations and allowing me to free myself from what was becoming an unproductive environment,\\" he wrote in his blog post.  David's thirst for knowledge had never been reduced and his enthusiasm for engineering and science was growing. A short while later, Jeff McClellan, the principal of MC2 Stem was immediately impressed by David's dedication in the face of adversity, as well as his academic talent.  \\"Here's a kid who's doing everything in his power to get where he wants to go and we had the available resources to provide a little additional support, \\"Mr McClellan told the local ABC News.  At MC2 Stem, David found the exact fit, where it seems he was born to absorb what they were offering. Principal Jeff McClellan found David to be a great student and all-around person, but with a serious living situation, so he stepped in to help. After a home discussion with his wife, McClellan decided to offer David a place to live until he could find another home. Mr McClellan and his wife took the teen in and helped him before he found a permanent solution.  When it came to his next step, David aimed high and applied for a list of top colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Yale, Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. In the end, only MIT rejected his application and he was left to choose his own fate from the selective prestigious and mostly Ivy League schools.  David's next challenge is to fight back tears at graduation this weekend. \\"I promised myself I wouldn't cry. But I realize that's what everyone does before they cry.

Are they unluckier than cats of other colors? Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge  cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey  on the Internet. There were 49 statements   matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured   cats are friendly, tri-coloured   cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation  . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that. Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. \\"You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,\\" Cathy Marden, a scientist said.

Write an article based on this summary: Fifty-nine inmates have been killed in a single northern Brazilian prison this year, according to a judicial report. Article:","output":"Title: Judicial Report Reveals Alarming Death Toll in Northern Brazilian Prison Introduction: A recent judicial report has highlighted a concerning issue in Brazil's prison system, revealing that fifty-nine inmates have been killed in a single northern Brazilian prison this year. This news has sparked outrage and raised questions about prison conditions and the need for criminal justice reform in the country. Background: The judicial report, which documents the number of fatalities in Brazilian prisons, has revealed a shocking death toll in a specific northern Brazilian prison. With fifty-nine inmates losing their lives in this particular facility, this number is considered alarming by human rights advocates and those familiar with prison conditions in Brazil. Prison Conditions and Overcrowding: One of the primary reasons behind the high death toll may be attributed to the overcrowded and inhumane living conditions in the prison. Inmates are often housed in extremely cramped spaces, with little to no access to basic necessities such as proper hygiene facilities, medical care, and sufficient nutrition. Additionally, the lack of well-trained prison staff exacerbates the problem as they may not be able to efficiently manage and control the prison population. Gang-Related Violence: Another factor contributing to the deaths is the prevalence of gang-related violence. Brazilian prison gangs often exercise significant power within the facilities, leading to territorial disputes and violence between rival groups. This brutal gang culture is known to perpetuate violence and creates an atmosphere of constant fear among inmates. Call for Criminal Justice Reform: The judicial report's findings emphasize the urgent need for criminal justice reform in Brazil. Advocates are urging the government to address the issues of overcrowded prisons, harsh living conditions, and gang-related violence through various measures. These include investing in staff and infrastructure, increasing the availability of rehabilitation programs, and implementing strategies to break down power structures within prison facilities. Conclusion: The troubling revelations of this report have put a spotlight on Brazil's prison system and the pressing need for reform. As citizens, officials, and human rights advocates call for change, it is crucial that the Brazilian government takes decisive action to address these concerning issues and to put an end to the needless loss of life behind bars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, three farmers are attempting to remove an ominous stone column from a field. Two of the farmers head home. A thunderstorm appears out of nowhere, and smoke pours from the ground. Lightning strikes the column. The monster Rawhead Rex rises from the dirt. Howard meets Declan O'Brien (Ronan Wilmot), who directs him to Reverend Coot. The curious O'Brien approaches the altar and places his hand on it. Images flash before his eyes. This experience apparently destroys O'Brien's sanity. Afterwards, Howard inquires about the church's parish records. Coot says he can arrange to have Howard look at them. Later, a man arrives at the home of locals Dennis and Jenny. He discovers a clearly traumatized Jenny. Police arrive. Rawhead drags Dennis's dead body through the forest and comes upon a trailer park. A teenager named Andy Johnson is trying to make out with his girlfriend. The two teens head into the woods. Soon after, Howard sees Rawhead on top of a distant hill with Andy's head in his hand. Afterwards, Howard speaks again with Coot, who tells him the church's parish records have been stolen. Declan O'Brien destroys his camera. He takes his family on the road again. On the road, Howard's daughter needs to go to the bathroom, so Howard pulls over and lets her go by a tree. Hearing her suddenly scream, Howard and his wife rush to her; Howard's son stays in the van, alone. Rawhead kills Howard's son and takes the body into the woods. Infuriated by the police's unsuccessful efforts to track down Rawhead, Howard returns to the church. He discovers that there is a weapon shown in the stained glass window that can be used to defeat the monster.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What did Chartwell have extensive views of? , can you please find it?   Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy. After Churchill's death, Lady Churchill...","output":"Chartwell has extensive views of the Weald of Kent.

It's important to have multiple options that sound good to you.","output":"Step 1: Research natural remedies for gastroparesis In order to treat gastroparesis naturally, it's essential to first understand the condition and investigate potential remedies. This can be done by searching for reliable sources of information, such as medical journals, websites, and expert recommendations. It's important to consider the pros and cons of each remedy and make sure to avoid self-prescribed treatments without proper guidance. Step 2: Maintain a food journal Keeping track of the food consumed and symptoms experienced can help in identifying potential triggers and making the necessary adjustments to the diet. This will aid in managing gastroparesis symptoms more effectively. Step 3: Consume smaller, more frequent meals Eating smaller portions of food spread throughout the day can be helpful in managing this condition. Breaking the meals into 5-6 smaller portions can prevent the stomach from becoming overly full and reduce the strain on the digestive system, making it easier to process the food. Step 4: Choose easily digestible foods Selecting foods that are easily digestible, such as low-fat, low-fiber, and soft-textured items, can help in easing the strain on the stomach and promoting better digestion. Step 5: Stay hydrated Drinking enough water is crucial for overall health and digestion. Ensure that you consume an adequate amount of fluids throughout the day, avoiding carbonated and caffeinated drinks, as they can exacerbate gastroparesis symptoms. Step 6: Engage in gentle activities after meals Engaging in mild physical activities like walking or doing simple stretches after meals can promote proper digestion and reduce the likelihood of experiencing gastroparesis symptoms. Step 7: Consider natural supplements Certain herbal supplements and enzymes have been suggested to help improve digestion and alleviate gastroparesis symptoms. Speak with a healthcare professional about the use of natural supplements to support digestive health and ensure they do not interfere with any existing medications. Step 8: Manage stress Stress can negatively impact the digestive system, so it's essential to implement stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, and deep breathing exercises to maintain a healthy mind and body. Step 9: Seek professional guidance As mentioned initially, visiting a doctor or dietitian is crucial for creating a personalized diet plan and getting expert advice tailored to the individual's needs. In conclusion, treating gastroparesis naturally involves researching the condition, making dietary adjustments, staying hydrated, engaging in gentle activities, managing stress, and seeking professional guidance for a personalized approach.

People have often worked together to collect and save the world's art treasures. Fine art treasures from many countries are kept in an art museum called the Louvre   in Paris, France. The works of art have been collected by the people of France over many centuries. It is the biggest art museum in the world. The Louvre has not always been a museum. The first building was a fort. In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew. By 1350, the castle no longer needed a fort. The Louvre became a palace home for French kings and queens. During times of peace, new treasures were brought in. During the days of war, many treasures were stolen, and the buildings were damaged. When Francis I became king of France in 1515, he brought in many artists from other countries. One of the artists was Lenardo da Vinci from Italy. Da Vinci's \\"Mona Lisa\\" is the best known painting in the museum today. In 1793, the Louvre became a public museum.

Question: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts.  Now, I have a new situation: Mark is a biologist. He is trying to see how to make chemical reactions within organism easier. To that end, he conducts two tests, test A an test B, on an organism. In test A he reduces catalysts from the organism, but in test B he induces catalysts in the organism. He needs to observe the outcomes of these tests.  Answer this question please: Would test B see reactions taking place slower or faster than test A? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided background information, test B would see reactions taking place faster than test A.  In test A, Mark reduces the catalysts (enzymes) from the organism. Since catalysts are responsible for speeding up chemical reactions, reducing their presence would result in slower reaction rates within the organism. This could potentially hinder the organism's ability to carry out essential life processes efficiently. In test B, Mark induces (increases) catalysts in the organism. As catalysts (enzymes) speed up chemical reactions, increasing their presence would result in faster reaction rates within the organism. This would help enhance the efficiency of the life processes happening in the organism. In conclusion, test B, where catalysts are induced, would have chemical reactions taking place faster than test A, where catalysts are reduced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up.

In addition to a produce market in Cornville, Arizona; Keenan, whose grandparents and great-uncle made wine in Northern Italy, owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars, based in the unincorporated area of Page Springs/Cornville, Arizona, southwest of Sedona, where he resides. While the winery is named after an ancient symbol for commerce (caduceus), the vineyard is named after a pubic wig (merkin). He is also a partner of Stronghold Vineyards, \\"an 80-acre site dedicated to producing affordable wines in the state\\", located in the small, unincorporated area known as Kansas Settlement in Sulfur Springs Valley, Arizona. Keenan's mother died in 2003, at the age of 59, due to complications from an aneurysm.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Peter Gill told the BBC that UK courts would not accept forensic tests whose details are kept secret due to commercial confidentiality issues. He said this would prevent proper scrutiny of forensic techniques. Professor Gill also warned the National DNA Database needed upgrades urgently. And that without them, the UK resource would fall behind comparable systems used in other countries. Late last year, the government said the Forensic Science Service would be wound up, adding that as many of its operations as possible were to be transferred or sold off. The Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) agreed to set up a working group to ensure a \\"smooth transition\\" as the Forensic Science Service (FSS) was wound down. Now based at the University of Oslo, Norway, Peter Gill helped develop the DNA fingerprinting technique used widely by crime scene investigators - along with Sir Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester. \\"Courts will not accept secret tests that have not been subject to rigorous peer review and challenge,\\" Professor Gill has said in his submission to the House of Commons science committee's inquiry into the closure of the Forensic Science Service (FSS). \\"The public will not accept sub-standard tests being used in any laboratory.\\" He added: \\"An exploratory framework is needed to discover whether laboratories are providing sub-standard results.\\" Professor Gill cited one recent court case where the judge criticised the FSS for using an internally developed \\"commercial in confidence\\" database. \\"This case... demonstrates that a serious mismatch exists between the government's aspiration to privatise forensic science, versus the court requirement for openness, disclosure, and scientific peer review,\\" said Professor Gill. \\"It is easily demonstrated, therefore, that the framework to utilise forensic science in the UK, where the market is entirely privatised, is already fatally flawed.\\" The FSS analyses evidence from crime scenes in England and Wales, but has been losing about £2m a month. It employed 1,600 people and handled more than 120,000 cases each year. \\"The NPIA, ACPO and Home Office will continue to work with the Forensic Science Service to ensure that transition arrangements are in place to manage the wind-down of their forensic services,\\" said a joint statement from ACPO and the NPIA. The government wants private enterprise, which currently makes up 40% of the market, to fill the gap left behind by the FSS. However, many experts are sceptical that this can work and point out that the UK's private forensics sector is shrinking. There are also concerns that an over-emphasis on profits could threaten the quality of science. At the time of the government's announcement, Crime Reduction Minister James Brokenshire said private sector competition for police contracts was enabling forces to achieve greater efficiency. He said that the Forensic Science Regulator should ensure that quality standards are maintained. Professor Gill said the UK's National DNA Database was already out of date, and in urgent need of upgrades to bring it in line with standards rapidly being adopted elsewhere in the European Union. He said there was no timescale or coherent strategy for the adoption of these standards in the UK. \\"Being locked in the past, the inevitable consequence is that casework is carried out with less efficiency than would otherwise be the case elsewhere in the EU. Cases will effectively be 'lost' - i.e. they will fail to provide probative results in laboratories not equipped with the latest technology,\\" said Peter Gill.

Older learners are often more motivated to learn and have a greater grasp on their current reading level. Ask them for their self-assessed reading level and what they're comfortable reading now. Start there and make adjustments as necessary. It's also a good idea to get an idea of what their interests are so that you can meet their needs. You could ask questions like these: \\"What are your favorite genres?\\" \\"What do you find interesting to read about?\\" or \\"What do you think makes reading the most difficult?\\" Adolescent and adult learners understandably don’t want to read children’s books. For these students, search for crime fiction or other adult themes tailored to low literacy levels. You could also look for edited versions of the classic authors, such as Shakespeare. Some possible choices are:   Reading Shakespeare with Young Adults by Mary Ellen Dakin  The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin  Before We were Free by Julia Alvarez Divide students into small groups. Have them read the title of their assigned reading, as well as the captions to any illustrations in the reading. By reserving time for this activity in class, you’ll emphasize the importance of previewing in their future readings. Some examples of  guiding questions for this assignment are:  This book is called How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents. Based on that title, what do you think this book is about? What information does this photograph of Civil Rights activists sitting at a “Whites Only” counter give us about the newspaper article? Dictionaries are great, but looking up individual words can make readers lose their focus of the subject matter of their assignment. Teach students the importance of figuring out the meanings or significance of words from the context of the sentence or paragraph. You can teach context though:  Fill-in-the-blank questions. Students complete by choosing one of three possible words under or to the side of the question. Antonym exercises. Students must figure out the meaning of one word by analyzing the use of its antonym (a word they already know) in the same sentence. An example would be: While Mrs. Smith welcomed all immigrants, her neighbor was xenophobic. What does xenophobic mean? Have your students plan which strategies they’ll use for their assigned readings. For the next class, ask them which strategies helped the most. Examples of reading strategies are:  Skimming Using context Trying to predict what will happen next in a narrative Summary:","output":"To help older learners improve their reading skills, start by asking them about their self-assessed reading level and preferred genres. This will help you choose adult-themed materials that cater to low literacy levels. Encourage students to preview readings by discussing titles and captions related to illustrations in the material.

Finally, encourage students to plan and apply different reading strategies, such as skimming and predicting, and discuss which strategies worked best for them in the next class.

The answer is:","output":"Gaston Camille Charles Maspero, a prominent figure in the field of Egyptology, was born on June 23, 1846, in Paris, France. His fascination with the ancient world, coupled with his academic pursuits, led him to contribute significantly to our understanding of ancient Egypt and its culture. In his youth, Maspero showed an extraordinary appetite for learning and soon found his interests veering towards ancient civilizations. His birthplace, Paris, with its renowned libraries and museums, served as an excellent canvas for nurturing his curiosity about Egypt. Maspero's prime years were dedicated to the academic exploration of Egypt's ancient past. His occupation as an Egyptologist entailed rigorous research, interpretation, and teaching. His work significantly enriched the field of Egyptology. His profound interest in hieroglyphics, Egyptian artifacts, and their underlying significance led to considerable advancements in our understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization. Interestingly, Maspero's enthusiasm for Egyptology was passed down to the next generation of his family. His son, Henri Maspero, followed in his father's footsteps, building on the scholarly foundation laid by his father to further enhance the study of ancient civilizations, particularly the Far East region. Notably, the Maspero lineage of scholars didn't stop there. François Maspero, Gaston's grandson, also carried forward his family's legacy in the academic realm, though he adopted a different but no less important field. Gaston Maspero's life was a testament to the power of academic curiosity. His relentless dedication to the study of ancient Egypt led to significant revelations about the civilization's culture, rituals, and everyday life. He spent his life educating others and expanding the understanding of a civilization that existed thousands of years ago. In addition to his professional endeavors, Gaston Maspero's life was marked by personal relationships. Family stood as a pillar of strength in his life, with his relatives playing a vital role in shaping his personal and professional journey, providing a framework of support, encouragement, and inspiration. However, even a life as remarkable as Maspero’s had to meet an end. He passed away in Paris on June 30, 1916. His passing marked the end of a monumental chapter in the history of Egyptology. Today, his contributions are immortalized not just in the volumes of knowledge he left behind, but also through his image, captured in the photograph gaston_maspero.jpg. This image, frozen in time, encapsulates the spirit of an individual who ventured into the depths of history and brought back gems of wisdom and knowledge. In conclusion, Gaston Camille Charles Maspero's life was a blend of extensive scholarly pursuits and familial bonding. Born into a world rapidly advancing, he sought solace in the mysteries of the past, unveiling secrets of an ancient civilization. His dedication and hard work resonate through the halls of academic institutions even today, inspiring a new generation of Egyptologists. His life and remarkable contributions to Egyptology narrate a story of intellectual pursuit, undying curiosity, and familial continuity. His legacy survives, reaching across the boundaries of time and space, emphasizing the relevance of past civilizations in shaping our understanding of human history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Her lack of style or fashion knowledge and fumbling with her job make her an object of scorn around the office. Senior assistant Emily Charlton (Emily Blunt), Miranda's senior personal assistant, is condescending to her. Gradually, though, with the help of art director Nigel (Stanley Tucci), Andrea adjusts to the position and its many perks, including free designer clothing and other choice accessories. She begins to dress more stylishly and do her job competently, fulfilling a seemingly impossible request of Miranda's to get two copies of an unpublished Harry Potter manuscript to her daughters.She also comes to prize chance encounters with attractive young writer Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), who helped her obtain the Potter manuscript and suggests he could help her with her career. At the same time, however, her relationship with her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier), a chef working his way up the career ladder, and other college friends suffers due to the increasing time she spends at Miranda's beck and call.Shortly afterwards, Andrea saves Miranda from social embarrassment at a charity benefit when the cold-stricken Emily falters in reminding Miranda who an approaching guest is.

Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect. If heat is not trapped by our planet, it means that the greenhouse gases are not retaining heat effectively within the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a decrease in global warming. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, are responsible for trapping the sun's heat within the Earth's atmosphere. If these gases are less effective, then there would be less heat retained, thereby reducing the overall global temperature and the effects of global warming.

UPDATED:. 12:13 EST, 8 November 2012. A microlight pilot killed minutes into his first solo flight had had no formal training, air accident investigators reported today. Adrian Paterson, 49, from Clackmannan, Scotland, died when his craft plunged to the ground, probably after stalling following a steep climb, the Department for Transport's air accident investigation branch (AAIB) has revealed. The investigation concluded the crash, in which he is believed to have plummeted up to 300ft in his Gernini Flash IIA, happened because Mr Paterson had attempted a solo flight without the required training. The scene: Adrian Paterson, 49, from Clackmannan, Scotland, died when his craft plunged to the ground, probably after stalling following a steep climb. The investigation concluded the crash happened because Mr Paterson had attempted a solo flight without the required training. Microlight pilots are required to hold a licence that takes a minimum of 25 flight hours to achieve. The crash, in a field in the Carse of Clackmannan near Kennet on April 12, happened after Mr Paterson took off, leaving two friends on the ground. One of them was an experienced microlight pilot, although not an instructor, who helped taxi the aircraft into position. The AAIB said Mr Paterson had bought the microlight last autumn, but the Civil Aviation Authority was not notified and it was deregistered in December. The 23-year-old aircraft was in good condition, despite not having been officially inspected for three years. The AAIB also found no record of Mr Paterson taking a formal flying training course and he did not have the required medical declaration for flying a microlight. The AAIB said: 'There was some anecdotal evidence that the owner had taken lessons, but the provider was not traced and it is not known how many lessons were undertaken or if the person delivering them was a| qualified instructor.' Mr Paterson was also not a member of a microlight club. The AAIB said he may have had 'only limited experience of flying as a passenger'. He had flown in another microlight before buying his own, but had not operated the controls. The AAIB report stated: 'Immediately after takeoff, the weight-shift microlight entered a steep climb. 'The nose then dropped (probably as a result of a stall) and the aircraft struck the ground in a steep nose-down attitude. 'It is probable that the owner did not vise the correct takeoff technique and allowed the wing to remain in a high angle of attack. 'The rapid nose drop probably occurred as the result of a stall, which may have been exacerbated by the reduction in power. 'The resulting nose-down attitude, with the possible subsequent addition of power so close to the ground, would have made recovery difficult.' The investigation also found no ballast on the rear seat, which is recommended by the aircraft manufacturer when the micro-light is flown solo. The report said a post-mortem examination found Mr Paterson died of multiple injuries, but there was no evidence of drugs, alcohol or natural disease. An ambulance spokesman said at the time of crash: 'Paramedics at the scene estimated that the microlight had come down from a height of between 200ft to 300ft.'","output":"A fatal crash involving a microlight pilot in Scotland has been attributed to the lack of formal training of the pilot, Adrian Paterson. The 49-year-old died minutes into his first solo flight when his craft, a Gernini Flash IIA, plummeted up to 300ft to the ground after stalling following a steep climb. The Department for Transport's air accident investigation branch (AAIB) has concluded that the crash occurred due to Paterson attempting a solo flight without the required training. Microlight pilots are required to hold a license that takes a minimum of 25 flight hours to achieve. However, the investigation revealed that the Civil Aviation Authority did not possess any record of Paterson taking formal flying training courses or having the required medical declaration to fly a microlight. Additionally, there was anecdotal evidence of Paterson having taken lessons, but the provider of these lessons could not be traced nor could the validity of their qualifications as an instructor be confirmed. While Paterson had flown in a microlight before purchasing his own, he had only functioned as a passenger and had not executed any control of the aircraft. The AAIB stated that he may have had \\"only limited experience of flying as a passenger.\\" Furthermore, the investigation found that the aircraft, bought by Paterson in the previous autumn, had not been officially inspected for three years but remained in good condition.

On the day of the crash, Paterson took off in the microlight, leaving two friends, one of whom was an experienced microlight pilot but not an instructor, on the ground.

Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  Two neighboring towns had different demographics.

Article: Decision-thinking is not unlike poker --it often matters not only what you think, but also what others think you think and what you think they think you think.The mental process is similar.Naturally,this card game has often been of considerable interest to people who are,by any standards,good thinkers. The great mathematician John von Neumann was one of the founders of game theory.In particular,he showed that all games fall into two classes:there are what he called games of  'perfect information', games like chess where the players can't hide anything or play tricks:they don't win by chance,but by means of logic and skills.Then there are games of 'imperfect information', 1ike poker,in which it is impossible to know in advance that one course of action is better than another. One mistaken idea about business is that it can be treated as a game of perfect information.Quite the reverse.Business,politics,life itself are games which we must normally play with very imperfect information.Business decisions are often made with many unknown and unknowable factors which would even puzzle best poker players.But few business people find it comfortable to admit that they are taking a chance,and many still prefer to believe that they are playing chess,not poker.

Article: Students who get tired of looking at the four walls of a classroom might like to take the nature course being offered by Carvel College again this summer. Groups of about a dozen students each, led by an experienced guide, will go on ten-day camping trips to the mountains to study the plants and animals that grow and live there. Students carry their own things, which includes sleeping bags, warm clothing, food and water, and other useful tools. And what do the students do all day? Well, as soon as the sun comes up, they eat breakfast and start climbing up the mountain trail to the next campground, which is five to ten miles away. As the students take notes, the guide points out different plants and animals alongside the trail. The climb is usually over by early afternoon, so the group spends the rest of the day resting or swimming in a mountain lake. Before dinner each night, they all come together and discuss the day's activities. At the end of the course, the students write reports using the information they have collected. But they don't mind at all. What they do mind is leaving the beauty of the wilderness and the good friends they've made to return to their normal lives in the city. Question: How far does a student have to walk throughout the course? Answer: A:","output":"50 to 100 miles Justification: From the article, we understand that the course is comprised of ten-day camping trips. Each day, students cover a distance between five to ten miles. To find the total distance a student walks throughout the course, we need to multiply the number of days by the distance covered per day: 10 days * 5 miles (minimum distance per day) = 50 miles (minimum distance covered throughout the course) 10 days * 10 miles (maximum distance per day) = 100 miles (maximum distance covered throughout the course) So, a student has to walk between 50 to 100 miles throughout the course."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Q: What effect causes global winds to blow on a diagonal over the earth's surface?

One of the burglars, a beautiful young woman named Morgana Truscott (Holly Fields), steals the gem and is forced to abandon her partner during the escape. The Djinn escapes and kills the remaining burglar when he accidentally wishes he'd never been born. As the police enter the museum, the demon finishes forming into full size, revealing the Djinn (Andrew Divoff). The Djinn surrenders to the police and is led away. That evening, Morgana is shown sleeping very restlessly, her left arm dangling over the edge of the bed. In the meantime, Demarest is in a holding cell waiting to be transferred to prison, where he kills a fellow prisoner. In her dreams, she sees glimpses of the Djinn in his true form. The next day, Morgana goes to Church to visit the priest tending the church, a man named Gregory (Paul Johannson) - a former lover of Morgana's before he found God and joined the priesthood. In prison, Demarest continues to kill prisoners and other personnel through purposely misconstrued wishes, and is confronted by Butz (Rhino Michaels) and his two henchmen, the Tiger brothers (James Kim and Simon Kim).

WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Yes\\" correctly answer the question \\"Were any of Tocqueville's books written while he was active in french politics?\\"?","output":"Yes, the response \\"Yes\\" correctly answers the question \\"Were any of Tocqueville's books written while he was active in French politics?\\" Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Tocqueville was active in French politics during the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and the Second Republic (1849-1851). His book Democracy in America had its first volume published in 1835, followed by the second volume in 1840. These publications occurred during his active political life under the July Monarchy. He began working on The Old Regime and the Revolution after his retirement from political life, signifying that at least one of his books was written during his active involvement in French politics."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ottawa takes 1st steps to offer cable choice Heritage Minister Shelly Glover has taken the first steps toward meeting a Conservative throne speech promise to provide more choice for Canadian cable customers. In an announcement Thursday in Vancouver, she said the federal government has asked the broadcast regulator to prepare a report on how pick-and-pay television service might work and what steps might have to be taken to unbundle TV services. “We are convinced that this is something that Canadian consumers want,” Glover said. “We want to give them choice and we have indicated very clearly that we will require television channels to be unbundled.” The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission has until April 30 to deliver a report to the minister, who was appointed in July as former heritage minister James Moore moved into the industry portfolio. While most cable providers offer a range of packages with stations bundled together, Vidéotron, Bell and Rogers also offer consumers the option of selecting individual stations to bundle with their basic package. Louis Audet, CEO of Montreal-based cable distributor Cogeco, said the industry is a “full and willing participant” in the process to change how TV is distributed in Canada. “This is a totally normal evolution,” Audet said in an interview with CBC-TV’s Lang & O’Leary Exchange. “We’ve been battling with our program suppliers now for two years to bring more freedom to be able to meet our customer’s demands, which is for more targeted smaller packages.” He said the cable and satellite providers entered arbitration at the CRTC to ask for the freedom to provide a pay-per-channel option. In October, the CRTC announced a new consultation with Canadian consumers, asking what they like and don’t like about their TV service and TV content. Next spring the broadcasters will weigh in and the distributors will also have a chance to comment. One of the big questions is how to meet cultural objectives that are part of the CRTC’s mandate, Audet said. “There is a cultural policy in this country that forces distributors to carry and package channels in a certain manner. It remains to be seen further to the dialogue the CRTC has undertaken with the population on Oct. 24 ... how the cultural policy of this country evolves and as a result of that, through negotiation with program suppliers we’ll see what we are able to do,” he said. Glover said Ottawa has asked the CRTC to determine any costs consumers might face because of unbundling of TV service. It also wants to figure out whether ethnic and specialty channels could survive. Audet said he expects the industry to find ways to integrate video-streaming services such as Netflix into their offerings. Cogeco’s U.S. unit is experimenting with Tivo, a set-top device that allows streaming from the internet, live and on-demand video, as well as broadcast options. “A number of people have seen Netflix as an enemy of cable distributors. We rather see it as a complement to the complete offering of cable distributors,” he said, adding that Cogeco is testing a platform similar to Tivo for the Canadian market. Summary:","output":"Okay kiddo, so you know how when you want to watch your favorite cartoons on TV, we have to subscribe to a lot of channels, many of which we don't watch? In Canada, the government is trying to make it so that we only have to pay for the channels we actually want to watch, like just the cartoon channels for you. This lady named Shelly Glover, who works for the government, is helping make this happen. She's asked some important people to figure out how this might work. But it's not that simple. They have to think about how this may affect other things, like channels that show shows from different cultures, and the cost it may mean for us, the viewers. There's also talk of adding services like Netflix to our TV. So instead of using a different device to watch Netflix, we could watch it right on our TV along with regular channels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, it might not cover every possibility, as foxes inhabit various terrains beyond mountains. 2. Arctic Tundra: Another specific location, the Arctic Tundra refers to the colder regions of Earth where certain species of foxes, like the Arctic fox, can be found. However, not every fox species occupies this type of terrain, and it narrows the range of possibilities, as opposed to a more generalized answer like the great outdoors. 3. Great Outdoors: As mentioned earlier, this term is more aligned with human common sense because it covers multiple types of terrain, including forests, meadows, fields, mountains, and many other natural settings where you can hike and encounter foxes. The great outdoors can be encountered in various locations around the world, making opportunities for hiking and fox encounters more widespread and accessible. 4. Open Meadow: An open meadow is a particular type of landscape where one may hike and possibly spot a fox, but it limits the range of possibilities for the setting, as foxes can inhabit other types of landscapes as well. 5. City: While it is possible to spot a fox in a city, this answer is less likely to be aligned with human common sense, as fox encounters are rarer in urban areas, and cities typically do not provide ideal hiking opportunities when compared to the great outdoors. In conclusion, \\"great outdoors\\" is an answer that resonates with human common sense because it acknowledges the broad range of natural environments where people can enjoy a hike and encounter various species of foxes. It evokes the essence of outdoor exploration, and as a human-compatible AI, it is a suitable answer because it relies on the essence of what humans appreciate about outdoor experiences and wildlife sightings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: -12 * f + 73 = 163 + 6  First, we need to add the numbers on the right side of the equation: 163 + 6 = 169 Now our equation looks like this: -12 * f + 73 = 169 Next, we need to move the 73 from the left side to the right side. We do this by subtracting 73 from both sides: -12 * f = 169 - 73 Now we subtract: 169 - 73 = 96 So the equation is: -12 * f = 96 Now, we need to find the value of 'f'. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -12: f = 96 / -12 Finally, we divide: 96 / -12 = -8 So the solution is: f = -8"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Act 2: FairyT.I.A. sends agents to explore and seize control of the swamp, disrupting the tranquility of Shrek's daily life. Shocked by their intrusion, Shrek sets out on a journey to save his home, enlisting the help of his old friend, Donkey, a likable and talkative animal companion. As they venture forth, Shrek and Donkey encounter several other magical creatures who have been displaced due to FairyT.I.A.'s attempts to exploit and study magical beings.

No. It is not valid to assume that Kendall is \\"trying to cause Lee pain\\" just based on the information provided. Although it is mentioned that Kendall stretched Lee's legs as part of the yoga lesson, there is no clear indication of any intent to cause harm or pain.  Yoga is an ancient practice involving physical, mental, and spiritual aspects that help maintain balance and promote overall well-being. One of its key components is stretching, which is essential in increasing flexibility, promoting relaxation, and enhancing muscle strength. It is common for yoga teachers or practitioners to assist others in performing various stretches to help them achieve the right posture and level of flexibility. This assistance can be seen as a supportive act rather than a harmful one, as the main goal is to help the individual progress in their practice, reduce the risk of injuries, and provide a safe and fulfilling yoga experience. Therefore, it would be more accurate to consider Kendall as a supportive, helpful, and knowledgeable person who is guiding Lee through the yoga lesson and helping them improve their flexibility and overall practice.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? cult film","output":"The sentiment of the phrase \\"cult film\\" itself cannot be accurately classified as positive or negative because the term refers to a type of film rather than expressing any particular emotion or opinion. It is a neutral description of a category of movies. To determine the sentiment, we need to understand the context in which the phrase \\"cult film\\" is used. A cult film is a movie that has acquired a dedicated and passionate fan base, often characterized by its unconventional or controversial content, style, or theme. These films may not have performed well at the box office or received outstanding critical acclaim, but they have gained a devoted following over time. Cult films often resonate with people on a personal level, addressing niche interests and connecting with subcultures that mainstream cinema might overlook. There are various reasons why a movie may be considered a cult film, such as: 1. Unique or provocative subject matter that appeals to a specific audience. 2. The presence of unpopular, controversial, or subversive themes. 3. A distinctive visual or narrative style that sets it apart from mainstream cinema. 4. A heavily quotable or memorable script. 5. A connection with a particular subculture or countercultural movement. Examples of cult films include \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\\" \\"Eraserhead,\\" \\"The Big Lebowski,\\" and \\"Donnie Darko,\\" among many others. The sentiment of the phrase \\"cult film\\" may lean towards positive or negative depending on one's perspective and the specific film being referred to. Some might view cult films positively, emphasizing their creativity, originality, and the dedicated fan base they inspire. Others could see them as negative, focusing on the controversial or subversive aspects that might not resonate with mainstream audiences. To accurately assess the sentiment of the phrase \\"cult film\\" in a given context, it's necessary to examine the surrounding discussion and consider the specific movie being referenced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: The Thrift Savings Plan is preparing to extend its services to participants by reaching out to them about important decisions for their retirement savings, maybe to the point of providing financial advice. A plan outlined at a meeting Monday of the TSP’s governing board would represent a significant shift from the program’s traditional approach of having direct personal contact only with those investors who initiate it, such as to transfer money among investment funds or to withdraw it. “Right now we are built to facilitate transactions. What we are not built to do is engage in conversations around goals,” TSP Executive Director Gregory T. Long told the board. [Treasury again tapping TSP federal retirement fund for debt ceiling relief] Currently, personal contact is “only reactive,” he said. “We have an opportunity to provide a different type of service, something that is more consultative . . . Our participants are asking for and need a greater level of engagement from us.” The TSP is the largest 401(k)-type plan in the country, as of April holding 454 billion in assets for 4.7 million current and former federal employees and military personnel. Long said the transformation likely would take five years or more, and some elements would need approval from the governing board or changes in law. For example, it includes an assumption that the TSP will open an investment “window” through which account holders could direct money to investment funds other than those the TSP itself offers. The TSP has had that authority for years but only recently moved toward carrying it out. A formal recommendation to the board is planned for the upcoming months, although even if approved such an option likely could not be made available until 2017. Another issue ahead, Long said, is the “very meaningful and important line between consultation and advice. Where you cross the line is when you say what someone should do. Are we thinking about it? Absolutely.” Individual attention “is something that really drives participants to action,” said Renee C. Wilder, director of enterprise planning. “It gives them some comfort for making retirement decisions. They are looking for someone to help them plan for their retirement.” Such services could include contact initiated by the TSP, including by phone, at key career points including at hiring, one year later, on moving to another agency or on entering or leaving Reserve service, on reaching certain ages, and at retirement. Other opportunities would arise when an investor contacts the TSP about taking a financial hardship-based withdrawal or transferring an account to an IRA after retirement. While the TSP provides information in printed form and at www.tsp.gov, “the reality is that not everyone is going to absorb information in that way,” Long said. “We want to take advantage of life moments when you’re receptive to information.” “Our phone reps are doing exactly what we are asking them to do, transaction support,” he added. “What I’m advocating here is a different posture for our one on one conversations.” As a step in that direction, the TSP recently began soliciting phone numbers and e-mail addresses from those who check their accounts online. Other planned steps include simplifying and driving online current paper-based transactions such as designations of beneficiaries, as well as improving the online calculator features. Expanding withdrawal options is also on the list, for example to allow more than one partial withdrawal. “What we’re focused on is building a long-term strategic plan for the organization,” said board chairman Michael Kennedy, a managing director in the Atlanta office of Korn/Ferry International. “We still have a way to go from the customer service aspect. We have come a long way over the last year but we certainly have a way to go.” One telling statistic, officials said, is that 55 percent of investors who leave government for retirement or other reasons transfer their money out of the TSP within a year. In many cases they may not even know they can leave their money in the TSP, and they may not realize the TSP has exceptionally low administrative fees for the investment industry, officials said. A note of caution was sounded by Jacqueline Simon, public policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, a member of an advisory board of employee organizations also at the meeting. She said that participants might reject phone contacts out of fear of fraud. “Federal employees are constant targets and I think a lot of our members will be very wary of someone calling saying they’re from the TSP—‘I’m not falling for this.’ A lot of these ideas will have you seem like a marketer,” she told Long. Long said that phone contact would be just one aspect; another would be pop-ups when investors are making certain transactions online asking them if they are aware of the consequences and if they would like to engage in an online chat. Also, some of those concerns would be eased if the TSP established a more personal relationship with investors, he said. Referring to those who transfer their TSP accounts rather than keeping them open, he said, “The way I see it is that 55 percent of people are firing us. You fire people you don’t know.”","output":"\\"Thrift Savings Plan: Advancing Towards Personalized Retirement Savings Support and Consultation\\" In a significant shift from its traditional reactive approach, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), America's largest 401(k)-type plan, is planning to proactively engage with investors about crucial retirement savings decisions. Rather than waiting for investors to initiate contact for transactions such as fund transfers or withdrawals, the TSP team seeks to help guide the investors' journey to achieving their financial goals.  Bearing in mind the delicate line between consultation and advice, the TSP is keenly working towards evolving into a more consultative service, seeking to foster a greater level of engagement with participants. In conceptualizing a future where the TSP initiates contact with investors at key career points and during critical life moments, the program aims to create a more personalized approach towards financial planning and retirement savings. While this transformation is expected to take five years or more, it is hoped that such changes will garner a heightened sense of investor trust and confidence. Speculations around potential changes in law and an opening of investment windows are being reviewed, with formal recommendations to the governing board planned for the months ahead.  Despite comprising the authority to extend its services, TSP has demonstrated a cautious approach, taking into consideration the importance of maintaining confidentiality and preventing potential fraud. As an added layer of security, consideration is being given to incorporating pop-ups during online transactions, consulting investors about potential impacts, and offering opportunities for online chats. Simultaneously, to extend the user's digital experiencex, the TSP has also begun to request personal contact details from investors, including phone numbers and email addresses. In addition to these steps, there are ongoing projections to upgrade and simplify current paper-based transactions by encouraging online operations, broadening withdrawal options, and enhancing online calculator features. Despite the massive steps taken towards better customer service, the TSP acknowledges that there still is a long way to go. One of the challenges being evaluated is the fact that a considerable percentage of investors transfer their money out of the TSP within a year after leaving the government service. By providing more consultative support and establishing a more personal relationship with investors, the TSP intends to counter this trend, emphasizing its exceptionally low administrative fees in the investment industry. With its focus on building a long-term strategic plan for the organization, the TSP is committed to redefining its role in the retirement savings landscape, addressing the need for investors seeking personalized financial guidance, and offering improved transactional and consultative services. Through this evolution, the TSP aims to become more than just a financial institution, but rather, a trusted investment partner for the present and future federal employees and military personnel in America."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

TEXT:For those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline, this one is for you! From the bleak New York City atmosphere, which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality, this movie is a real downer.  Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work.  It also hoped, I'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage. Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too. However, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again.  The acting was good, but so what? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldn't act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people. He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era, playing guys like \\"Ratso Rizzo\\" in this film and then going to be the \\"Rain Man\\" later on. Yes, \\"Ratso\\" is a character you'll never forget, and \\"Joe Buck\\" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting. This movie isn't \\"art,\\" and it isn't worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. It's two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (Andy Warhol even gets in the act - no surprise), and generally despicable people. I did like the catchy song, \\"Everybody's Talking'\\" that helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is their loss). And - as mentioned - the name \\"Ratso Rizzo\\" kind of stays with you! The film is a landmark, but in a negative sense, I fear: this marked it as \\"official\\" that Hollywood had gone down the toilet, and it has remained in the sewer ever since.","output":"The correct sentiment for this text is (A). negative. The text criticizes the film's content, characters, and impact on Hollywood, describing it as depressing, bleak, sordid, stunning, and appalling. It also refers to the movie as \\"gilded garbage\\" and implies that, due to its shady content, the film was undeserving of its many awards. The negative sentiment is further emphasized by the author's personal experience of being left with a bad taste after watching the movie and their belief that it marked a turning point in which Hollywood officially \\"went down the toilet.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What field does the author most probably work in? Options:  A. sales  B. medicine  C.

Article: I can still remember the day I met my best friend Judy. She had just moved into the neighborhood and her grandmother brought her down to meet me. I hid behind my mother and she hid behind her grandmother,scared to look at each other. Soon we lost the shyness and started playing with each other. In the 7th grade ,I first lost touch with her. She was going through family problems and I _ her to be with the cooler people. None of my new friends liked her as much as I did because they knew she had problems. However, every summer we would always sit at each other's house, watch soap operas and talk about all the boys we like. It was last year when I noticed the problem. I guess I was too doveted in high school to realizeshe needed someone there. Anyway ,she made a new best friend and so did I. Then I didn't know why, but she started cutting herself! She then was diagnosed with clinical depression .At first, I was very upset, but we still stayed in touch. I wanted to be there with new her best friend basically deserted her and people were calling her crazy. Yesterday she came to me and said,\\"I never knew what a best friend was until you, the only person, would stop me cutting. I appreciate your help so much, and you didn't even know you were helping me.\\" We both cried. And I guess a kind of lesson from my life so far is never to give up on your friends. Even if they aren't as cool as others, or people think they are crazy, they need someone there. If you desert them, you will only be guilty yourself.

OPT: (1). description; (2). entity; (3). abbreviation; (4). human; (5). numeric; (6). location; Answer:","output":"The question \\"How many logarithmic scales are there on a slide rule?\\" is asking about the numeric aspect (Option 5) of slide rules. To provide a more detailed answer, let's first discuss what slide rules are and their usage. Slide rules are analog calculation devices that were widely used before the advent of digital calculators and computers. They consist of several logarithmic scales (graduated straightedges with scales) that slide against each other. By aligning the scales and reading the results at appropriate points, users can perform various mathematical operations such as multiplication, division, roots, powers, and logarithmic calculations with relative ease and speed. The number of logarithmic scales on a slide rule can vary depending on the complexity of the device and its intended use. Early slide rules typically had only two or three logarithmic scales, while more advanced models, such as the popular Pickett N600-ES slide rule, had additional scales to perform specialized calculations for engineering, science, and mathematics. A common slide rule design features three main logarithmic scales: 1. C and D scales: These are the primary scales for multiplication and division. They are identical with evenly spaced logarithmic markings and cover a range of 1 to 10. To multiply or divide two numbers, the user aligns the C and D scales appropriately and reads the result on the other scale. 2. A and B scales: These scales are used for finding squares and square roots of numbers. They cover a logarithmic range of 1 to 100 and are typically marked in 1/10 increments. Some slide rules also include additional scales for specific operations or applications, such as: - K scale for cube roots and powers - L scale for logarithm base 10 calculations - S scale for trigonometric functions like sine and cosine - T scale for tangents - P scale for square roots of small numbers - DF scale for π-related calculations Overall, the number of logarithmic scales on a slide rule can be anywhere from two or three on a basic device to a dozen or more on advanced models designed for specialized purposes. In summary, the question is asking about the numeric aspect of slide rules, focusing on the presence and variation in the number of logarithmic scales found on these devices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Squeeze the conditioner into your hands and rub them together. Then, use your fingers to smooth the conditioner down the shafts of your hair, starting at the roots. Make sure that you apply an even coating. If you run out of conditioner by the time you get to your ends, simply use a little more. If you prefer, you can use your favourite hair oil instead of conditioner. Coconut oil and olive oil are popular moisturising options. If you have long hair, tie it up in a low bun first. Then, place the shower cap over your head and tuck any stray hairs underneath. Purchase a shower cap from a pharmacy or the hair care aisle of a supermarket. Continue to squeeze the face cloth until there are no drips coming off it. This is important, as hot drips of water have the potential to burn your neck. Shake the face cloth to ensure that there are no drips of water left in it.  If you have a hair turban, you can use this instead of a face cloth. Face cloths work well because of their small size. If you don’t have one, use a similar sized cloth instead. Set the microwave to the highest setting and press start. This heats up the water in the cloth which will help to steam your hair. Don’t worry if you see steam coming off the cloth while it is in the microwave – this is normal. If your microwave plate is dirty, place the face cloth into a microwave-safe bowl to keep it clean. Position the face cloth on the middle of your head over the shower cap. If you feel the face cloth slipping down your head, simply adjust it back onto the middle of your head in a more balanced position. Wear gloves when transferring the face cloth to your head to avoid getting burnt. Alternatively, use a potholder to remove the face cloth. This helps to stop the heat from escaping and encourages steam to form. Don’t worry if the shower cap doesn’t fit over your whole head, simply stretch it over the face cloth. If you don’t have another shower cap, place a plastic rubbish or garbage bag over the face cloth instead. This gives time for the steam to soak into the strands of your hair. Try to sit relatively still so that the face cloth doesn’t slip off your head. Read a book, watch TV, or simply relax!  If you want really moisturised hair, leave it to steam for up to 2 hours. However, be sure to reheat your face cloth 2-3 times during your steam. If the face cloth falls off, simply put it back into its original position and place the shower cap back over it. You might want to reheat it before you replace it if it's cooled off. Take the shower caps and face cloth off your head and untie your hair, if necessary. Then, adjust the shower to the highest pressure and allow the water to push the conditioner out of your hair. The cold water helps to seal the hair cuticles and locks in moisture.  The beautiful moisturised feeling will last about 1 week. Avoid steaming your hair more often than this, as steaming too often weakens your hair. Leave your hair to air-dry. This maximises the moisture in your hair and minimises heat damage.","output":"Apply conditioner or hair oil on your hair evenly, then tie it up and cover with a shower cap. Wet a face cloth, microwave it, and place it over the shower cap. Wear gloves or use a potholder to avoid burns. If needed, use a plastic bag for additional coverage. Steam your hair for up to 2 hours, reheating the cloth 2-3 times. After steaming, remove shower caps and cloth, and rinse hair with cold water. Air-dry for best moisture retention.

Write an article based on this summary: A mere two months ago George Osborne was the second most powerful member of the government.","output":"Title: The Meteoric Fall of George Osborne - From Second in Command to Relative Obscurity Introduction: It was only two months ago that George Osborne reigned as the second most powerful member of the government. Commanding respect and wielding influence, Osborne seemed untouchable. Yet, his meteoric rise was matched only by his sudden fall from grace. This article explores the circumstances surrounding this political enigma and seeks to understand how such a rapid descent came to be. Step 1: Establish Osborne's prior accomplishments and status: Just a few months back, George Osborne held an influential position within the government as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In this role, he played a crucial part in shaping the nation's economic policies and was often seen as the right-hand man to the Prime Minister. With a successful track record, it seemed unlikely that his fall from prominence would happen so quickly. Step 2: Examine the key factors that led to his downfall: Osborne's downfall can be attributed to several significant events that transpired within a short period. These events ultimately exposed his vulnerability as a political figure and hastened his exit from the forefront of government. 1. Political rivalry: Infighting within the ruling party, as well as the rise of new political factions, ultimately weakened Osborne's grip on power. 2. Policy reversals: Some of Osborne's economic strategies met with objections, leading to policy reversals that diminished his credibility in the eyes of his colleagues and the public. 3. Media scrutiny: Osborne's actions and policies were increasingly criticized by the media, which played a role in tarnishing his image and reputation. Step 3: Discuss the implications of his rapid political downfall: The fall of George Osborne from a position of power has left a considerable impact both on him personally and on the government as a whole. His sudden departure has raised questions about the stability and future direction of the administration. Additionally, his absence from the political landscape has left a vacuum that other politicians may be keen to fill, potentially changing the overall dynamic of the government. Step 4: Analyze the lessons to be learned from Osborne's experience: Osborne's dramatic descent from power serves as a cautionary tale for politicians and a reminder of the volatile nature of political success. In the blink of an eye, fortunes can turn, and even the most influential individuals can find themselves left out in the cold. To remain successful in public service, politicians must always be aware of their precarious position and be prepared to adapt to the ever-changing political landscape. Conclusion: In the short span of just two months, George Osborne has gone from being the second most powerful member of the government to a figure of relative obscurity. His rapid fall from grace serves as a sobering reminder of the fickle nature of political power. Through this examination of Osborne's sudden downfall, we come to understand the fragility of political success and the importance for those in positions of power to remain both vigilant and adaptable, lest they suffer a similar fate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which American tennis player won his only Wimbledon singles title in 1992 ?","output":"Andre Agassi, an American tennis player, won his only Wimbledon singles title in 1992. Born on April 29, 1970, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Agassi is widely regarded as one of the most dominant and talented tennis players in the history of the sport. Known for his aggressive playing style, unique fashion choices, and charismatic personality, Agassi had a long and storied career in professional tennis. To provide a detailed and long answer, we can discuss a bit more about his background and achievements. Agassi turned professional in 1986 and was coached by Nick Bollettieri. Bollettieri is a renowned tennis coach who has worked with numerous top players, including Jim Courier, Monica Seles, and Maria Sharapova. Agassi's collaboration with Bollettieri proved to be a pivotal partnership in his career. Agassi had a less-than-stellar start to his career at Wimbledon. Before 1992, his best performances were in 1991 when he reached the quarterfinals and in 1989 when he reached the fourth round. Ranked no. 8 in the world at the time, Agassi was not considered a favorite to win Wimbledon in 1992. However, in 1992, the 22-year-old Agassi showed a new level of dominance at the championships. Throughout the tournament, he defeated several top-ranked players, including Boris Becker (4th round) and John McEnroe (quarterfinals). These victories set up a memorable final match against Goran Ivanišević, a Croatian player ranked no. 15 in the world. In a thrilling five-set battle, Agassi managed to overcome Ivanišević with a score of 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4. This victory marked his first-ever Grand Slam title and a significant milestone in his career. The Wimbledon victory propelled Agassi's rankings to new heights and established him as a formidable force within the tennis world. Beyond his 1992 Wimbledon victory, Agassi won a total of eight Grand Slam singles titles throughout his career. Here's a breakdown: 1. Wimbledon (1992) 2. U.S. Open (1994 and 1999) 3. Australian Open (1995, 2000, 2001, 2003) 4. French Open (1999) The 1999 French Open victory made Andre Agassi one of the few men's singles players to complete a career Grand Slam, winning all four Grand Slam tournaments. Agassi retired from professional tennis in 2006, but his impact on the sport is still felt today. He used his success as a tennis player to give back to his community, establishing the Andre Agassi Foundation for Education, which is dedicated to improving education for children in the United States. He is also involved in charitable activities and mentoring young tennis players, showcasing the same passion and dedication that made him a champion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is currently living in St. George in the Caribbean and then goes to a meeting with her accountant who discusses the inheritance Lisbeth received from her recently deceased mother after funeral costs and the purchase of a house in Stockholm. She hacks Bjurman's account and sees he has scheduled a doctors appointment. She flies home to Sweden.In Stockholm, a messenger working for an unnamed employer visits Bjurman looking for a police report on Lisbeth. He tells her he will make a copy of his files and tells the messenger that Lisbeth is still abroad. The messenger drives him home and tells Bjurman he will be in touch. Lisbeth is watching from the trees and prepares to break into his house. As he sleeps, Lisbeth goes to his desk and looks for something. She finds a gun in his desk and points it at him asking about the files. She tells him that as long as his reports say she's well behaved, she won't send their movie (of Bjurman raping her) to every newspaper in the country. She makes it clear that if she dies, the tape gets released. And if he tries to remove the tattoos she gave him for the rape, she will give him worse ones.Bjurman makes a deal: the DVD recording of the rape for files on her.

Title: The Last Picture Show Movie plot: In 1951, Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) are high-school seniors and friends in a small, declining north Texas town, Anarene. Duane is dating Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), the prettiest (and wealthiest) girl in town. Sonny decides to break up with girlfriend Charlene Duggs (Sharon Ullrick). At Christmastime, Sonny begins an affair with Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman), the depressed, middle-aged wife of his high-school coach, Coach Popper (Bill Thurman). At the Christmas dance, Jacy is invited by Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid) to a naked indoor pool party, at the home of Bobby Sheen (Gary Brockette), a wealthy young man who seems a better prospect than Duane. Bobby tells Jacy he isn't interested in virgins and to come back after she's had sex. The group of boys take their young intellectually disabled friend, Billy (Sam Bottoms), to a prostitute to lose his virginity but she hits Billy in the face when he ejaculates prematurely. When Duane and Sonny take Billy back home, Sam \\"the Lion\\" (Ben Johnson) tells them that since they cannot even take care of a friend, he is barring them from his pool hall, movie theater and cafe. Sonny later sneaks into the cafe and accepts the offer of a free hamburger from the waitress, Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), when Sam walks in and discovers him. Once Sam sees Sonny's genuine affection for Billy he accepts his apology. Duane and Sonny go on a weekend road trip to Mexico, an event that happens off-screen. Before they drive off, Sam comes to encourage them about their trip and gives them some extra money. In the next scene they return hungover and tired and eventually learn that during their absence Sam has died of a stroke.

What are the full names of the two individuals who achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893–96 was an attempt by the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen to reach the geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east–west current of the Arctic Ocean. In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole.  Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land...","output":"The two individuals who achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N during Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893-96 were Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen and his chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen.

Nearly 900,000 Britons have been issued with a fine for motoring offences while driving on holiday abroad. One in 12 holidaymakers have been collared for breaking road rules on foreign trips in their own car, according to a survey. The findings sparked a warning for British travellers to get up to speed with little-known local laws including a Spanish ban on driving in flip-flops and a French restriction on satnav speed camera alerts. Laws in European countries include carrying a spare pair of spectacles in Italy, having a clean car in Russia and not wearing flip-flops to drive in Spain. The research comes amid a row over an EU Directive that will make it easier for police in Europe to trace errant British motorists whilst foreign drivers in the UK often escape scot-free. The research found the popularity of self-drive holidays across the English Channel has soared in the past two years. Nearly a quarter of the UK's 47.4 million adults have gone abroad by car - a total of 11.5 million British holidaymakers. But 80 per cent have been stopped for motoring misdemeanours or picked up a parking ticket - equivalent to 878,000 penalised abroad. The figure does not include Britons fined on fly-drive holidays in hire cars. The survey of 2,054 adults indicated that 4.4 million will set off from home on road trips abroad this year alone - 2.6 million more than in 2012 when just 1.8 million drove to their destination. 24% of the UK's 47.4 million adults have gone abroad by car, it's essential that British travellers get up to speed with little-known local laws in Europe before travelling. It found that men are much more likely to contravene local laws than women - 9 per cent did so compared to 6 per cent of women - and those aged under 25 are the worst offenders. 'There are lots of different laws when you drive in continental Europe and they vary from country to country,' Victoria Walton, Insurance company NFU Mutual's motor insurance specialist, said. SPAIN Fines for driving in flip-flops and ban on using DIY hands-free phone kits at the wheel. FRANCE Fines of up to Euro £1,200 for using a satnav with the speed camera location warning enabled and compulsory to carry a DIY breathalyser. GERMANY Illegal to stop on an autobahn, even when running out of fuel. ITALY Compulsory to park in the direction of traffic on that side of the road and carry spare pair of spectacles if needed for driving. RUSSIA AND BELARUS On-the-spot fine for driving a dirty car. CYPRUS Honking a horn near a hospital prohibited. DENMARK Mandatory to check under car for children hiding before driving off. LUXEMBOURG All cars must have windscreen wipers...even if they don't have a windscreen. SCANDINAVIA First region to make daytime use of headlights compulsory. 'You may not know that it is the law to carry a breathalyser in France, illegal to use a hands-free kit in Spain and compulsory that drivers who wear glasses carry a spare pair in their vehicle in Italy and Spain. 'British tourists are also at risk of serious fines if they drive wearing flip-flops or do not indicate on the motorway in Spain.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said holidaymakers face fines for driving a dirty car in Russia or honking their horn near a hospital in Cyprus and warned that travellers could even be arrested if caught unawares. 'It's easy to throw caution to the wind when on holiday but it's important to be aware of the local laws and customs before you set off,' FCO Minister Mark Simmonds said. 'Laws and customs vary widely from country to country. We want people to enjoy their holidays so we encourage them to be prepared.' Motorists also risk fines for driving without the minimum third party insurance required throughout Europe and advised travellers to check policies to ensure they are covered on the Continent. 'Anyone planning a self-drive trip to Europe this summer must check both their insurance and breakdown cover extends to European travel,' said Walton. 'Some policies do not provide this cover as standard. You risk being seriously out of pocket and, more importantly, breaking the law without the adequate cover.' One in twelve holidaymakers have been stopped for breaking road rules on foreign trips in their own car. The 2011 EU Directive is due to come into force next year after a ruling by the European Court of Justice overturned a UK opt-out. The clampdown gives overseas authorities the go-ahead to electronically access driver records at the DVLA to pursue fines which are currently only enforceable if drivers are stopped by a police officer. Britain fought it on the economic grounds that the cost of upgrading DVLA computers to enable instant exchange of registered keeper details and the expense of processing penalties outweigh the income generated from fines.

Update: Both Starr and McCaw have since departed from Baylor, Starr doing so on June 1 by resigning from his reassigned chancellor position and McCaw resigning on May 30 after the hiring of Jim Grobe as acting head coach.      Baylor University fired head football coach Art Briles on Thursday, stemming from a nearly year-long scandal over how his program handled allegations of player violence against women. But Briles isn't the only powerful person in Waco in trouble.      The university announced, in addition, that president Ken Starr (the former independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton in the 1990s) will give up his role as the school's president at the end of May. He'll continue to serve as a law school chair and as Baylor's chancellor -- a separate position -- under \\"terms that are still being discussed.\\" Baylor athletic director Ian McCaw has been \\"sanctioned and placed on probation.\\"      Briles, officially, is under indefinite suspension with the intent to terminate his contract. The school's report included findings by a third-party law firm that Briles' coaching staff failed to report allegations of player misconduct.      Other members of Baylor's administration have also been dismissed, but the school said it won't identify all of them publicly. Baylor appears prepared to undergo a significant administrative realignment.      This is Baylor's second major athletic scandal since the turn of the century.      McCaw took over as the athletic director in 2003, after a Bears basketball player murdered teammate Patrick Dennehy that summer, along with an attempted cover up by head coach Dave Bliss.      Last July, McCaw told SB Nation in an interview for a separate story that he'd been focused on building bridges while the school tried to move on from that story.      \\"We started closest to home,\\" McCaw said. \\"We needed to reestablish trust with everybody because of what had happened but I think our staff probably was the biggest challenge quite honestly. Because of what happened with the basketball scandal, they felt very violated. We had people we thought we could trust and we were mislead and 'look what's happened to us.' We started closest to home and built it out.\\"      Fostering trust was an important part of McCaw's job.      \\"Trust isn't like a light switch. You don't just flick it on. You have to demonstrate trust by being consistent over a period of time. Once people learn who you are, how you do things, you slowly gain their trust and their confidence,\\" he said. \\"That's what you have to do.\\"      Now, Baylor will have to do it again, and it isn't clear whether McCaw will be a part of it.      \\"We want to be the nation's premier Christian intercollegiate program,\\" McCaw said. \\"That was the vision we cast, that was put into our strategic plan.\\" ||||| Baylor University has demoted president Ken Starr, fired head football coach Art Briles, sanctioned athletic director Ian McCaw, and fired unnamed administrative and athletics department staffers, according to a release from the school. The school also said that an independent investigation found a “fundamental failure by Baylor to implement Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972\\" and a “lack of strong institutional management and control on a number of levels.”      The changes came as a result of an investigation commissioned by law firm Pepper Hamilton, which has spent the past nine months responding to Baylor’s handling of sexual assault claims. According to the university’s statement, Pepper Hamilton did not prepare an actual report; instead the school has synthesized the law firm’s findings into a 13-page Findings of Fact, which you can read here.      Our original story on reports that Art Briles was fired is below.      Original Story      According to a number of local and national media reports, Baylor University will announce the firing of head football coach Art Briles in just a few minutes:      Advertisement      Briles has been at Baylor for nine seasons, amassing a 65-37 record, but during his tenure the program has seen a wave of football players investigated, charged, and in some cases convicted of serious crimes like assault and sexual assault. Last year Baylor hired the law firm Pepper Hamilton to investigate its handling of sexual assault claims, and the Baylor board was given an update of their findings earlier this month.      Advertisement      There have also been reports in the last few days that Baylor president Ken Starr will also be fired, but the University has so far denied those reports. ||||| Texas State Library and Archives CommissionArchive-It Partner Since: Dec, 2006Organization Type: State Archives & LibrariesOrganization URL: http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ The mission of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission is to preserve the record of government for public scrutiny, to secure and make accessible historically significant records and other valuable resources, to meet the reading needs of Texans with disabilities, to build and sustain statewide partnerships to improve library programs and services, and to enhance the capacity for achievement of individuals and institutions with whom we work. ||||| FILE - In this Aug. 5, 2014, file photo,Baylor University President Ken Starr, left, jokes with head football coach Art Briles, right, on the first day of NCAA college football practice in Waco, Texas....

Walter recruits the team, which includes alarms expert Cedric Page (Robert Morley), strong man Hans Fisher (Jess Hahn), and circus acrobat Giulio \\"the Human Fly\\" (Gilles Ségal). Since the museum's floor is completely pressure-alarmed, it will be necessary to lower Giulio by rope from a rooftop window and raise the the heavy glass cover enclosing the mannequin on which the dagger is displayed. Giulio will then replace the dagger with a copy and leave the scene intact in the hope that the theft will not be discovered until the thieves leave the country. This method will require two strong men, Hans and Walter, holding ropes - one to raise the glass cover and the other to hold Giulio.The plan calls for shooting out a searchlight and exploding smoke grenades to distract the guards when the team leaves the museum.

In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: N.E.R.D (stylized as N*E*R*D, a backronym of No-one Ever Really Dies) is an American hip hop and rock band, formed in Virginia Beach, Virginia in 1999. Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo were signed by Teddy Riley to Virgin Records as a duo, The Neptunes. After producing songs for several artists throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the production duo formed the band with Shay Haley as a side project of The Neptunes in 1999. In 2010, N.E.R.D announced the release of their fourth studio album entitled Nothing, which had a scheduled release date for September 7, 2010, but was pushed back to November 2, 2010. The first single from the album, \\"Hot-n-Fun\\" featuring Canadian recording artist Nelly Furtado, was released on May 18, 2010 on iTunes. It was released in the United Kingdom on August 30, 2010.  On August 20, 2010, a track titled \\"Party People\\" leaked onto the internet. It was rumored to be the second single from the album. On September 28, 2010, they premiered another track from the album titled \\"Hypnotize U\\" on Late Show with David Letterman, produced by electronic music duo Daft Punk. On September 30, 2010, in an interview with Mark Hoppus on A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus, Pharrell explained the album cover as \\"a mix of so many things. The feathers represent the peace, and the helmet represents the war. It's like where we are right now. There's a lot of war, that people can't necessarily explain. The economy sucks, girls are still beautiful. We wanted to make music that reflected that. So people can look back twenty years from now, and say 'this is what was going on'\\". They then announced in the interview that the next two singles would be \\"I've Seen the Light\\" and \\"Hypnotize U\\". Pharrell described \\"Hypnotize U\\" as being \\"so different from the rest of the album\\", stating he was \\"very pleased because it serves a different purpose\\" in the album.  On October 17, 2010, the standard edition and the deluxe edition of the album became available for pre-order on iTunes. It was later announced that they would support Gorillaz on the North American leg of their 2010 'Escape to Plastic Beach' world tour. In 2013, Pharrell confirmed a N.E.R.D album was in progress, but also mentioned that the album would not be released that year due to the projects he was working on with other artists. He has also said the album will be \\"nature-based\\". The group reunited on December 26, 2014, to release the songs \\"Squeeze Me,\\" \\"Patrick Star,\\" and \\"Sandy Squirrel\\" for the film The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.

You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Background Paragraph: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.  Story: Brett and Scott were both studying bacteria for their exam. Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while his colleague Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes.  Question: Which student read less about acetogenesis? Output:","output":"Brett"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Help as much as you can. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who Jacquetta Hawkes developed \\"a very great liking?\\"  In 1960, Ronald William Clark published a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public. Two years later, the Papers from the Institute of Archaeology issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler's activities in studying the archaeology of Libya during World War II.

Premise: \\"Noyers is a fortified medieval village with 16 towers in its ramparts.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"There are 16 towers in the ramparts surrounding Noyers.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"Noyers is a fortified medieval village with 16 towers in its ramparts\\" is true, then it provides strong support for the hypothesis \\"There are 16 towers in the ramparts surrounding Noyers.\\" Both the premise and the hypothesis focus on the same core facts – the presence of 16 towers and their location in the ramparts. To better understand the relationship between these statements, let's analyze the components of each. 1. The premise indicates that Noyers is a fortified medieval village. This tells us that the village dates back to the medieval period and features fortifications, which usually include walls or ramparts for protection against attacks or invasions during that era. 2. The premise identifies that there are 16 towers in Noyers' ramparts. This provides specific information about the total number of towers within the village's fortifications. The towers would have had defensive purposes during the medieval period, such as providing vantage points for observation, supporting the walls, and acting as a base for soldiers to defend the village. When looking at the hypothesis, \\"There are 16 towers in the ramparts surrounding Noyers,\\" the core information is consistent with the facts presented in the premise: 1. The hypothesis acknowledges that Noyers has surrounding ramparts. Given that the premise confirms its status as a fortified medieval village, it is logical to assume the presence of ramparts or walls surrounding it.  2. The hypothesis focuses specifically on the number of towers present in the ramparts, stating there are 16. This information matches the details provided in the premise, reinforcing the validity of the claim. Therefore, if the premise is true, it entails that the hypothesis \\"There are 16 towers in the ramparts surrounding Noyers\\" is also true or highly probable. Both statements share foundational information about the presence and number of towers, providing evidence that supports the hypothesis's accuracy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to learn about a very important event that happened in our country. Do you know what the Defense of Marriage Act is? Let's find out! Long ago (in 1996), some people in our country made a law called the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA for short. This law said that marriage could only be between a man and a woman. That meant that two people who love each other like a boy and a girl could get married, but not two boys or two girls who love each other. Many people thought that was not fair, because everyone should have the chance to marry the person they love, even if it is two boys or two girls. So, they asked the Justices for help. The Justices are kind and smart people who help make sure the laws in our country are fair to everyone. They work in a big, fancy building called the Supreme Court. So, the Justices agreed that they would listen to the people and think about whether the Defense of Marriage Act is a good law or not. They all got together and talked about it. And guess what? They decided that DOMA was not fair, because it did not treat everyone the same way. Now, because of the help of the Justices and the hard work of many people, everyone in our country can marry the person they love, whether it is a boy and a girl, two boys, or two girls! Isn't that great news? Love is a very special thing that brings people together, and now everyone has the same chance to show their love through marriage. That is the story of how the Justices heard the case on the Defense of Marriage Act and helped make our country a fairer and happier place for everyone.

After adding spaces, the modified text would be: \\"Plats Self-Catering.\\" Now, let us break down the individual words and provide a detailed meaning for each. 1. Plats: This term is most likely a misspelling or a typo of the word \\"P l a c e s.\\" Assuming this is the case, the term \\"Plats\\" can be replaced by \\"Places,\\" which refers to various locations or destinations. 2. Self-Catering: Self-catering refers to a type of accommodation where guests have the facilities to prepare and cook their meals by themselves. This type of accommodation is popular among travelers or vacationers who prefer having more freedom and independence in their meal choices. Self-catering accommodations generally offer kitchenettes or fully equipped kitchens, enabling guests to cook their meals and save money by not eating out every day. Now that we have added spaces and broken down the terms for better understanding, the final modified text is: \\"Places Self-Catering.\\" This phrase seems to be referring to self-catering accommodations in various locations. These places could include apartments, villas, holiday homes, or cottages that are designed for guests who want to be in charge of their meal arrangements during their stay.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: What is the professor trying to do while being interrupted by the neighboring office?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Marion Post is a New York philosophy professor past the age of 50 on a leave of absence to write a new book.  Due to construction work in their building, she sublets a furnished flat downtown to have peace and quiet. Her work there is interrupted by voices from a neighboring office in the building where a therapist conducts his analysis.  She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman, Hope, who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty.  Her words strike a chord in Marion, who begins to question herself in the same way. She comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness. She also realizes that her marriage to her second husband, Ken, is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend Larry.  She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a Klimt painting called \\"Hope\\".  Although she wants to know more about the woman, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an abortion years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore. She leaves Ken after catching him having an affair. She resolves to change her life for the better, and takes steps to repair her relationship with Paul and Laura.  By the end of the film, she reflects that, for the first time in years, she feels hopeful.

Included tribute to First World War soldiers with knitted poppies.","output":"Title: A Heart-Warming Surprise: Seafront Gardens Bloom in Knit-wear Introduction A sleepy seaside town received a heartwarming surprise over the weekend as locals awoke to find their seafront gardens adorned in colorful knit-work. With every flower, shrub and hanging basket coated in hand-knitted garments, the gesture didn't only add an element of cheer to the town, but also served as a tribute to soldiers from the First World War through the beauty of art. The Knitted Wonderland On a seemingly ordinary day, the residents slowly stepped out of their homes, rubbing their eyes in disbelief as they witnessed the wondrous sight before them. It appeared that a group of dedicated and exceptionally skilled knitters had pulled an all-nighter to create the astonishing display. Rows upon rows of meticulously-crafted crochets covered everything from the tiniest flowers to the largest bushes. It seemed that no plant had been left untouched. The stunning array of colors and intricate designs brought a touch of whimsy and warmth to the seafront area, evoking a sense of childlike enjoyment and amazement among residents and visitors alike. As the day progressed, people of all ages found themselves gathering at the seafront, marveling at the unique and vibrant display. Families, couples, and solo visitors alike basked in the delight of the unexpected art installation and bonded over the joy it created. A Tribute to Fallen Soldiers Further adding to the depth and meaning behind this extraordinary gesture, a section of the gardens had been devoted exclusively to remembering fallen soldiers of the First World War. Here, the anonymous knitters had meticulously crafted an array of knitted poppies, a well-known symbol of remembrance and respect for those who sacrificed their lives for their countries. The beautiful red poppies stood as a poignant tribute to the many heroes who braved the challenges of war to ensure our safety and freedom. The contrast of bright red flowers against the various pastel-colored knits also served as a constant reminder of the importance and weight of their sacrifices. Impact on the Community The anonymous knitters have not only brought a fresh burst of color and joy to the town but have also fostered a strong sense of community among residents. The excitement and buzz in the area have led to lively conversations, new friendships, and even knitting enthusiasts coming together to share their passion for the craft. Locals now are speculating who might be behind this wonderful initiative and how they can keep this sense of camaraderie alive after the knit-work is eventually taken down. The temporary nature of the installation only serves to remind us that beauty, like life itself, can be fleeting. For now, the town can embrace its new-found vibrancy, while paying their respects to the brave soldiers of the past. Conclusion The sudden appearance of the knit-covered seafront gardens brought a sense of wonder and community spirit to the unsuspecting residents of the quaint seaside town. Combining the delicate beauty of nature and the intricacy of hand-crafted art has created a powerful message of unity and remembrance. For now, the town remains abuzz with appreciation for the anonymous knitters who delivered a heartfelt tribute that has touched the hearts of many and rekindled the spirit of gratitude for the sacrifices made by heroes of the First World War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are similar, but not exactly the same. While both questions ask for examples of statutory law, the latter also seeks to understand what statutory laws are. Before diving into the examples, let's briefly clarify what statutory laws are. Statutory laws are written laws enacted by a legislative body, such as the Parliament, Congress, or any other institution with the authority to create legislation. These laws are typically documented in official law codes and serve as a primary source of law in many jurisdictions, governing various areas of life including, but not limited to, criminal, civil, commercial, administrative, and social issues. They are passed in order to uphold community standards, maintain public safety, and protect individual rights. Now, let's go over some examples of statutory law, which will address both questions: 1. Civil Rights Act of 1964 (USA): This groundbreaking law in the United States outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It also ended unequal application of voter registration requirements and prohibited racial segregation in schools, the workplace, and public accommodations. 2. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (USA): Also known as the \\"Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act,\\" this law established new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards, management, and public accounting firms. It was enacted in response to high-profile financial scandals at companies like Enron and WorldCom and aims to improve corporate transparency and financial accountability. 3. The Companies Act 2006 (UK): This act is the primary source of company law in the United Kingdom and provides rules and regulations governing company formation, management, and administration. It includes provisions like the codification of directors’ duties, rights of shareholders, and requirements for annual reports and financial disclosures. 4. Criminal Code Act 1995 (Australia): This act serves as the primary source of criminal law in Australia and covers a broad range of offenses like fraud, bribery, theft, drug offenses, and terrorism, among others. It also establishes general principles of criminal responsibility, such as intention, recklessness, and attempts to commit a crime. 5. The Indian Penal Code, 1860 (India): Enacted during British rule in India, this code provides a comprehensive list of criminal offenses and corresponding punishments in Indian law. It covers offenses such as theft, assault, rape, and murder, as well as offenses against the state, such as sedition, waging war, and promoting enmity between different groups. These examples demonstrate the variety of subject matter that statutory laws can address and their impact on multiple areas of society.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.  - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots  \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek  \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.  - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials.   - Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.  - Hydrazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (also written ). A simple pnictogen hydride, it is a colorless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution. , approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year. Hydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but significant applications also include its uses as a precursor to polymerization catalysts and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion. Anhydrous hydrazine is corrosive towards glass, in a manner similar to hydrofluoric acid.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge  a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals.  - The chalcogens are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the oxygen family. It consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive element polonium (Po). The chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium (Lv) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well. Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term \\"chalcogen\\" altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The word \\"chalcogen\\" is derived from a combination of the Greek word \\"khalks\\" () principally meaning copper (the term was also used for bronze/brass, any metal in the poetic sense, ore or coin), and the Latinised Greek word \\"gens\\", meaning \\"born\\" or \\"produced\\".  - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.  - Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius.  - Chromium trioxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CrO. It is the acidic anhydride of chromic acid, and is sometimes marketed under the same name. This compound is a dark-purple solid under anhydrous conditions, bright orange when wet and which dissolves in water concomitant with hydrolysis. Millions of kilograms are produced annually, mainly for electroplating. Chromium trioxide is a powerful oxidiser and a suspected carcinogen.  - Pollucite is a zeolite mineral with the formula (Cs,Na)AlSiO·2HO with iron, calcium, rubidium and potassium as common substituting elements. It is important as a significant ore of caesium and sometimes rubidium. It forms a solid solution series with analcime. It crystallizes in the isometric - hexoctahedral crystal system as colorless, white, gray, or rarely pink and blue masses. Well formed crystals are rare. It has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.9. It has a brittle fracture and no cleavage.  - The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, HCrO of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent.  - Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula HSO and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol.  - Caesium or cesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold (or, according to some, silver/colorless) alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at 116 °C (177 °F). It is the least electronegative element. It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite, while the radioisotopes, especially caesium-137, a fission product, are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors.  - Rust is an iron oxide, usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides FeO·\\"n\\"HO and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)).  - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.  - Caesium chromate , the caesium salt of chromic acid , is used to produce caesium vapour by reaction with silicon , boron , or titanium , which is used to in the final stages of creating vacuum tubes ; the caesium vapour reacts with the remaining gases , including nitrogen and oxygen .  - Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).  - Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin \\"\\", derived from the Greek \\"\\" (literally \\"shiny\\" or \\"white\\"), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *\\"her-\\", \\"grey\\" or \\"shining\\". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\\"native silver\\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is more abundant than gold, but it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \\"0.940 fine\\".   - Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine.  - Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.  - Aqua regia (\\"royal water\\" or \\"king's water\\") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid. Aqua regia was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum. However, aqua regia does not dissolve or corrode silver, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, rhenium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, osmium, or rhodium.  - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.  - Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with an atomic mass of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive Rb, with a half-life of 49 billion yearsmore than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe.  - Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free (elemental) state.  - Borax, also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate, is an important boron compound, a mineral, and a salt of boric acid. Powdered borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water.  - Kernite, also known as rasorite is a hydrated sodium borate hydroxide mineral with formula . It is a colorless to white mineral crystallizing in the monoclinic crystal system typically occurring as prismatic to acicular crystals or granular masses. It is relatively soft with Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and light with a specific gravity of 1.91. It exhibits perfect cleavage and a brittle fracture.

How is \\"Your stomach's going round to meet itself behind your back. Bullshit.\\" said in Czech?","output":"To translate the phrase \\"Your stomach's going round to meet itself behind your back. Bullshit.\\" into Czech, I will perform the following steps: 1. Understand the meaning of the given phrase: The phrase seems to imply that someone is very hungry or has not eaten in a while, and is likely annoyed or frustrated. The word \\"bullshit\\" is likely used as an exclamation or to disbelieve what someone is saying. 2. Break down the sentence into parts: The sentence contains two parts:  - \\"Your stomach's going round to meet itself behind your back\\": This is a figurative expression which refers to extreme hunger.  - \\"Bullshit\\": This is a slang term that is used to express disbelief or disapproval. 3. Translate the parts individually: - \\"Your stomach's going round to meet itself behind your back\\": In Czech, this figurative expression doesn't have a direct equivalent, so we need to find an expression conveying the meaning of extreme hunger. A Czech expression for extreme hunger is \\"mít hlad jako vlk\\", which means \\"to be hungry as a wolf\\". - \\"Bullshit\\": In Czech, the appropriate slang term for expressing disbelief or disapproval is \\"nesmysl\\", which means \\"nonsense\\" or \\"rubbish\\". 4. Combine the translated parts: Now that we have the translated parts, we can combine them into a complete sentence in Czech: \\"mít hlad jako vlk. nesmysl\\" 5.

Though both questions are related to politics and elections in India, they are asking about different elections and the factors that may influence their outcomes. Let's analyze the two questions to understand their differences. 1. Who will win in the BMC elections 2017, SS, BJP, Congress, MNS, or AAP? This question is specific to the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) elections that took place in 2017 in Mumbai, India. The BMC is responsible for civic infrastructure and administration in the city of Mumbai. The question is regarding the prospects of five major political parties - the Shiv Sena (SS), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian National Congress (Congress), Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) - in those elections. 2. Will the demonetization move help BJP to win the UP elections of 2017? This question is about the Uttar Pradesh (UP) Legislative Assembly elections that occurred in 2017. Unlike the previous question, this one is specifically focused on the role of demonetization in influencing the outcome of the UP elections. Demonetization refers to the Indian government's decision to withdraw high-denomination currency notes in November 2016, effectively rendering them non-legal tender. The question seeks to explore whether this move had any positive bearing on BJP's chances of winning the UP elections. To summarize, the two questions cannot be considered the same. They pertain to different elections held in different regions of India, with the first question focusing on the major parties contesting the BMC elections, while the second question aims to understand the potential impact of the demonetization policy on BJP's performance in the UP elections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: What is the spatial device Bacon continued to incorporate and used many times throughout his career?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing. I think perhaps the drink helped me to... The answer is:","output":"The spatial device that Francis Bacon continued to incorporate and used many times throughout his career is the three lines radiating from the central figure. This spatial device was first seen in his painting Crucifixion, 1933, and it became a characteristic element in many of his works. The use of the three radiating lines helped to create a sense of depth and space around the central figure, focusing the viewer's attention on the subject while maintaining the abstract and expressive nature of his artworks. This technique showcases Bacon's innovative approach to art, combining both formal and expressive elements to communicate powerful emotions and concepts through his paintings. Throughout his career, Bacon continued to develop and refine this spatial device, further establishing his unique artistic style and contributing to his reputation as a significant figure in 20th-century art."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a premise: \\"A boy wearing an arm cast lying in a hospital bed\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The boy was recently injured.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"While the premise does not explicitly confirm the hypothesis as true, it does provide a strong basis for making an educated inference about the situation. Let's examine the premise and hypothesis more closely to understand their relationship. Premise: \\"A boy wearing an arm cast lying in a hospital bed\\" From this statement, we can gather some key pieces of information: 1. The subject is a boy. 2. The boy has an arm cast. 3. The boy is lying in a hospital bed. Hypothesis: \\"The boy was recently injured.\\" This hypothesis postulates that the reason behind the boy's current state is due to a recent injury. When we look at the premise, we see that the boy has an arm cast which could indicate that he has suffered an injury that required medical treatment, resulting in his current situation. Furthermore, the fact that he is lying in a hospital bed strengthens this idea, as patients are generally admitted into hospitals when they need medical care, treatment, or observation for their health issues or injuries. However, it is important to note that while there is a strong possibility that the hypothesis is true based on the premise, we cannot definitively say so. There could be alternative reasons for the boy's arm cast or hospital stay. For instance, he might have a medical condition that requires the immobilization of his arm, or he could be at the hospital to visit someone else and coincidentally have an arm cast. In conclusion, while the premise significantly supports the hypothesis that the boy was recently injured, it does not provide concrete evidence to declare the hypothesis as true. We cannot confirm the hypothesis entirely without additional context or information. However, based on the available information in the premise, it is reasonable to infer that the boy's arm cast and hospital stay are most likely the result of a recent injury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which city had more people exposed to outdoor pollution? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Twin City had increased air pollution, and its people experienced all kinds of respiratory diseases. This suggests that more people in Twin City were exposed to outdoor pollution compared to those in Pine City, where the health problems were mainly related to age-related diseases.  The air pollution in Twin City likely resulted from human actions such as industrial production, vehicle emissions, construction, and other activities releasing harmful chemical substances and particles into the air. As a consequence, the outdoor air quality in Twin City was poor, affecting the respiratory health of the people living there. The prevalence of respiratory diseases among the population indicates that many people were exposed to outdoor pollution in that area. On the other hand, Pine City had problems with age-related diseases, but there was no mention of pollution or air quality issues in the provided information. It is possible that the outdoor pollution levels in Pine City were lower than those in Twin City since the primary health issues reported in Pine City were not pollution-related. In conclusion, Twin City had more people exposed to outdoor pollution than Pine City, as evidenced by the prevalence of respiratory diseases and increased air pollution in Twin City compared to the age-related health problems in Pine City."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this and answer the question Thermally, a temperate glacier is at melting point throughout the year, from its surface to its base. The ice of a polar glacier is always below freezing point from the surface to its base, although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting. A sub-polar glacier includes both temperate and polar ice, depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier. In a similar way, the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by the temperature at its base alone. A cold-based glacier is below freezing at the ice-ground interface, and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate. A warm-based glacier is above or at freezing at the interface, and is able to slide at this contact. This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively erode its bed, as sliding ice promotes plucking at rock from the surface below. Glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as polythermal. From where is the temperature of a glacier measured?","output":"The temperature of a glacier is typically measured at various points along its length, depth, and at its base. A more specific way to describe the thermal regime of a glacier is by the temperature at its base alone, which is the ice-ground interface. This is because the temperature at the base greatly influences the glacier's overall behavior, like its sliding mechanism and its ability to erode the bedrock. In general, a glacier's temperature can be categorized into temperate, polar, sub-polar, cold-based, or warm-based depending on the specific measurement points and the characteristic temperature distribution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Armenians have had a continuous documented presence in Cyprus since 578 AD: according to historian Theophylact Simocatta, during his campaign against the Persian King Chosroes I, Byzantine General Maurice the Cappadocian captured 10,090 Armenians as prisoners in Arzanene, of whom about 3,350 were deported to Cyprus. More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor Heraclius for political reasons and also during the pontificate of Catholicos Hovhannes III Odznetsi for commercial reasons. Flowing on, after the end of Arab raids in Cyprus, more arrived by the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere who undertook the construction of Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an Armenian Apostolic church in the 10th century and was used by Armenian-Catholics during the Latin Era as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos Khatchig I established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia. Relations between Cyprus and the Armenians became closer when the Kingdom of Cilicia was established. Between 1136-1138, Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus moved the entire population of the Armenian city of Tell Hamdun to Cyprus. After Isaac Comnenus' wedding to the daughter of the Armenian prince Thoros II in 1185, Armenian nobles and warriors came with him to Cyprus, many of whom defended the island against Richard the Lionheart, when he landed in Limassol. Question: Which happened first, the establishment of the Armenian Bishopric or the wedding of Isaac Comnenus? Answer:","output":"The establishment of the Armenian Bishopric happened first. The Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia was established in 973 by Catholicos Khatchig I. Later, Isaac Comnenus' wedding to the daughter of the Armenian prince Thoros II took place in 1185. So the Bishopric was established earlier than the wedding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Article: The story below is a true story that happened in September. During the month of September, a dear friend of mine lost her husband suddenly in an accident. The _ was a great shock to everyone. This accident was sudden and certainly unexpected. It made me realize the fact that you just don't know when a loved one is no longer going to be with you. We sometimes take our loved ones for granted ,and we expect that they will be with us all the time. However, as we all know, life does not work that way and sometimes we get a wake-up call that shocks us and makes us stand back and realize how short life is. To cheer her up, I tried to imagine if I were in her shoes how I would feel. It was impossible to imagine what she was going through. What words could I say to help her?Sometimes words just can't express our feelings. Sometimes our actions are much more meaningful than words. So I gave her a hug ... Life is too short, and we should treasure  every day staying with our loved ones. Question: In the writer's opinion, life for us is   _  . Options: A: short B: serious C: unexpected D: meaningless A:","output":"The correct answer, based on the context provided in the article, is likely to be A: Short. The author often reiterates the fleeting nature of life throughout the article, particularly through the use of phrases such as \\"you just don't know when a loved one is no longer going to be with you\\", \\"realize how short life is\\", and \\"Life is too short\\". Option B: Serious, could be a potential answer as the article does deal with a serious topic, losing a loved one. However, the author doesn't explicitly state or particularly emphasize on how serious life is, making it a less fitting option. Option C: Unexpected, is another plausible choice as the article speaks about the unexpected loss of a dear friend's husband. However, it seems the unexpected aspect is mainly utilized to illuminate the unpredictability of life rather than as a general characterization of life itself. Option D: Meaningless, is the least fitting choice as the author displays sentiments of cherishing life and the moments with our loved ones, directly contradicting the notion of life being meaningless. Instead of presenting life as devoid of value, the author urges the readers to value and treasure every day with their loved ones, implying that life, according to the author, is filled with meaning and worth. So, based on the context provided and the tone of the author in the article, the most fitting choice is A: Short, as it directly complements the author's message regarding the fleeting and impermanent nature of life and the importance of cherishing each moment we have with our loved ones."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this article, we will guide you step by step in crafting the perfect Chocolate Mint Martini, from chilling your glass to adding the finishing touches of whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and a mint leaf. Let's get started! Step 1: Chill the Martini Glass The first step in creating a flawless Chocolate Mint Martini is to ensure that your glass is adequately chilled. Place your martini glass in the freezer or refrigerator for at least 15 minutes before making your cocktail. This simple step will add an extra touch of class and ensure that your drink stays cold for longer. Step 2: Fill a Cocktail Shaker with Ice Next, take a cocktail shaker and fill it with ice to about halfway. Using a sufficient quantity of ice in the shaker ensures that your cocktail is cold and properly mixed. Step 3: Add Ingredients to the Cocktail Shaker Now, it's time to bring the flavors together. Add the following ingredients to your shaker: - Vodka: The vodka provides a strong base for the drink and complements the sweet and refreshing flavors of the other ingredients. - Crème de Cocoa: This chocolate-flavored liqueur adds a rich and indulgent chocolate taste to the martini. - Crème de Menthe: This mint-flavored liqueur infuses the drink with a refreshing and cooling mint flavor, perfectly balancing the sweetness of the chocolate. - Half-and-Half: This blend of equal parts milk and cream gives the cocktail a delightful creaminess, smoothing out the flavors and adding a touch of luxury. Step 4: Shake the Cocktail Shaker After adding all ingredients to the shaker, securely close the lid and shake vigorously for 15 to 20 seconds. Shaking the mixture ensures proper aeration, blending, and chilling, resulting in a consistency and flavor that are sure to impress. Step 5: Strain and Pour the Mixture Take your chilled martini glass, remove the lid from the shaker, attach a strainer, and pour the mixture into the glass. This step separates the ice from the actual drink, ensuring a perfect pour. Step 6: Garnish the Martini Finally, it's time to add the finishing touches that elevate the Chocolate Mint Martini to a true work of art. Garnish your drink with a dollop of whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and a fresh mint leaf. This not only enhances the visual appeal of the cocktail but also adds contrasting textures and flavors that make each sip even more enjoyable. Conclusion: The Chocolate Mint Martini is a drink that exudes elegance and indulgence. The combination of vodka, crème de cocoa, and crème de menthe, with its creamy texture and delightful garnishes, creates a cocktail that is as beautiful as it is delicious.

Please answer the following question: When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour.

Albrechtstraße Answer:","output":"Title: Mystery on Albrechtstraße Genre: Mystery, Thriller, Drama Setting: The story takes place in modern-day Berlin, Germany, focusing on Albrechtstraße – a famous street lined with grand residential buildings and a palpable sense of history. This street is representative of the blend between the old and the new, with architecture from different eras standing side-by-side.  Plot: Act 1: - Introduce the protagonist, Elisa Schmidt, a 30-year-old investigative journalist who has just inherited a large, historical house on Albrechtstraße from her estranged grandfather. Elisa has fond memories of her grandfather, who was rumored to have been involved in various illegal activities during his life. - Elisa moves into the house and starts to notice strange occurrences, particularly in the attic and the secret underground tunnel beneath the house. Her curiosity is piqued, and she decides to delve deeper into the past and secrets of the house. - Introduce a supporting character, Dr. Lukas Richter, a historian and professor at a local university who specializes in the history of Berlin architecture. Elisa seeks his help to uncover the truth about the house and her grandfather's past.      Act 2: - Elisa and Lukas work together to unravel the mysteries of the house. They discover that the house has a dark history dating back to World War II. It was used as a hub for a secret resistance group that was working against the Nazi regime. The house, with its hidden rooms and tunnels, was pivotal in facilitating covert communication and operations. - The plot thickens when Elisa finds her grandfather's secret diary, which reveals his involvement with the resistance group. It becomes clear that not only did her grandfather play an instrumental role in the group, but he also hid a valuable artifact that is now being sought by a criminal organization.   - Elisa and Lukas are tasked to find the artifact before it falls into the wrong hands. As they follow a series of clues and riddles left by her grandfather, they are pursued by dangerous individuals who are determined to seize the house and the hidden artifact.  Act 3: - The climax of the story revolves around an intense chase through the underground tunnels beneath the Albrechtstraße. Elisa and Lukas struggle both mentally and physically to outwit their pursuers and locate the artifact. - Eventually, the duo discovers the artifact hidden in the depths of the tunnel – an ancient, priceless manuscript containing key information about the top-secret plans of the Nazi regime. It becomes crucial for them to protect this significant piece of history and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. - In a final showdown, Elisa and Lukas are cornered by the antagonists. Just when everything seems lost, they manage to outsmart the criminals and escape with the artifact.          Epilogue: - Elisa and Lukas, having developed a strong bond throughout the investigation, decide to donate the artifact to a historical museum to preserve it for future generations. Their journey has also led them to understand the importance of their own history and the sacrifices that have shaped their lives.  - The house on Albrechtstraße becomes a monument to the bravery of those who fought against tyranny. Through Elisa's work, the house serves as a symbol of the importance of preserving history and remembering the past. And as for Elisa, she continues her career in investigative journalism, embracing her newfound sense of purpose and the passion she discovered while solving the mystery on Albrechtstraße."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How to boost your resume  Review your existing resume.  Look for any gaps or weak areas that you see right away. Check to see if you have at least one item listed in all of the following key areas: experience, education, skills, volunteer work. Available choices:  a). If you are lacking in any of these areas then target that area and commit to doing good work to enhance it. If you are unsure of what area needs improvement then ask someone you trust for advice.;  b). If you have experience, then you have an excellent resume. If the contact information for a high school you've worked for has shifted and you haven't completed your senior year within one year, you may have a few choices when it comes to targeting your own company as a career path.;  c). Find a writing sample that says a few things about you if you did not at all rewrite it to reflect it in the following section. Make sure you have at least a few internships in which you have signed uploads.;  d). If you have some experience working in any of the following areas, go ahead and use these instead : Written graphic design experience level of expertise experience Consider opening an email account. If you are beginning to think about starting a new resume, you may still consider opening an email account.;","output":"Boosting your resume involves strengthening important areas such as experience, education, skills, and volunteer work. Here are some detailed steps you can take depending on your current circumstances: a) If your resume is lacking in any of these areas, then focus on enhancing that particular area. For instance, if your skills section is sparse, consider enrolling in short courses to add to your skill sets. You could also volunteer in organizations where you can exercise and refine those particular skills. It is crucial to to get perspective on areas of improvement; you can ask mentors, professors, friends, or career advisors for their input. Taking their advice into consideration could provide valuable insight into how potential employers might perceive your resume.  b) If you have plenty of experience but have an outdated section such as contact information for a high school, revise it to reflect your recent educational or professional experiences instead. Remember, a successful career path often involves continuous learning and development. Show this commitment by listing any pertinent extra courses you've taken or any seminars you've attended. Keep your resume up-to-date with the latest industry demands or trends in your field. c) Including writing samples can be a great way to showcase your communication skills, especially if your job would involve significant amounts of writing. Whether it's a published blog post, an article you've written, or a report from a previous job, make sure it's relevant to your career and displays your competence. Convert your writing samples into PDFs if possible, as this format preserves the document’s formatting across various platforms. Black ink is easiest on the eyes and the most professional color choice. d) If your experience includes working in niche areas or industries, you can highlight this as a unique selling point. For instance, if you've had graphic design experiences, create a portfolio section in your resume where you can enumerate the projects you've worked with. This gives employers proof of your expertise. If you're looking to start a new resume, consider opening a professional email account that you use specifically for job applications. This allows potential employers to easily and professionally contact you. Aside from these points, remember to make your resume visually appealing. Use a structured layout, consistent headings, bullets points and maintain a uniform font and text size. Keep the language simple, concise, and jargon-free to the best extent possible. Use active verbs and quantify your achievements whenever possible.  After making these improvements, it is essential to review and revise. Have someone else proofread it for you to get an outside perspective. You can also read it out loud to yourself or use grammar checking tools to catch any awkward phrasing or typos. Ultimately, your aim should be to create a resume that accurately and positively represents you as a potential employee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On a warm Friday evening, they decided to meet up for dinner at their favorite restaurant, 'Wholesome Delights', which was well-known for its variety of delicious vegetable dishes. Upon entering the quaint little restaurant, they were greeted by the warm and friendly staff who led them to their reserved table near the big windows, where they could enjoy both their meal and the lovely view of the park outside. As they sat down, they began perusing the menu, trying to decide what to order. Steven's eyes lit up when he saw the squash soup on the menu, \\"Oh, I simply must have this! You know how much I love squash, right, William?\\" he said, delighted with his choice. William just rolled his eyes, grinning at his friend's enthusiasm. \\"Yes, I know,\\" he replied, \\"But you also know how much I dislike it.\\" \\"Fair enough,\\" Steven conceded, taking a sip of his water. \\"What are you planning to order?\\" William scanned through the menu before he came across the broccoli casserole with crispy onion topping. He had heard raving reviews about this dish from his colleagues and was excited to give it a try. \\"I think I'll go with the broccoli casserole. Want to share?\\" he suggested, knowing that despite their differences in preference, their bond was marked by compromise. Steven thought about it for a moment and then shrugged. \\"Sure, why not? Let's share the dishes. As long as there's squash involved, I'm game!\\" They waved the waiter over, and both Steven and William placed their orders. As they waited for their food, they discussed the busy week they had gone through and their plans for the weekend. Laughter echoed throughout the restaurant as their stories of office mishaps had the duo in stitches. Finally, their dishes arrived - a steaming bowl of squash soup and the much-awaited broccoli casserole, which looked even more enticing than they expected. William couldn't help but take a deep breath, inhaling the delicious scent of the nicely browned, crispy onion topping covering the layers of broccoli and creamy cheese sauce. Both friends eagerly dug into their meals, savoring the mix of flavors that their chosen dishes offered. Although Steven was initially skeptical about the broccoli casserole, the first bite made him a convert. \\"Oh, William, this is fantastic! I'm glad you talked me into sharing it.\\" William smiled, equally pleased with his selection. \\"I knew you'd like it,\\" he replied. However, he wasn't quite as taken with the squash soup, but he appreciated the smoothness and creaminess of the dish, understanding why his friend loved it so dearly. The evening continued with the same warmth and camaraderie that had defined their friendship, right from their college days. As they polished off their plates, both friends couldn't help but appreciate the other's company, the tasty meal, and the joy of simple pleasures. As the evening drew to a close, they split the check and walked out into the pleasant breeze, planning their next dinner adventure. And as they left, they couldn't help but be grateful for the friendship they shared, one that transcended their differences, even when it came to squash and broccoli."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was almost shot after being identified? , can you please find it?   Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death\\". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran under the Human Rights Act 1998. He now lives in Peckham, south London, having assumed another identity. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who was almost shot after being identified is Nejad.

Almost from the word go this film is poor and lacking conviction but then again most people would struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring as this. The dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less (or should have been). This is also backed-up by odd scenes (e.g. the Cemetry slow-motion walk) that you think might lead somewhere but only seem to waste a few more seconds of your life.

Mit einer Audio Doppel CD und vorliegendem 3 – DVD Set blicken die eisernen Jungfrauen auf ihre „Dance of Death“ World Tour 2003 zurück. Mitgefilmt wurde die Show in der Dortmunder Westfalenhalle und aufgrund der Datenmenge entschieden sich die Macher Steve Harris und Kevin Shirley dafür das Konzert zweimal in das Package zu stopfen. So bekommt man quasi auf Disc 1 das Konzert in Stereo Sound und auf Disc 2 in 5.1. Dolby Digital und DTS Sound. Gute Sache! Die Show mit der Burg Dekoration war schon der Hammer. Da kommen neue Stracks wie „Dance of Death“ oder „Paschendale“ (beide von Bruce Dickinson mit Kostümen und Masken auch optisch unterstützt) richtig fett und geil rüber. Wenn Klassiker Alarm angesagt ist wechseln die Backdrops zum jeweiligen Artwork von „The Trooper“, „Run to the Hills“, etc.! Auch wird mit „Lord of the Flies“ ein Stück aus der Blaze Bayley Ära gebracht und beim genialen „Journeyman“ die Accoustic Klampfen ausgepackt. Nur noch Bestens – 17 Tracks die in perfekter Qualität (auch was Kamera, Bildschnitt und Ton betrifft) dargeboten werden und jeden Maiden Maniac in Entzückung bringen, da der gute alte Eddie ja auch zweimal zum Einsatz (auf der Bühne jagt er Janick Gers und hinter Nicko Mc. Brain´s Drumset taucht er als Gevatter Tod mit Sense auf) kommt. Die dritte Disc bietet massig Bonus, es wird ausführlich über Album und Tour schwadroniert (75 Min.) und es gibt auch ein Special in dem die witzige, aber auch sehr fleißige Crew zu Wort kommt (45 Min.). Ein weiteres Special widmet sich den Fans, die vor einem England Gig befragt wurden. Da gibt es ganze Maiden Familienausflüge wo Daddy seine Kids (standesgemäß im Eddie Shirt) mitbringt! Nur noch cool und ca. 30Min. lang. Ein weiteres EPK (15 Min.) und die „Wildest Dreams“ und „Rainmaker“ Clips mit Making Of Reportagen so wie endlose Foto und Tourdate Gallerien lassen das Package nie enden. Man kann zig Stunden mit diesem Teil zubringen und da es auch noch in einem netten Digipack mit Farb Booklet steckt kann man an dieser Stelle nur eine absolute Kaufempfehlung aussprechen. Doch von einer Weltklasse Band haben wir ja nichts anderes erwartet, oder?
