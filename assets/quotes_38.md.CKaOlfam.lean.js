The researchers suggest that meditation could be used as a complementary therapy for people with depression.","output":"Meditation is an ancient practice that has been shown to have numerous benefits for both the mind and body. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using meditation as a complementary therapy for mental health conditions such as depression. A new study has now confirmed that regular meditation practice can indeed help to reduce symptoms of depression. The study, which involved over 2,000 participants, found that those who meditated regularly had lower rates of depression and anxiety. The researchers suggest that meditation can be a useful tool in the treatment of depression, particularly for those who are seeking non-pharmaceutical options. They also stress that meditation should not be seen as a replacement for other treatments, but rather as a complementary therapy that can be used in combination with other interventions. One of the main reasons that meditation is thought to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression is that it helps to regulate emotions. Meditation has been shown to increase activity in areas of the brain that are responsible for regulating emotions, such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. By strengthening these areas of the brain, it is thought that meditation can help to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Another way in which meditation may be helpful is by promoting relaxation and reducing stress. Stress is a major contributing factor to many mental health conditions, including depression. By promoting relaxation and reducing stress, meditation may help to prevent or reduce symptoms of depression. Of course, as with any complementary therapy, it is important to speak with a qualified health professional before starting a meditation practice. Meditation may not be appropriate for everyone, and it is important to ensure that it is used safely and effectively. In conclusion, the latest research confirms that meditation can be a useful tool in the treatment of depression. By promoting emotional regulation and reducing stress, meditation may help to prevent or reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. If you are looking for non-pharmaceutical options for the management of depression, meditation may be worth considering."},{"instruction":"Confirming our meeting at 3 pm today","output":"Confirmed."},{"instruction":"After finishing his book, Mark decided to write his own novel.

The quadratic formula is x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. To solve the same equation as above, we can apply the quadratic formula with a=1, b=5, and c=6, and obtain x = -2 or x = -3.

The research, which surveyed thousands of adults over a period of several years, found that participants who consistently got less than seven hours of sleep per night were at greater risk for developing heart disease. The findings of the study suggest that getting 7-8 hours of sleep per night is optimal for reducing the risk of heart disease.

In light of these results, researchers are recommending that individuals take steps to improve their quality and quantity of sleep. This includes practicing good sleep hygiene, such as establishing a regular sleep routine, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, and avoiding screens in the hour leading up to bedtime.

Dog owners have a responsibility to properly train and care for their pets.","output":"Dogs have long held a special place in the hearts of humans. They are loyal, loving, and always there to offer companionship and emotional support. But the benefits of having a dog go far beyond just their comforting presence. Different breeds of dogs have various strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different roles. For example, German Shepherds are often used as police or guard dogs due to their intelligence and instinctual protective nature. Golden Retrievers, on the other hand, are known for their ability to be trained as therapy dogs and bring comfort to those in hospitals or nursing homes. Bulldogs are great family pets due to their affectionate nature and low-energy personality. However, owning a dog is not just about finding the right breed for a particular job. It comes with a significant responsibility to properly train and care for our furry friends. This responsibility includes providing a loving and safe environment, providing proper nutrition and exercise, and seeking medical attention when necessary. Training a dog is also crucial, not only for the dog's well-being but for the safety of others around them. Dogs that are poorly behaved can cause harm to themselves or others. Proper training includes basic commands such as \\"sit\\" and \\"stay,\\" as well as obedience training to ensure the dog understands their place in the household. In conclusion, dogs are truly man's best friend, offering companionship and emotional support to those who need it most. But, as dog owners, we have a responsibility to care for them properly, including finding the right breed for our needs, providing a safe home, and proper training. By doing so, we can ensure that our beloved pets are happy and healthy members of our families."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about this data: The Eagle customer rating low; The Eagle eatType pub; The Eagle priceRange less than £20; The Eagle familyFriendly no","output":"The Eagle is a non-family-friendly pub with a low customer rating and a price range less than £20."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following conclusion from the context?

During the light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by pigment molecules (such as chlorophyll) and is used to produce ATP (a type of energy molecule) and NADPH (a molecule that carries energized electrons). These molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions, where carbon dioxide is converted into glucose. Photosynthesis is incredibly important to plants because it provides the energy and necessary materials for growth and survival.

Feedback from others can be incredibly helpful and provide you with a different perspective on your learning journey.

The study found that those who listened to music for at least 45 minutes before bedtime reported better sleep quality, a longer duration of sleep, and fewer instances of waking up at night. The research also revealed that classical music was the most effective genre of music for inducing sleep, followed closely by new age music. While the study did not delve into the exact physiological mechanisms behind music's sleep-inducing effects, the researchers postulated that music is capable of relaxing the mind and body and reducing the stress accumulated during the day. Additionally, the slow rhythm and melodic nature of classical music could activate the parasympathetic nervous system, decreasing heart rate and promoting relaxation. Therefore, implementing a short routine of music listening before bed could be a simple yet effective approach to improve sleep quality and duration, especially for older adults.

The resulting free oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the hydrogen ions are used to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that stores energy. Carbon dioxide is then taken in from the air and combined with the hydrogen ions and electrons to create glucose.

Solar energy: Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity. The solar panels are made up of photovoltaic (PV) cells, which absorb sunlight and generate an electrical current. The electricity produced can either be used immediately or stored in batteries for future use. 2. Wind energy: Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of wind into electricity. The blades of the turbine spin when they are hit by wind, which turns a generator and generates electricity. Wind energy can be used in wind farms or in individual homes. 3. Hydroelectric energy: Hydroelectric power plants generate electricity by harnessing the energy from flowing water. Water is stored in large reservoirs and then released through turbines, which generate electricity. The amount of electricity produced depends on the volume and speed of the water flow."},{"instruction":"Paul went for a run in the park. He wore his running shoes and shorts.

At its inception, the Eiffel Tower was a controversial structure. Some Parisians considered it an eyesore and opposed its construction, while others saw it as a symbol of national pride and modernity. Gustave Eiffel himself considered the tower a scientific and engineering marvel, and viewed it as a way to showcase French technological advancements. At the time of its construction, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world, and held that title for over 40 years. It was also considered an architectural masterpiece, with its intricate lattice design and utilization of new construction techniques, such as the use of wrought iron. Today, the Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. Its cultural significance stems from its symbolism as a representation of French culture and heritage. The tower is a popular backdrop for countless films, photographs, and works of art, and has become a symbol of romance and love in popular culture. In addition to its cultural significance, the Eiffel Tower has also served as a beacon of hope during times of tragedy.

The reasons behind this potential move are to create a healthier online environment and eliminate the negative impacts of social media on individuals and society. One of the primary reasons for removing the \\"like\\" button is the mental health of social media users. Studies have shown that people tend to obsess over the number of likes their posts receive, which often leads to low self-esteem and anxiety. By removing the \\"like\\" button, users can be relieved of this pressure and may feel more at ease sharing their thoughts and experiences on the platform. Another reason behind this move is to prevent social media addiction. Social media can be addictive, and the \\"like\\" button is often a reward mechanism that keeps users scrolling and refreshing their feeds. Without the \\"like\\" button, the platform may become less addictive, leading to less time spent on social media and better mental health. Finally, eliminating the \\"like\\" button could help prevent the spread of misinformation and fake news. Social media users often like and share posts without reading or verifying their content. By removing the \\"like\\" button, users may be prompted to read and think critically about the content they are viewing, leading to a more informed and educated society. If a major social media platform decides to remove their \\"like\\" button, it could change the way people interact online. Users may be encouraged to spend more time engaging with content and creating deeper connections rather than just scrolling and liking posts.

However, the actual construction of the Great Wall was started by several of China's early dynasties during times of political and social instability, as protection against invading armies. The construction of the Great Wall was a massive undertaking, requiring hundreds of thousands of workers over several centuries. The wall is constructed from a variety of materials, including brick, tamped earth, and stone. Initially, the wall was built using local materials, with more durable materials such as brick and stone being used later on. The wall was reinforced with buttresses and watchtowers, which were used as lookout points for the military garrisons stationed along the wall. There have been many additions and modifications to the Great Wall over the years. During the Ming Dynasty, the wall was almost completely rebuilt and expanded to its current form. It was during this period that many of the watchtowers and fortresses were constructed, as well as the famous beacon towers that were used to transmit signals across long distances. Despite its impressive size and historic importance, the Great Wall was not always effective in preventing invaders from entering China. In fact, the wall was breached several times over the years, most notably by the Mongols under the leadership of Genghis Khan. Today, the Great Wall of China remains one of the world's most popular tourist attractions, drawing millions of visitors each year to admire this amazing feat of engineering and construction.

The move is aimed at opening new markets and improving the airline's market share. While travelers may appreciate the increased accessibility, some experts remain cautious about the long-term impact of the expansion. One group that is optimistic about the development is the business community. The opening of new routes is seen as a boost to the local economy, with the potential to create jobs and stimulate economic activity. This can have a ripple effect on other sectors of the economy, too, like restaurants, hotels, and retail, which could see an uptick in business. Analysts have also noted that the growth in the airline industry generally has benefited overall economic growth. A report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that aviation contributed 2.7 trillion to the global economy in 2019, and supported around 65 million jobs worldwide. Local economies stand to benefit from such growth, especially in regions with tourism potential or those that have large manufacturing/export industries. Despite the potential benefits, there are concerns that the expansion may come at a cost to the environment. Critics have pointed out that the aviation industry has always had a high carbon footprint, contributing to air pollution and climate change. More planes in the skies would mean higher greenhouse gas emissions, which would counteract efforts to reduce carbon emissions and air pollution. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) estimates that aviation accounts for around 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions. While the industry has attempted to reduce its ecological impact by improving fuel efficiency and investing in projects that capture and offset emissions, the pace of change needs to be faster to meet targets. In conclusion, the expansion of airline routes is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it has the potential to stimulate local economies, but on the other hand, the negative environmental impact cannot be overlooked. The aviation industry and governments must work together to mitigate the ecological cost while still ensuring growth in the industry."},{"instruction":"f The company's profit has increased by 30%. is true, can we say that The profit of the company has experienced a 30% increase.?

Investors are feeling optimistic about the future, buoyed by hopes that widespread distribution of vaccines will bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerate global economic growth. In addition to vaccine optimism, strong earnings reports from tech companies are also boosting markets. Several major tech companies have reported better-than-expected earnings in recent weeks, reflecting the sustained demand for digital products and services during the pandemic-era. However, it is worth noting that experts are warning of potential market volatility ahead. The economic fallout from the pandemic and the accompanying lockdowns has been severe, and some analysts have expressed concern that rising unemployment and mounting debt could trigger a recession in the coming months. Furthermore, global geopolitical tensions and the ongoing trade disputes between major economic powers could potentially derail the current market rally. Despite these risks, the mood among investors remains largely positive. The hope is that continued vaccine progress and ongoing economic stimulus measures from governments around the world will help to shore up markets and lead to sustained growth over the longer term. In summary, world stocks have reached a record high on the back of vaccine optimism and strong tech earnings. However, experts warn that potential market volatility, geopolitical tensions, and uncertain economic conditions pose a risk to investors."},{"instruction":"Watch the video and choose the correct option: What country is the chef originally from? a) Mexico b) Italy c) America d) France","output":"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to the video you are referring to.

The study found that workers who took regular breaks were more productive than those who worked nonstop for long periods. Experts recommend taking short breaks every hour.","output":"New research has shed light on a common issue in the workplace: productivity. A recent study suggests that taking breaks could be the solution to increasingly better productivity. According to this research, working non-stop for long periods of time may actually be hindering our productivity levels, while taking regularly scheduled breaks could be the key to more optimal performance. The study found that workers who took short, regular breaks were able to consistently perform at a higher level than their colleagues who worked for long, uninterrupted periods of time. The reasons behind this phenomenon are twofold: firstly, our brains are not designed to function at peak performance levels for extended periods of time, and secondly, taking breaks allows us to recharge and refocus our energy, ultimately improving our productivity when we return to our tasks. So how often should we be taking breaks? Experts recommend taking short breaks every hour. This can include standing up to stretch, taking a walk around the office, or simply stepping away from your desk for a moment. These short breaks provide your brain with the opportunity to rest and recharge, ultimately boosting your abilities when you return to your work. In conclusion, while it might seem counterintuitive to take breaks in order to increase productivity, the evidence suggests that it’s exactly what we should be doing. Regularly scheduled breaks may be the key to unlocking our full potential in the workplace, ultimately improving both our performance and productivity levels. So, next time you start to feel overwhelmed or burnt out, take a step back and remember the importance of taking a break!"},{"instruction":"Convert the following sentence to proper case: i enjoy hiking and camping in the mountains.","output":"I Enjoy Hiking and Camping in the Mountains."},{"instruction":"Which color do plants primarily absorb and use for photosynthesis?

It was a historic win for the party, which had campaigned for Scottish independence in the referendum the previous year. The SNP's success has revived the debate over Scottish independence and increased pressure for more devolution from the UK government. The SNP's sweeping victory dealt a major blow to other parties, particularly Labour, which historically had a strong base in Scotland. The SNP campaigned on a platform of anti-austerity, more powers for Scotland, and opposed further cuts to public services. The party's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has promised to use their electoral mandate to challenge austerity, while also pushing for greater autonomy for Scotland. Following their victory, the SNP has increased pressure on the UK government to grant further devolution powers to Scotland, including the ability to set taxes and control welfare spending. The Scottish government has argued that such powers are necessary to protect Scotland's interests and ensure its economic prosperity. While the SNP's success has raised the prospect of another independence referendum, Sturgeon has made it clear that she will only call for another vote if there is clear evidence that there is a sustained and significant shift in public opinion in favour of independence. Overall, the SNP's success has redefined the political landscape of Scotland and the UK, and it remains to be seen how the UK government will respond to the demands for greater devolution and autonomy."},{"instruction":"Goal: Remove wall decals from a painted wall.

Ideological rifts deepened into legislative schisms, and cooperation gave way to conflict. A series of economic crises, political scandals, and societal upheavals led to an unprecedented movement. Nineteen states, among them some of the nation’s most populous—Texas, California, and Florida—declared their secession from the Union. They formed a coalition known as the Autonomous States of America (ASA). Emboldened by popular support and a drive for self-governance that echoed the sentiments of their forebears, these states quickly established their own congressional body and a unifying charter. The response from the federal government was swift, sanctions and declarations of treason abounded, but negotiation found no foothold on the slippery slope of division. The ASA did not seek conflict, but they would not capitulate. The stalemate broke when the newly formed Western Army, composed of volunteers and defected military units, began a daring march toward the heart of the old Union—to the White House itself. Chapter One: The Westward March The morning sun pierced the horizon, streaking the vast Arizonan desert with hues of fiery orange and crimson. Colonel Elijah Booker, appointed commander of the Western Army, stared intently at the makeshift map spread across his field desk. Once loyal to the Union, Booker was a man of principle, and what he now saw as the government’s betrayal of those principles had set his soul ablaze with the need for action. Booker’s orders were clear. Take your men and march toward the East, force a confrontation or secure a negotiation. History would judge them, but Booker knew this was the only path for people who believed the old government no longer represented them. The troops under his command were a diverse lot, made up of disaffected soldiers, seasoned veterans of foreign wars, and passionate volunteers from secessionist states. Men and women who believed the time for dialogue had passed, and that their voices would now be heard through the march of boots and the resolve of armed conviction. Chapter Two: The Seat of Power Back in Washington D.C., President Sarah Jacobs received news of the Western Army’s advance with a mixture of dread and resolve. Patriotism had defined her life’s work, and she viewed the march as nothing short of insurrection. Surrounding her were advisors who pushed for different strategies—from negotiation to full military mobilization. She knew, however, that any decision she made would either lead to bloodshed or the disintegration of the country she vowed to uphold. Jacobs ordered the mobilization of government forces with a heavy heart. Barricades went up, checkpoints established, the capital braced for a siege never before seen in modern America. Divisions of the National Guard filed in, the remains of a once unified military force, poignantly lacking the might it once boasted. Chapter Three: Heartlands Divided The Western Army found support in the towns and cities they passed. Civilians offered food, shelter, and even recruits to their ranks. In these places, where the flags of the ASA flew proudly above layers of the Stars and Stripes, the marchers felt justified in their cause. Yet in other parts, they encountered stiff resistance: protests by Union loyalists, saboteurs, and harrowing skirmishes with advance government patrols. The nation’s heartlands became a checkerboard of allegiance and dissent, each square mile a microcosm of the larger ideological battle tearing the country asunder. Chapter Four: Lines in the Sand Outside the grandeur of a fractured Washington, the Western Army set camp. Colonel Booker, now promoted to the rank of General due to his leadership, met under a flag of truce with President Jacobs’ envoys. The talks were fraught, each side demanding concessions the other could not give. As the parleys continued, the soldiers of both armies eyed one another warily, preparing for the worst while leaders sought a peaceful resolution. Elsewhere, clandestine meetings were held in the hopes of reuniting separated families and bringing friends torn apart by the conflict back together. A web of resistance and collaboration undulated beneath the surface, hinting at a social fabric that could, perhaps, still mend through shared humanity instead of shared nationality. Chapter Five: The Eleventh Hour The siege of Washington began with an uneasy stillness. The government forces, under the President’s command, stood firm against General Booker’s repeated demands. The people of the capital, caught in the middle, either fled or hunkered down, casting anxious glances at the skyline for signs of bombardment. Then, at the eleventh hour, as the last light of diplomacy seemed to flicker and die, a revelation shook both sides. A rogue faction within the ASA’s leadership, unbeknownst to Booker, had engaged in covert talks with foreign powers, seeking not just autonomy but also alliances that threatened the balance of global power. This betrayal of the secessionist cause, this threat to national sovereignty, gave President Jacobs and General Booker the common ground they desperately needed. For the first time, they met in person, under intense secrecy and amid the backdrop of impending civil war. Chapter Six: The Unpredictable Path In a historic moment, Jacobs and Booker emerged from their meeting not as enemies but as unexpected allies, united against a more shadowy adversary. The rogue faction was expeditiously apprehended by a joint operation, and the news was broadcast across the nation. The shared threat temporarily bridged the divide. The Western Army, with now hesitant support from government forces, defended the capital against possible foreign intervention. Booker and Jacobs together crafted a preliminary agreement that promised deep structural reforms—a tentative first step toward reimagining a new Union that could, in time, include the secessionist states without erasing their autonomy. Epilogue: Reunited We Forge Ahead Peace was fragile, and the road forward tortuous. The war was averted, but the scars of division ran deep. A nation reborn from the brink of collapse faced an unpredictable future. Yet in this new beginning, there was a glimmer of hope that, from discord, a more perfect union, one that truly represented its diverse and resilient people, could emerge. The novel of Divided We Stand closes on a nation not fully healed but willing to face its uncertain destiny, not as separate states warring for dominance, but as a coalition of people striving for understanding, justice, and lasting harmony. 이를 번역","output":"번역: 머지않은 미래에, 미국은 그 존재의 기반을 재편성할 현격한 골을 마주했다. 이념적 갈등은 입법적 분열로 깊어졌고, 협력은 충돌로 길을 내주었다. 경제 위기, 정치 스캔들, 사회적 동요의 연속은 전례 없는 움직임으로 이어졌다. 텍사스, 캘리포니아, 플로리다를 포함한 19개 주가 연방에서의 탈퇴를 선언했다. 그들은 자치주 미국(ASA)이라는 연합을 형성했다. 조상들의 정신을 되새기며 자치를 위한 대중적 지지와 추진력에 고무된 이 주들은 곧 자신들의 의회 기관과 통합 헌장을 구성했다. 연방 정부의 반응은 신속했으나 제재와 반역 선언들이 난무했고, 협상은 분열의 미끄러운 경사에서 발을 못붙였다.

Ensure that the \`STRAPI_CACHE_TYPE\` environment variable is being read correctly and is set to \`'redis'\`. 2. **Environment Variables**: Make sure the environment variables are being loaded properly. If you are using a \`.env\` file, ensure it's located at the root of the project, and all variables are correctly defined without typos. 3. **Plugin Versions**: Verify that the plugin versions are compatible with the version of Strapi you are using. 4. **Plugin Initialization**: Ensure that the \`rest-cache\` plugin is properly initialized in your \`plugins.ts\`. Strapi will load plugins based on your configuration, and if there's a mistake, it might default to using the in-memory store. 5. **Redis Connection**: Test the Redis connection outside of Strapi to ensure that it's running and that your app can connect to it using the provided credentials and configuration. 6. **Application Restart**: After making any changes to the configuration or environment variables, make sure to restart your Strapi application. 7. **Logs and Error Messages**: Look for any specific error messages in the logs related to the caching plugin at startup or during operation. There might be an indication of a connection error or misconfiguration. 8. **Correct Package Installation**: Check that the necessary Redis cache provider package \`strapi-provider-rest-cache-redis\` is installed correctly and that the version of the package is compatible with your Strapi version. 9. **Dependency Cache**: If you rely on external package managers or have a CI process, ensure that the dependency cache is cleared and all dependencies are updated to their latest compatible versions. 10. **Provider Registration**: It's possible the Redis provider isn't being registered correctly due to an issue in the plugin code or a version mismatch. Check the \`node_modules\` to make sure the Redis provider code is there and correct. If you've verified all of the above and the issue still persists, you may need to perform further debugging or check with the plugin's documentation or the Strapi community for known issues or updates that may resolve the problem. Remember, sometimes the simplest solutions can also fix the issue—for example, restarting your development environment, as environment variables are often read at startup."},{"instruction":"export default ({ env }) => ({ redis: { config: { connections: { default: { connection: { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6379, db: 0, }, settings: { debug: false, }, }, }, }, }, rest-cache: { config: { provider: { name: \\"redis\\", options: { max: 32767, connection: \\"default\\", }, }, strategy: { enableEtagSupport: true, logs: true, clearRelatedCache: true, maxAge: 3600000, contentTypes: [ // list of Content-Types UID to cache \\"api::category.category\\", \\"api::article.article\\", \\"api::global.global\\", \\"api::homepage.homepage\\", { contentType: \\"api::category.category\\", maxAge: 3600000, hitpass: false, keys: { useQueryParams: false, useHeaders: [\\"accept-encoding\\"], }, method: \\"GET\\", } ], }, }, }, } ). 这个写法 有有问题。问题在哪里","output":"您的代码中有一些小错误需要修正，可能导致配置不正确或者不能正常工作： 1. **属性名语法错误**: 在您的对象字面量中，所有的属性名都应该是字符串。像 \`rest-cache\` 这样带有横线的属性名应该用引号括起来以避免语法错误。 2. **配置结构**: 根据您给出的代码和通常的 Strapi 插件配置方法，\`redis\` 配置部分看起来像是独立的，而不是 \`rest-cache\` 插件的一部分。如果它是打算用于配置 \`rest-cache\` 插件，那么它应该被移动到 \`rest-cache\` 配置的 provider 选项中。 让我们修正这些问题: \`\`\`javascript export default ({ env }) => ({ // ... 其他插件配置 ... // 使用引号将 rest-cache 包起来，以避免语法错误 'rest-cache': { config: { provider: { name: \\"redis\\", options: { max: 32767, // 确保 connection 引用了正确的配置 connection: { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6379, db: 0, // 下面这两行在配置内是多余的，因为和缓存无关， // 但是如果是你需要的其它相关配置则可以保留 // host: env('CACHE_REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1'), // port: env.int('CACHE_REDIS_PORT', 6379), // 可以使用 env 来获取动态变量配置，或者直接写死 // 确保你的环境变量正确配置且应用已经重启使之生效 }, }, }, strategy: { enableEtagSupport: true, logs: true, clearRelatedCache: true, maxAge: 3600000, contentTypes: [ // list of Content-Types UID to cache \\"api::category.category\\", \\"api::article.article\\", \\"api::global.global\\", \\"api::homepage.homepage\\", { contentType: \\"api::category.category\\", maxAge: 3600000, hitpass: false, keys: { useQueryParams: false, useHeaders: [\\"accept-encoding\\"], }, method: \\"GET\\", } ], }, }, }, }); \`\`\` 在调整配置之后，确保重启 Strapi 服务器使得变更生效。如果问题依然存在，您可以查看 Strapi 日志获得可能的错误提示或者检查具体插件的文档和 Strapi 社区的相关讨论以获取更多帮助。"},{"instruction":"'use strict'; const config = { default: () => ({ provider: { name: 'memory', getTimeout: 500, options: {}, }, strategy: { debug: false, enableEtag: false, enableXCacheHeaders: false, enableAdminCTBMiddleware: true, resetOnStartup: false, clearRelatedCache: true, keysPrefix: '', keys: { useHeaders: [], useQueryParams: true, }, hitpass: (ctx) => Boolean( ctx.request.headers.authorization || ctx.request.headers.cookie ), maxAge: 3600000, contentTypes: [], }, }), validator() {}, }; module.exports = { config, }; 我在 plugin.ts 配置了。 rest-cache。它还是会调用读取这个node_modules/strapi-plugin-rest-cache/server/config/index.js 里面的配置 覆盖了我的配置文件。是什么问题","output":"在 Strapi 中，插件的默认配置通常位于插件的 \`node_modules\` 目录下，该目录含有默认设置，用于在您没有在应用层面提供相应配置时提供备选设置。通常，自定义配置需要在您的项目的 \`config\` 目录下进行，而不是在源代码中直接更改。 如果您在 \`config/plugins.ts\` 或 \`config/plugins.js\` 文件中正确配置了 \`rest-cache\` 插件，那么应用应当优先使用这个自定义配置而非插件自带的默认配置。 根据您所描述的情况，有几个可能的原因可以解释为什么 \`rest-cache\` 插件使用的是其默认配置： 1. **配置文件命名或位置**: 确保您的自定义配置位于项目的正确位置。对于 Strapi v4，应该在 \`config/plugins.js\` 或 \`config/plugins.ts\`（如果使用 TypeScript）中进行配置。 2. **重新启动应用程序**: 在修改了插件配置之后，需要重新启动您的 Strapi 应用程序。直到重新启动，配置的更改才会生效。 3. **配置格式**: 确保 \`config/plugins.js\` 文件中的格式正确，所有的配置应当对应其插件名称并导出为一个对象。例如： \`\`\`javascript module.exports = ({ env }) => ({ // ...其他插件配置 // 这里配置 rest-cache 插件 'rest-cache': { // Strapi v4 使用 'config' 而不是 'default' 作为配置的键名 config: { provider: { name: \\"redis\\", // 用您自己的提供程序代替 'memory' // ...其他提供程序选项 }, strategy: { // ...策略选项 }, }, }, }); \`\`\` 4. **加载环境变量**: 如果您的配置依赖于环境变量，请确保这些变量已经被正确地设置并被应用程序加载。 5. **配置覆盖**: 如果插件的配置在其它地方（例如 \`config/environment\` 下的特定环境配置文件）被覆盖，需要检查并确认不会出现冲突。 如果在检查了以上所有事项后问题仍然存在，您可能需要更深入地调查 Strapi 应用的启动日志，以确定为什么自定义配置没有正常加载。这通常涉及读取代码中的日志语句，以便理解配置加载过程中发生了什么。 另外，请保证您正在着手的是自定义配置文件所在的正确路径和文件，并确认插件的名称是匹配的。在 Strapi v4 中，插件配置文件通常位于项目根目录下的 \`config\` 文件夹内，并符合 \`config/plugins.js\` 或 \`config/plugins.ts\`（对于 TypeScript 项目）的命名约定。"},{"instruction":"senaryoya göre senin En İyi̇ Bebek Ürünleri̇ şirketlerini sıraladıgın bir web siten var.

Те самые длинные и самые весёлые каникулы в году, которые мы, дети 90-х и ранних 00-х, ждали с нетерпением.<br/><br/>Закончив украшать ёлку самодельными игрушками и мишурой, мы знали, что впереди целых две недели беззаботного счастья. Каникулы в нашем детстве были насыщены событиями: походы на горки в компании друзей, где мы мерялись длиной и скоростью спусков; бабочки в животе от полётов на санках и небольшие страхи перед самыми крутыми “горками”. <br/><br/>Неотъемлемой частью были игры в снежки, строительство снежных крепостей и создание всевозможных снежных скульптур от простого снеговика с морковным носом до целых фортов. Каждое утро начиналось с нетерпеливого взгляда в окно, в надежде, что ночью выпал свежий снег.<br/><br/>Каникулы были и временем творчества: мы рисовали зимние пейзажи, вырезали снежинки из бумаги, складывали кораблики и самолётики. Была своя особенная эстетика в мерцающих гирляндах, поделках из солёного теста и сверкающих на ёлке шарах, рядом с которыми неизменно стояли мандарины, аромат которых до сих пор напоминает о тех детских новогодних каникулах.<br/><br/>Мы с нетерпением ждали новогоднего утренника и встречу с Дедом Морозом и Снегурочкой, где каждый из нас получал свой момент славы, выходя на сцену для стихотворения или танца. А после праздника возвращались домой с небольшими подарками, которые казались нам чудом.<br/><br/>Новогодние каникулы в нашем детстве – это запах елки, ожившие сказки, шёпот хрустальных сосулек на крышах и блеск сверкающих звёзд в зимней ночи. То время, когда магия казалась совершенно реальной, а каждый день преподносил маленькие чудеса.<br/><br/>Такие воспоминания – настоящий кладезь ностальгии, наполненный счастливыми моментами, о которых с такой теплотой вспоминают взрослые, заглядывая сквозь призму прошлых лет.

Пользователь: Анализ главы \\"Тамань\\" Из романа герой нашего времени лермонтова Ты: Глава “Тамань” из романа Михаила Юрьевича Лермонтова “Герой нашего времени” – одна из пяти воспоминательных повестей, рассказывающая об одном из эпизодов жизни главного героя Печорина. Это повествование отличается от остальных глав своим мистическим и призрачным настроением и демонстрирует сложность и двуличность характера Печорина.<br/><br/>В “Тамани” Печорин описывает своё короткое пребывание в маленьком морском поселке Тамань, где он по пути в Грузию намеревался переправиться через море. Несмотря на кажущуюся прозаичность цели его поездки, Печорин сталкивается с рядом странных событий и фигур, которые придают этой главе атмосферу готического романа.<br/><br/>Так, здесь встречаются три загадочных персонажа: слепой мальчик, который читает сны и играет на гармони; девушка-контрабандист, испытывающая к Печорину двойственные чувства; загадочный рыбак, которого Печорин заподозрил в контрабанде. Ощущение таинственности усиливается ещё и тем, что все герои появляются в неожиданных ситуациях и обладают некоторыми странными чертами.<br/><br/>“Тамань” — это также рассказ о человеческом обмане и самообмане. Печорин, несмотря на свою проницательность и аналитический ум, оказывается в ловушке собственного заблуждения, веря в реальность увиденного “двойника” на море, который оказывается простым призрачным отражением лунного света.<br/><br/>Глава выделяется в романе также своим поэтическим языком и мрачным ландшафтом, становясь в некотором смысле отражением внутреннего мира Печорина, полного противоречий, тайн и не реализованных эмоций. Море, скалы, непогода создают фон, атмосферу подавленности и одиночества, который идеально подходит к размышлениям героя о себе и своём месте в мире.<br/><br/>Анализируя “Тамань”, стоит также упомянуть об основной теме всего романа — поиске Печорином смысла жизни и истины, его непримиримой натуре и бессильности перед обыденностью, которую он пытается разрушить, вступая в конфликт со всем вокруг и в первую очередь с самим собой.

Пользователь: Поход в цирк в нашем детстве напиши пост Ты: Поход в цирк в детстве… это было что-то особенное, нечто большее, чем просто развлечение — это было путешествие в мир магии и чудес. Светлые воспоминания о цирке начинаются с момента, когда в руках оказывалась пестрая брошюра с анонсами предстоящих выступлений, и взрослые обещали скорый поход на удивительное представление.<br/><br/>В воздухе витал дух приключений и радости, когда мы, держась за руки родителей, ступали под ярко украшенный цирковой шатёр. Запах попкорна и сладкой ваты смешивался с ароматами лошадей и мощи слонов, образуя неповторимый коктейль ощущений, который запомнится на всю жизнь.<br/><br/>Свет огней над ареной привлекал взгляд, заставлял забыть обо всём на свете. А детский смех сливался с оживлёнными разговорами зрителей, которые с нетерпением ожидали начала представления. Клоуны с розовыми носами, акробаты, выполняющие невообразимые трюки на головокружительной высоте, и грациозные гимнасты создавали атмосферу, где реальность казалась чем-то недостижимым.<br/><br/>Каждый номер цирка напоминал небольшое чудо: дрессированные животные удивляли разум своим послушанием, а фокусники заставляли сомневаться в собственных глазах. А как же аплодисменты! Они гремели в ушах, создавая чувство причастности к чему-то великолепному.<br/><br/>Поход в цирк в нашем детстве был символом радости, восторга и неподдельного удивления. Эти моменты остаются навсегда в памяти, как напоминание о том, что мир полон тайн и магии, достаточно лишь взглянуть на него детскими глазами. Подаренные впечатления живут в сердце, вспыхивая тёплым светом в моменты ностальгии.

Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм “RUN ZOMBIE, RUN” показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT: I am glad to see your engagement with the script and concern for the effectiveness of the dialogue and overall narrative. I will provide feedback based on the first page, as requested: Page 1: - The opening line spoken by Ed, “Science today gives shape to tomorrow’s reality. Let’s push boundaries,” sets an ambitious and pioneering tone for his character and the movie’s thematic focus on scientific advancement. It effectively introduces Ed as a visionary and key driving force behind the plot. The brevity and clarity of this dialogue also make it easily digestible for the audience. - The dialogue between Ed and Maria post-work illustrates their deep personal and professional relationship. Maria’s toast, “A toast to our love and the dawn of a new era in science,” while crisp and meaningful, could be diversified to avoid the potential cliché of ‘toasting’ scenes. Consider adding unique character traits or backstory elements to make the moment stand out. - Their kiss as “an ECHO in the void, a prelude to the TURMOIL ahead” effectively uses foreshadowing. However, the actual conversation before this moment doesn’t convey as much about their relationship as it could. Is there playful banter, supportive dialogue, or philosophical musings that can occur here to add depth to their connection? - Overall, the dialogue appears clear and advances the plot as intended for the first page, though it stays within traditional conventions. Considering the film’s genre and the challenge of establishing context quickly, this works adequately, but moments that reveal the characters’ unique voices or vulnerabilities might further engage the audience. Suggestions for improvement: - Infuse additional personal details into the dialogue to provide viewers with a more intimate understanding of the characters. - Avoid potentially overused tropes by enriching the interactions with subtle nuances, such as their shared history or individual quirks, which can add layers to the conversation. - Consider the pacing and flow of the dialogue, ensuring it feels natural and consistent with the characters’ established personalities. The introduction sets up the story effectively, but digging deeper into the characters’ personalities and dynamic early on can strengthen the viewers’ emotional investment in their journey. Certainly! Continuing with the feedback on Page 2 of your provided screenplay: Page 2: - The inner monologue from Ed, “The breakthrough we’re on… it’s unprecedented,” conveys his exhilaration about the scientific progress. It succinctly captures his dedication. However, this dialog can be less explicit and more showing. Consider integrating Ed’s enthusiasm into interactions with his team members or the results they’re discussing, making it feel like a natural part of the scene rather than direct exposition. - Maria’s words, “It’s remarkable, Ed. You’re on the cusp of changing everything,” introduces the scale of their scientific endeavor but may benefit from deeper emotional layers. To elevate the intimacy and the gravity of their work, you could include personal stakes or how this breakthrough might uniquely affect their lives. - The intimate exchange as Ed administers the injection to the rat (“Once we crack this code, immortality won’t be myth; it will be SCIENCE”) showcases the characters’ shared vision. Yet, this is a moment where personal and ethical implications could also come to the forefront, perhaps through a nuanced question or a contemplative remark from Maria, thus adding complexity to the scene. - The page ends with applause and a toast, “To science! To endless possibilities. To us!” The triumphant tone is appropriate given the context of the scene; however, the dialogue risks falling into a trope. Each character’s individual reaction to this event could ground the scene more in personal experience and provide further insight into their personalities and motivations. Suggestions for improvement: - Provide subtext in the dialogue through which characters reveal their personalities, concerns, or unspoken tensions underlying the celebratory moment. - Balance Ed’s professional tone with personal elements that hint at the weight of their discovery beyond the lab’s walls. - Rather than having characters reiterate the significance of their work outright, allow the environment (reaction of the team, the energy in the room, visual cues) to communicate the success and implications. Your Page 2 establishes the excitement around the scientific breakthrough effectively. Still, the addition of character-driven nuances and heightened stakes through dialogue would enrich the storytelling and enhance audience connection with Ed and Maria’s journey. Analyzing the dialogue and narrative style for Page 3 of your screenplay: Page 3: - The dialogue during the Genesis Conference Hall presentation effectively establishes Ed as a confident and visionary leader in his field. His proclamation, “Today, we stand at the cusp of a revolution—a breakthrough that could render aging obsolete,” carries the weight of potential societal transformation. While the dialogue shows his confidence, it may also benefit from highlighting potential conflicts or challenges they’ve overcome to reach this point, making the scene not just a moment of triumph but also one of reflection. - Maria’s exchange with her colleague (“This is more than an experiment—it’s a peek into a future graced with the gift of unending youth.”), while succinct and thematic, would have more impact if it also suggested an understanding of the broader implications of their research. It’s an opportunity to explore her personal take on what they are doing, which can give the audience a richer sense of her character. - An audience member’s interjection concerning ethics is a compelling element that injects a sense of reality and consequences into the celebration (“Dr. Kaynes, what ethical considerations have been addressed here?”). However, the response given by Ed might seem too concise for such a complex issue. Exploring this dialogue further could open the narrative up to deeper philosophical questions and tension. - The dialogue at the end of the page, where Ed and Maria share a silent acknowledgment, is a strong visual that consolidates their partnership. Yet, their public response to the ethical question can also provide a moment of contrast against their personal views. It can be an opportunity to introduce hints of doubt or concern that they might harbor privately. Suggestions for improvement: - Offer a glimpse into the ethical debates surrounding their work beyond the enthusiastic acceptance, providing a more nuanced view of the characters’ world and the potential consequences of their breakthrough. - Explore Maria’s perspective and her balance between sharing Ed’s vision and acknowledging the gravity of their discovery – perhaps with a more conflicted or contemplative line. - Allow the applause to be interrupted by a handful of dissenting or concerned voices, illustrating that not everyone is ready to accept their “revolution” without question – this can hint at conflict that will develop later in the script. Page 3 succeeds in painting a picture of professional acclaim but consider fleshing out the characters’ inner worlds and the societal ripple effect of their work to deepen the narrative and set up future conflicts. Continuing with the analysis precisely for Page 4 of your screenplay: Page 4: - The intimacy in the dialogues between Ed and Maria (“To us, beyond the science and the spotlight.”) in their private living room scene is effectively contrasted with the public atmosphere of the previous page. It’s reflective and personal, reinforcing their bond. However, you could add more texture to this conversation by weaving in subtle references to their shared past or details that allude to their individual apprehensions or hopes. - When Maria asks for a toast “beyond science and the spotlight,” it grounds their relationship in something deeper than their professional achievements. Consider deepening this by adding an aspect of their life which is distinct from, and possibly compromised by, their professional ambitions. - Ed’s reply, capturing the “miracle” of their love, is a touching sentiment but risks veering into cliché. You might consider how each character uniquely expresses affection based on their personalities to keep the dialogue fresh and poignant. - Their dance and the detailed description of the moment (“Laughter mingles with music—a rare cadence of careless joy”) provide a pleasant sensory experience for the audience. However, punctuating this scene with more subtext or internal conflict can amplify the significance of these carefree moments against their otherwise high-stakes life. Suggestions for improvement: - Expand the dialogue to include more distinctive phrases or references that are unique to Maria and Ed’s relationship, making their interaction stand out as genuinely their own. - Introduce a brief moment of foreshadowing or concern here — a gaze out the window, a lingering touch, a shadow passing by — that subtly disrupts their joy and hints at the turmoil ahead. - Have Ed or Maria articulate a personal dream or fear that has nothing to do with their work, giving more dimension to their characters and foreshadowing the potential costs of their scientific ambitions. On Page 4, you skillfully shift from a public to a private domain, emphasizing the multifaceted lives of your characters. While the tenderness between Ed and Maria is clear, deepening their dialogue to reveal more nuanced emotions and internal conflicts can add complexity, setting up for the challenges they will face later in the narrative. Analyzing specifically Page 5 of your screenplay: Page 5: - The page opens with a gripping alarm scene, introducing a sudden shift in tone from the previous intimate atmosphere to a sense of impending danger. Ed’s dialogue, “Alert the team… It’s the rat… It’s RESURRECTED,” is direct and clear, effectively ramping up tension. This abrupt shift is engaging but also risks feeling a bit jarring if not adequately foreshadowed in previous scenes. - The shock and horror are aptly conveyed through the dramatic turn of events and Ed’s reaction. However, the emotional impact on Ed could be explored further. This could be achieved by adding a beat where he processes what he’s seeing on the monitors before jumping into action, thus allowing the gravity of the situation to sink in for both Ed and the audience. - The use of technical language (“Alert the team… It’s the rat… It’s RESURRECTED.”) works to establish his scientific background, but it’s also a moment where you could introduce some more character-specific language or mannerisms that reflect how Ed uniquely handles crises. - The phrase “twitches, resurrecting into a GHASTLY VERMIN” packs a visceral punch and vividly portrays the threat. However, the physicality of the rat’s transformation might be expanded upon to heighten the horror, potentially through Ed’s description or reaction. Suggestions for improvement: - Use this moment to delve deeper into Ed’s psyche; brief fragments of internal monologue could capture his initial disbelief and slowly dawning realization of the consequences. - Given the shock value of the situation, consider showing a moment of vulnerability or hesitation in Ed’s actions — does he immediately spring into problem-solving mode, or is there a moment of paralysis as the horrific implications of the experiment gone wrong hit him? - To enhance the realism, the dialogue could reflect a more natural response to crisis, potentially with fragmented sentences or interruptions as Ed attempts to communicate under duress. This page serves as a critical turning point, transitioning from the introduction of the characters’ personal and professional lives to the unleashing of the central conflict. It’s effective at initiating the core plot’s momentum; by infusing additional character-specific reactions and providing a more nuanced depiction of Ed’s response, the gravity of the situation can be amplified, and the narrative tension can be further escalated. I appreciate your engagement with the script and your focus on improving dialogue quality. Here’s the feedback for Page 6 of your script: Page 6: - Ed’s motivating dialogue to his team, “Prepare the PROTOTYPE! We’re making history with every test!”, successfully conveys his leadership and the high stakes of their work. Nonetheless, this line could sound generic, and infusing it with more of Ed’s unique voice or established character traits could enhance authenticity. - The transition to the view of Science City through the montage is a solid narrative device that broadens the scope and showcases the city’s innovative spirit. Still, there might be an opportunity to juxtapose the energy of the city with a subtle indication of underlying tensions or foreboding elements that hint at the upcoming chaos. - The team’s response to Ed (“Prepare for revelation, everyone. Our vision, our reality!”) displays their dedication and enthusiasm but drops a chance to introduce individual characters’ perspectives or concerns within the lab, which could add depth and potential side stories. - The palpable anticipation leading up to the presentation (“Ladies and gentlemen, to the dawn of a new world unbowed by time!”) has cinematic grandeur but might benefit from a balanced, grounded lead-up that also showcases the pressure and doubts characters like Ed might feel. Suggestions for improvement: - Personalize Ed’s pep talk with his distinctive style or incorporate him responding to a specific question from his team that illustrates the nuances of the prototype they’re developing. - Integrate foreshadowing elements subtly within the city montage—a glimpse of an issue that could stem from or relate to their research, for instance. - Diversify the lab team’s dialogue to include varying perspectives or hints at their individual stakes in the project’s success, as this could enhance the tension and offer a richer character palette. - In the lead-up to Ed’s final speech, consider showing him taking a reflective, possibly anxious moment, adding to his character’s depth and setting the stage for the gravitas of the official presentation. On Page 6, the script maintains its forward momentum, positioning Ed as the driving force of their scientific enterprise. Deepening the dialogue to showcase a more complex team dynamic and infusing the buildup to the presentation with personal conflict can offer a more nuanced portrayal of the story’s central figures and magnify the impending sense of disruption. Providing feedback on Page 7 of your screenplay: Page 7: - The environment of the “GENEsis LAB - R&D DEPARTMENT,” as captured through Ed’s directive (“Today, we make leaps, not steps. Let’s ensure our NAMES go down in HISTORY.”), effectively sets a scene of scientific rigor and ambition. However, the dialogue risks sounding melodramatic. Consider adding a layer of specificity or a moment that characterizes the lab work in a more nuanced way to truly emphasize the historic importance of this day for Ed and his team. - Maria’s responsive remark regarding the “CELL’S REGENERATION” hints at the magnitude of their research and acts as a narrative exposition. To enhance the depth of her character, it might be useful to see her grapple with the immediate scientific excitement versus the long-term implications of their work. - Moving to the “GENEsis LABORATORY - HALLWAY” and the buildup to Ed’s speech, the dialogue (\\"Prepare for revelation, everyone. Our vision, our reality!) serves to underscore the importance of the presentation. Yet, the opportunity to provide more personal stakes or reflections by individuals in Ed’s team is again missed, which could add a layer of complexity and tension to the scene. - In the “PRESENTATION ROOM,” Ed’s dialogue sets up anticipation (“With every second we unveil MYSTERIES once bound to THE REALM OF GODS!”). This grand statement provides a sense of the transformative potential of their work, but Ed’s claim would benefit from a contrasting view within the room to highlight the diversity of reactions such a bold statement might elicit. Suggestions for improvement: - Avoid hyperbole in Ed’s directives, instead injecting his dialogue with specifics about the research at hand or acknowledging the combined efforts and unique talents of his team members. - Explore Maria’s intellectual and ethical curiosity further; as Ed’s partner, she could express both pride and caution, reflecting the duality of their groundbreaking work’s potential outcomes. - Introduce micro-tensions or subtle interpersonal dynamics within the team that signal varying levels of commitment or concern about the announcement, to add depth to their shared goal. - Infuse the buildup to Ed’s speech with a blend of anticipation and anxiety. Perhaps an assistant or a technical glitch momentarily interrupts him—a detail that reveals Ed’s ability to manage unpredictability and foreshadows future complications. Page 7 continues to sell the grandeur of Ed and Maria’s achievements and the beam of hope they represent for human advancement. By focusing more closely on individual character moments, the impending sense of consequence their work may bring could be accentuated, providing a richer backdrop for the story’s climax. Absolutely, here is the feedback for Page 8 of your screenplay: Page 8: - The description of the “GENEsis LABORATORY - LOBBY” in preparation for a significant event with Maria greeting guests provides a setup that illustrates the LAB employing a public-facing role. Her dialogue, “Welcome all! A remarkable day awaits us,” sets an inviting, yet formal tone. This could be enhanced by adding a personal touch or nuance, reflecting Maria’s thoughts on the event’s potential repercussions or her anticipation for the day. - Dr. Kim’s compliment to Maria, “Maria, your work is awe-inspiring!” while positive, feels predictable. Developing their interaction with more unique dialogue or touching on their shared history or scientific opinions can add layers to both characters. - The alcove conversation (“This could change everything, for better or worse!”) is an excellent technique to introduce secondary characters’ perspectives, concerns, and the potential ethical dilemmas of the LAB’s work. The dialogue achieves this but may benefit from showing specifics that the featured figures are worried about, making their concerns more tangible and impactful to the story. - Maria’s subsequent dialogue with Dr. Kim feels a bit on-the-nose. The statement, “Indeed, a door to the future is opening,” sounds too abstract. It may be more effective to show them discussing the practical applications of their work or the societal changes they expect, grounding their conversation in concrete terms. Suggestions for improvement: - To increase the richness of dialogue, consider adding subtext that hints at the characters’ complex emotions or reservations regarding the momentous day. This would both deepen the characters and foreshadow the potential consequences of their work. - Explore more personalized greetings from Maria or comments from guests that indicate the LAB’s impact on different societal sectors, perhaps including subtle hints of dissent or unease among excitement. - Use the private alcove debate to delve into more nuanced discussions about the implications of the lab’s work, offering viewers insight into varied societal viewpoints and increasing tension. - Develop Maria’s dialogue to reflect her layered relationship with Dr. Kim and her own internal conflict about their work ahead of the day’s big reveal. It could cement Maria’s character as one with depth and personal stakes in the work beyond scientific achievement. Page 8 maintains the momentum of the narrative as it leads up to the pivotal reveal. The dialogue and interactions are functional but lack the complexity that could come from showcasing the characters’ more profound inner lives or the gravity of the day’s events. Heightening the emotional subtext and including more varied reactions would enhance the dialogue’s impact and create a more textured buildup to the subsequent dramatic events. I am ready to provide feedback on Page 9 of your screenplay. Here’s the analysis: Page 9: - The dramatic unveiling of the project, as detailed in Ed’s dialogue (“Ladies and gentlemen, today we stand on the brink of a new frontier in science.”), succeeds in giving off a sense of historic importance. However, his speech may benefit from the inclusion of a personal anecdote or a reference to the journey they’ve had, offering a glimpse into his own vulnerabilities or sacrifices made for the sake of their research. - The audience’s reaction, filled with applause and cheers, is an understandable response, yet it might be interesting to vary these reactions to reflect a range of emotions and to foreshadow any potential conflicts or oppositions to their grandiose claims. - Maria’s pride in the crowd and her non-verbal communication with Ed adds a neat, cinematic layer to the scene, seamlessly aligning the personal with the professional. It could be enhanced by deepening the understanding of Maria as an individual; perhaps she has mixed feelings or specific reasons for why their success means so much to her personally. - Ed’s bold claim about “rewriting the narrative of human life” is powerful and sets up the scope for what’s to come. Nevertheless, it could be juxtaposed with a brief, subtle counterpoint in the scene — maybe a character in the audience showing skepticism or concern — to introduce an undercurrent of opposition or ethical doubt in the narrative. Suggestions for improvement: - Provide Ed with a personal story or reflection that he can share during his presentation to make the science more relatable and palpable for the audience. This could humanize the implications of their work and ground his character. - Integrate a wider array of reactions among the audience to highlight the diverse ethical and social reactions their announcement could provoke, thereby creating a richer narrative texture and priming viewers for conflict. - Offer more insight into Maria’s internal world during the presentation. Perhaps she can have an aside or internal monologue that divulges her true feelings about their discovery and its wider societal impact. - Consider introducing a credible voice of dissent or skepticism among the supporters to add narrative tension and create a more realistic, multi-faceted response to the prospect of rewriting human life’s narrative. Page 9 of the screenplay effectively communicates the weight of Ed and Maria’s breakthrough and conveys their triumphant moment. To provide more depth and set the stage for the conflicts that will arise from their discovery, consider dialing up the personal stakes and introducing hints of the challenges that lie ahead. Of course, here’s the feedback focusing on Page 10 of your screenplay: Page 10: - Ed’s triumphant declaration about the rat named PHOENIX and the “Elixir of Life” efficiently captures the cinematic reveal of a central plot device. The boldness of the statement fits the moment, but taking the time to show a closer view of PHOENIX reacting to the elixir, with observers’ reactions interspersed, would bolster the scene’s dramatic impact. - The scenes with crowds responding en masse can detract from personal emotional engagement. While cheers and applause may be a realistic response, they limit the depth of individual character reactions. Introducing cutaways to key characters in the audience who react differently — whether with skepticism, concern, or personal interest — would enhance engagement and tease future plot complications. - Ed’s bold claim, “Today, we turn the page, facing tomorrow’s SUNRISE—timeless and untamed!” is suitably grand; however, without grounding it with personal stakes or presenting a visible reaction from the team, it runs the risk of feeling detached. A contrasting perspective from either Maria or another character could introduce a valuable narrative layer, suggesting the dawn of this new world is not without potential darkness. - The page culminates in their collective triumph, yet the dialogue risks falling into a triumphant cliché. It might benefit from the introduction of a narrative element that subtly undercuts the milestone, such as a behind-the-scenes problem, to seed conflict and foreshadow future challenges. Suggestions for improvement: - Break the monolithic crowd response into individual threads — key figures can offer whispered comments, raised eyebrows, or looks of consternation that speak volumes without uttering a word, thus diversifying the reception. - Incorporate more nuanced reactions or dialogues from Maria and the team members during the presentation to showcase a spectrum of perspectives and add depth to the shared experience. - Consider Ed’s own reflections on the presentation’s implications and the effect their breakthrough will have on his personal life. A moment of contemplation or doubt could provide an additional dimension to his character. - Offer a glimpse into potential ethical or logistical concerns that the “Elixir of Life” might raise. This might include a brief side conversation between characters or a visual cue that not everything is as perfect as it seems. Page 10 continues to build upon the central narrative event, solidifying Ed and Maria’s scientific triumph. By interspersing individual reactions and underlying doubts within the public spectacle, you can weave a richer tapestry that not only showcases the wonder of their achievement but also foreshadows the complex ramifications of their “Elixir of Life.” Analyzing Page 11 of your screenplay: Page 11: - Ed’s engagement with the audience regarding ethical considerations, “ETHICS in science is our compass—steering the ship of discovery in RESPONSIBLE waters,” is pivotal for establishing the moral compass of the characters. However, the dialogue may benefit from showcasing a more nuanced exploration of the concerns being raised, perhaps by allowing Ed to cite a specific example that reflects his and the lab’s commitment to ethical considerations. - The Reporter’s inquiry about accessibility (“What of inequality? How will the ELIXIR be ACCESSIBLE?”) is an excellent moment, prompting a discussion that delves into the societal implications of their discovery. While Maria’s response is articulate, it might be further enriched by showing a glimpse of the dynamics between the researchers and policymakers. This would highlight the complexity of applying such a profound scientific breakthrough to society. - A BIOETHICIST’s question about the potential cost to society introduces a critical voice that enriches the dialogue by painting a picture of the debate surrounding their work. Ed’s reassurance of careful advancement might carry more weight if paired with a previous instance illustrating their commitment to caution. - The applause from the crowd, signaling solidarity and support, could perhaps be somewhat subdued or mixed with whispers of dissent to continue layering the public’s range of reactions to the breakthrough. Suggestions for improvement: - Present a moment where Ed or Maria references a particular protocol or past decision that exemplifies their dedication to ethics, grounding their lofty dialogue in concrete examples. - Include not just assurances from Maria but also perhaps her acknowledgement of the difficult road ahead in ensuring fair access, reflecting her awareness of the challenging reality. - Allow for some audience members to exhibit visible reactions to the bioethicist’s concern—some nodding in agreement, others looking concerned or perhaps unconvinced—thus highlighting the variety of public opinions. - Ed’s confident proclamation of their approach to risk could tie back to personal experiences or previous setbacks, which might offer the audience a more intimate understanding of how both he and Maria view their responsibility to society. Page 11 does well in portraying Ed and Maria as mindful of the broader implications of their scientific work. However, deepening the dialogue to include specific references to past actions and showing the array of public responses can provide a more robust, multi-faceted narrative that underscores the complexities entwined with groundbreaking scientific discovery. Providing feedback tailored to Page 12 of your screenplay: Page 12: - The elegant reception juxtaposed with sophisticated conversations serves as an excellent backdrop for the unfolding drama. The interactions, particularly that of Chancellor West (“Remarkable, Ed! The city’s abuzz with excitement.”), convey the public support and recognition. However, the dialogue might seem formal and lacking in individual distinctiveness. A more personal exchange would add depth. Perhaps Chancellor West could share a brief, personal sentiment or a piece of wisdom that hints at the weight of their achievements. - The debate between Dr. Rosenberg and Ms. Sharpe in the private alcove introduces a thematic counterpoint to the public celebration. Their concerns (“The box is opened… can they now control what spills forth?”) are essential for sewing seeds of doubt. Building on this dynamic by incorporating a balanced dialogue that reflects specific fears could enhance the gravity of their words. - Maria and Ed’s interaction with the young investors has the right mix of excitement and groundedness. While celebratory, there is an opportunity here to capture a more complex texture by subtly portraying Ed and Maria’s apprehension, like a visual cue that implies their internal worries despite the veneer of confidence. - The scene captures the intellectual solidarity behind the couple with lines like “To a NEW AGE! An era defined by your vision!” While the dialogue successfully conveys the investors’ enthusiasm, it might benefit from displaying more nuanced investor interests or concerns, as this would provide a realistic portrayal of their response to such a game-changing innovation. Suggestions for improvement: - Include specific, character-driven responses from the Chancellor that offer a perspective on the implications of the breakthrough from the city’s leadership point of view. - Expand on the private conversation between Dr. Rosenberg and Ms. Sharpe. They could discuss actual incidents or data that ground their ethical and control-related concerns, rather than speaking in hypotheticals. - When investors toast to “a new age,” showing Ed or Maria having an aside conversation or an internal reflection might unveil their own concerns about what ‘the new age’ really entails for humanity. - Perhaps frame the triumphant moment with a subtle, dissonant undercurrent—something as simple as a spilled drink or a flickering light that doesn’t demand much attention but visually echoes the notion of imperfection and foreshadows future discord. On Page 12, you’ve depicted a multi-layered scene that ranges from public admiration to Intellectual contemplation. While the script continues to set a celebratory tone for Ed and Maria’s breakthrough, injecting moments of private reflection or conflict would enrich the scene’s emotional complexity. By providing more personalized and conflicting viewpoints, the celebrations can transition from a moment of unequivocal joy to a more thought-provoking scenario, leading to a more intriguing plot development as the story progresses. Here is the feedback specific to Page 13 of your screenplay: Page 13: - The scene in Maria’s office (“Today was extraordinary, Ed. But I feel unease…”) offers a moment for introspection and foreshadowing. Maria’s admission shows her sense of foreboding and adds emotional depth. Yet, the dialogue could dive deeper, perhaps conveying specific fears or doubts about their work’s ethical ramifications, to provide a fuller picture of her internal conflict. - Ed’s reassuring embrace and response (“Today, we stepped into the unknown, trusting in our work…”) acknowledge the risk inherent in their scientific endeavors. However, expanding on Ed’s emotional response could reinforce his character development, showing a side of Ed that grapples with the consequences rather than merely offsetting Maria’s concerns with optimism. - The visual of the couple looking out upon the city skyline is powerful. To enhance this, consider adding a dialogue or action that creates a personal connection to the city — perhaps it is the place they met, or they muse about how the city has changed. This personal attachment could serve to underscore the stakes of their actions for them as individuals, not just as scientists. - The final dialogue of Ed (“The future rests in our vigilance…”) solidifies their joint commitment to their work’s potential risks. While the message is clear, Ed’s dialogue might be further developed to express acknowledgment of the many uncontrollable variables that come with playing god — a daunting reality that would naturally weigh on their consciences. Suggestions for improvement: - Give more depth to Maria’s reflection by including an anecdote or memory that grounds her unease in personal experience, connecting her emotions to concrete events or possibilities. - Instead of Ed immediately providing comfort, allow him a moment to process Maria’s concerns, reflecting his own struggle with the dual nature of their promise and threat to humanity. - As they look out over the city, have them recall a more innocent time or make a parallel between their growth and the city’s evolution, which can draw a poignant contrast with the threat looming over it. - When Ed speaks of the future, incorporating a dialogue that acknowledges the fine line they’re treading and the precarious balance of their ambitions against the risks involved can add nuance to his outlook. The scene on Page 13 does well to contrast the public adulation with private vulnerability, offering a glimpse into Maria’s trepidations and Ed’s unwavering support. By expanding on their internal dialogues and emotions, revealing their shared history, and enhancing their connection to the larger narrative, the script can build greater empathy for Maria and Ed and set the groundwork for the ethical and emotional trials that lie ahead. Certainly! Here is the tailored feedback for Page 14 of your screenplay: Page 14: - The transitional moment to Ed and Maria’s home after their achievement (“The decisions we’ve made… they’ll define us, Ed.”) is emotionally insightful, providing a thematic bridge between their public success and private concerns. Yet, the dialogue as structured leans towards the expositional. It may benefit from more subtlety and show the nuances of their apprehension through actions — perhaps finger-tracing a photo from their past or a hesitant pause before turning off the last light in the lab. - The reference to the cosmos and their dance beneath the stars (“Together, we are an UNBREAKABLE force against the tempest’s FURY.”) captures their romantic unity well, but adding a layer that reflects on the contrast between their control over nature’s laws and their submission to the laws of the cosmos could add a poetic depth to the moment. - The language and descriptions are vivid (“…as they stand beneath the cosmos. The FLICKER of candles is a testament to their enduring bond.”); however, the script could provide a closer look into their personal dynamics. For instance, displaying a moment of gentle humor or shared secret that only they understand could further personalize their relationship. - The scene sets an intimate tone but also provides an opportunity to plant seeds of further conflict (“This tranquility… May it shield us from the GALE that awaits.”). Drawing a subtle connection to their inner fears about the upcoming challenges — maybe a troubling call they postpone answering — would serve to subtly ramp up the tension for the audience. Suggestions for improvement: - Introduce body language or actions that betray Maria’s or Ed’s inner turmoil without explicit dialogue. Perhaps they hold hands but with a grip that reveals underlying tension. - Consider giving Ed a line that inadvertently reveals his awareness that they cannot control everything — mirroring the unpredictable nature of the universe around them. - Utilize their serene environment for juxtaposition — a silent moment where both characters’ gazes might reveal concern or doubt, indicating that not all is as serene as it seems. - As they bask in the safety of the night away from the public eye, incorporate subtext into their dialogue suggesting that their outward confidence masks an understanding that their successes come with potential consequences they have yet to face. Page 14 emphasizes the loving bond of the two characters, focusing on their momentary peace amidst the implied brewing storm. By introducing subtle signs of conceivable foreboding and deepening the dialogue with intimate expressions unique to their relationship, the scene could amplify the emotional intensity and groundwork for the future developments woven throughout your narrative. Here’s the analysis tailored for Page 15 of your screenplay: Page 15: - The stillness of the car scene contrasted with the “silent murmur of the city” subtly sets up a reflective space for Ed and Maria to converse, isolated from the external world. Their banter, hinted at in lines like “Just another day at the office for the Kaynes duo,” can enhance the depth of their relationship by balancing professional achievements with their personal rapport. However, expanding this into an exchange that hints at the emotional cost of their work could foster even greater intimacy in their dynamic. - The tension in their shared promise (“No matter what tomorrow brings, we face it together, Ed. Side by side, come what may.”) effectively communicates the solidity of their relationship while foreshadowing the challenges ahead. Yet, this moment could be improved by juxtaposing the comfort of their embrace against a backdrop of subtle environmental unease, perhaps the flickering of a distant light or the rustling of wind — elements that insinuate disturbances in their safe haven. - Ed’s conviction (“As long as we have each other, Maria. We can face eternity.”) reaffirms their mutual dependency and strength, which is a recurring theme. To reinforce this message without redundancy, consider introducing a vulnerability in Ed — an unsteady breath or a lingering look at Maria that suggests even he is unnerved by the journey ahead, despite his confident words. - The dialogue hints at a broader emotional spectrum but remains within expected parameters of romantic reassurance. To add complexity, integrate indications of personal longing, unfulfilled dreams, or remnants of fear that tug at the fabric of their shared professional front. Suggestions for improvement: - Add layers to their in-car dialogue with subtextual cues that allude to personal sacrifices made or anxiety about the impact of their work on societal norms and personal lives. - Utilizing the car as a metaphorical vessel moving through the night, convey that while they’re together on this journey, outside forces — like the ones they have unleashed — are beyond anyone’s control. - Ed’s line about facing eternity together could link back to a previous instance of shared joy, a scientific dilemma, or a personal trial that they overcame, grounding their bond in shared experiences rather than just forward-looking pronouncements. - Introduce a subtle sense of foreboding into the scene — a sudden silence in their laughter, a fleeting sense of discomfort, or an unexpected reminder of the chaos they’ve left behind at the lab — to contrast with the notion of their safety and control. Page 15 captures a raw, emotional moment for Ed and Maria that reflects the steadfastness of their bond amid looming challenges. Deepening their exchange with personal revelations and incorporating understated signs of apprehension can enrich the narrative, providing a contrast between their profound connection and the unpredictability of the future they’re facing. Continuing with the focused feedback for Page 16 of your screenplay: Page 16: - Ed and Maria’s evening at home is depicted as a peaceful respite from their daylight achievements. The toast, “To the miracle of you, the REAL discovery of my life,” exemplifies Ed’s deep affection for Maria. However, this line could verge into familiar territory and might be made more effective with a unique twist that expresses Ed’s feelings in a way that’s characteristic of the personal language they share as a couple. - The description of their dance and intimate interaction is touching, yet without additional context, it risks echoing similar romantic scenes. Introducing a specific memory they share or an element that connects back to their scientific or moral journey would add originality and depth, anchoring their personal exchange in the unique fabric of their lives. - Maria’s reply, “As long as we STAND together, no MYSTERY too vast, no challenge too daunting,” affirms their partnership’s strength. To enhance its narrative power, consider adding a personal anecdote or introspective comment that acknowledges the paradoxes they’ve faced — underscoring her optimism with realistic underpinnings. - The scene’s close focuses on the ephemeral nature of their contentment. Reiterating their triumph (“They stand, the architects of a future written on their terms.”) does well to remind us of the larger narrative at play. Still, the inclusion of an interrupting element — such as an urgent phone call they choose to ignore — could subtextually question the stability and control they believe they possess. Suggestions for improvement: - Refine Ed’s expression of sentiment by tying it to a specific event or shared interest that accentuates the uniqueness of their relationship and personal journey. - During their revelry, leverage their environment or a nostalgic object within the scene to evoke a fond yet poignant memory, deepening the emotional resonance of their celebration. - Have Maria’s dialogue reflect a juxtaposition of her external confidence with an internal admission of the daunting nature of their achievements and the shadows these cast upon their future. - Introduce a subtle instance of discord during their tender moment that hints at the impending turbulence — a reminder that although they may be architects of the future, they are not fully in control of the foundation upon which they’re building. Page 16 effectively portrays a private moment of companionship and underscored triumph between Ed and Maria, serving as a poignant counterpoint to their public personas. By adding personalized elements and a hint of imminent conflict to their dialogue, the screenplay can create a more nuanced portrayal of their relationship and the consequences of their groundbreaking work. Certainly, here’s the analysis for Page 17 of your screenplay: Page 17: - The juxtaposition of the stormy exterior with the passionate encounter between Ed and Maria adds a dramatic and sensual layer to the story. The restoration of intimacy (“their LOVE overflows; a TANGIBLE ENERGY undulates through the AIR”) works well, but consider further enriching this scene by reflecting on the dichotomy between their control in professional life and surrender to nature’s unpredictability. - The depiction of their passionate display, while framed tastefully, could benefit from focusing on the emotional stakes of their relationship, as much as their physical connection (“MOONLIGHT streams through the WINDOW, casting ghostly RAYS…”). Perhaps interlacing their dialogues or thoughts about fears and aspirations amidst their intimacy could elevate the scene’s emotional quotient. - Their lovemaking represents a moment of unchecked human desire amidst their rigid scientific pursuits. To ensure this scene doesn’t feel cliché or out of place within the larger narrative, ground it with callbacks to their shared history or even worries about the future they are actively shaping. - The narrative twist — the rat stirring and its ominous resurrection as Ed and Maria are preoccupied — is compelling. Nonetheless, it would resonate more if the preceding passion was mirrored later with regret or a sense of omission due to their preoccupation, highlighting the theme of consequence. Suggestions for improvement: - Interweave thoughts or dialogue that reveal their underlying concerns during their lovemaking, constructing a contrast between their current bliss and the complexities of their reality. - As the story unfolds from passion to the rat’s sinister resurrection, parallel the ‘resurrection’ motif with dialogue or a symbolic element in the bedroom. Perhaps they knock over a picture or spill something unknowingly — a metaphor for unforeseen outcomes of their own making. - Include subtle nuances where Ed and Maria express unspoken desires or concerns for humanity amidst their love-making, to hint at the personal impacts of their ambitions. - After the passionate zenith, offer a moment where Ed and Maria, sated, fall into a reflective silence, pondering the fragile balance between their personal affections and the impending chaos that their work may unleash upon the world. In Page 17, you effectively contrast the tempestuous exterior with the storm raging within, expressing both Ed and Maria’s deep bond and the unforeseen forces they’ve inadvertently set into motion. Introducing forethought and personal reflection into their most vulnerable moments could serve to remind the audience of the broader narrative, further weaving the threads of their intimacy with the foreboding reality of their situation. Analyzing Page 18 of your screenplay with the same detailed approach: Page 18: - The sharp interruption of sleep by the phone call is a classic narrative device to signal an imminent crisis. Ed’s reluctant answer (“All right… all right.”) followed by an urgent message received is realistic and gripping. To intensify the moment, perhaps include a brief interaction where Maria senses something amiss before Ed confirms her fears, thereby enhancing the tension. - Maria’s immediate worry, followed by Ed’s assertive response to rush to the lab (“It’s gone wrong at the lab. We have to go. Now.”), illustrates their close partnership and shared responsibilities. Nonetheless, this could be further developed with a glimpse of their individual reactions to the situation. This would emphasize the gravity of the news without explicitly stating it and add emotional layers to the characters’ reactions. - The choppy transition from bed to lab (“blood drains from ED’s face as shockwaves ripple through his very being”) is evocative but leaves space for more nuanced storytelling. A visceral body reaction from Ed would simultaneously show his shock and allow the audience to better envision the stakes of what’s transpiring. - The scene ends with a SMASH CUT TO BLACK, which is a powerful directorial choice highlighting the abruptness of the situation. Consider splicing in a visual cue that underscores the breakneck pace of the unfolding emergency — a knocked over glass of water, a photograph knocked askew in their haste to leave — offering a visual metaphor for their disrupted lives. Suggestions for improvement: - Create a link between Ed’s grogginess and a sudden jerk into action to highlight his swift transition from personal to professional urgency, perhaps through Maria’s expression of concern or Ed’s abrupt movement. - Build Maria’s initial panic with prompts that reflect their shared consciousness of what might go wrong, even before Ed speaks. This could be done through a non-verleg dialogue showing her hurry to dress or pack essentials for a potential emergency situation. - Dive deeper into Ed’s physical reactions to the news with descriptive language that portrays not just shock, but also the dawning realization and the weight of their actions that is crashing upon him. - Add a visual cue of disarray in their home, symbolizing their world turning chaotic — a reflection of how the external chaos caused by their scientific breakthrough has started to penetrate their personal sanctuary. Page 18 is pivotal as it forces Ed and Maria to confront the consequences of their work head-on. By focusing on the characters’ individual responses to the crisis and including extra visual details, you have the potential to strengthen viewers’ emotional connection to your protagonists. This will set the stage for the characters to reckon with the reality of their choices and amplify the sense of urgency that propels them into the action that follows. Continuing with the targeted feedback for Page 19 of your screenplay: Page 19: - The scene in Ed’s laboratory is effectively chaotic, with the blaring security alarm presenting a clear sign of crisis escalation. However, the scene could benefit from more detailed reactions or a quick back-and-forth between Ed and the security guard, which would not only heighten urgency but also ground the action in reality. - Dr. Laura Stevens’ dialogue over the phone (“Ed, it’s chaos here. The test… it’s turned into an outbreak!”) efficiently conveys the severity of the outbreak. It might be enriched by adding personal concern for her colleague, which would underscore the relationship between characters and provide context for the panic. - The portrayal of the rat as a horrific symbol is a strong narrative choice. To further amplify the horror, consider including a description of the immediate impact of the rat’s behavior on other lab elements or personnel reactions as they discover the animal’s transformation, adding to the sense of dread. - The transition to Ed in the remote viewing room (“ED stands in his remote viewing room…”) is stark, which effectively places him in the position of an observer of his own nightmarish creation. To make this moment more powerful, perhaps have Ed reflect on the earlier cues of danger he overlooked, thereby connecting his character arc more directly to the unfolding mayhem. Suggestions for improvement: - Intensify the immediacy of the outbreak through descriptive language that not only details the actions being taken but also hints at Ed and the security team’s inner turmoil as they react. - Deepen the security guard’s sense of panic with layered dialogue that reveals his personal stakes in the safety of the lab — maybe he’s concerned for a colleague or a particular section of the lab. - As the rat’s resurrection unfolds, consider contrasting its grotesque reanimation with flashbacks or rapid thoughts of Ed’s previous observations, amplifying the regret and fear that it’s now unstoppable. - Integrate physical responses from Ed such as gripping the phone tighter, narrow misses as he hurries to control the situation, or a personal mantra to keep focused amidst chaos — humanizing him further and adding to the intensity of the crisis. Page 19 builds upon the tension and horror elements, escalating the stakes with the depiction of a critical and dangerous turning point. Enhancing character reactions and dialogue while balancing action and emotional resonance can convey the magnitude of the crisis, compelling the audience to feel the weight of what the characters are experiencing. Adding these personal touches and intensifying the urgency through Ed’s responses would enhance the emotional gravity of the situation and set the stage for the challenges ahead. Proceeding with the tailored feedback for Page 20 of your screenplay: Page 20: - The sequence of events from the characters’ hurried drive through the city at dawn to their arrival at the GENEsis LABORATORY develops a building sense of urgency and foreshadows the pivotal actions to follow. Ed and Maria’s determination is clear, but this could be heightened by small moments of doubt or fear that creep into their conversation or body language as they approach the lab — a tightening grip on the steering wheel, a quick exchange of worried glances. - The in-car dialogue as they prepare for what’s ahead (“We will contain this”) could use an extra beat to show both Ed’s and Maria’s character development. Instead of a straightforward affirmation, explore the possibility of them using their personal leitmotifs or shared experiences to reinforce their resolve, which can add emotional resonance to the scene. - The description of their race against time to the LABORATORY is visually engaging; however, adding environmental reactions to their urgency — like startled birds taking flight or a streetlight flickering out as they pass — could symbolically enhance the gravity of the situation. - The final lines of the page (“The sunlight struggles against the growing shadow of catastrophe enveloping the city”) is effectively metaphorical, aligning with the broader thematic tension. Fleshing out this metaphor, maybe by highlighting signs of normal life abruptly thwarted or by capturing the last remnants of calm before the full scale of the disaster is revealed, can underscore the impending calamity. Suggestions for improvement: - Introduce more personal, introspective dialogue during their car journey, allowing Ed and Maria to briefly reflect on the human cost of their choices, juxtaposing their professional resolve against their private apprehensions. - During the car ride, provide a moment of silence — a sudden pause in their conversation signifying a mutual realization of the enormity of the crisis — to let the weight of the situation settle on both them and the audience. - Expand the depiction of dawn as they drive, perhaps by drawing a parallel between the encroaching daylight and the growing darkness of the outbreak, deepening the irony of the setting. - Just before they step out at the LABORATORY, let there be a moment where Ed or Maria hesitates — a subtle nod to the fear of what they might find inside that stands in stark contrast to their outward bravery. Page 20 propels the narrative forward by transitioning Ed and Maria from the safety of their domestic sphere to the epicenter of the unfolding crisis. By incorporating more detailed environmental cues and personal emotional conflicts, the screenplay can provide a stronger sense of urgency as the characters move closer to the harsh realities awaiting them, intensifying the anticipation for what’s to come. Here is the focused feedback for Page 21 of your screenplay: Page 21: - The description of the GENESIS LABORATORY’s security situation (the security guard engaging the lockdown protocol) successfully communicates the immediacy of the threat, providing a solid image of the lab’s response to the crisis. To elevate the stakes even further, consider enhancing the guard’s dialogue with expressions of personal concern or including auditory cues, like the distant sound of chaos beyond the room. - DR. STEVENS’s line, “Communications are down. We’re blind to who’s left,” succinctly captures the tension of the moment and the heightened stakes for the characters. This dialogue could benefit from a follow-up expressing the implications of this breakdown, such as limiting their ability to warn others or hindering coordination with external emergency services. - The SHADOWS slinking through the streets marking the spread of the infection is a strong image. Here you could add more sensory details, such as a chilling breeze that Ed and Maria sense as they leave the car, which parallels the creeping fear and the invasive threat they face. - Ed’s solemn voice-over (“The Pandora’s box we opened…”) provides an insightful reflection on the situation. Yet, it could be paired effectively with a visual representation of the proverbial ‘Pandora’s box’ in the lab — a left-behind piece of equipment or an abandoned project — to visually underline the themes of unleashed catastrophe and lost control. - The transition from the laboratory’s internal lockdown to the streets’ deserted state paints a grim picture of the spreading disorder. Fleshing out these descriptions with more detailed accounts of the city’s descent into panic — such as visual or behavioral specifics of the infected — could further amplify the sense of dread. Suggestions for improvement: - Offer a glimpse into the security guard’s personal stakes within the situation through panicked mentions of needing to contact family or protect a particular co-worker, adding depth to the urgency. - DR. STEVENS’s dialogue could include a personal admission of fear for her own safety or for the unknown fate of her colleagues, increasing the emotional weight of her words. - Ed and Maria’s silent drive toward the lab could be intercut with more intimate, fearful exchanges between them, underlining their dread of what is to come and building emotional connection between them and the audience. - As they navigate the security hub, describe not only their actions but also the state of disarray in the lab around them, perhaps showing remnants of hastily evacuated workspaces or scattered personal items, which humanizes the crisis and the panic it induced. Page 21 does well in capturing the isolating and shocking nature of the crisis. However, enriching the dialogue with more direct emotive expressions and including sensory-driven descriptions could strengthen the characters’ internal experiences and highlight the devastating impact of the outbreak. This heightens the suspense as Ed and Maria move from their sanctuary and into action amidst the catastrophic event they inadvertently helped create. Delving into the feedback for Page 22 of your screenplay: Page 22: - The opening description of the city under a veil of darkness transitioning to morning sets a haunting tone, reinforcing the encroaching threat. The eerie scuffle in the alleyway, where the homeless man is attacked, is well portrayed. Nevertheless, this could be further enhanced by expanding on his experience — the chill of the air, the trash rustling nearby, the scent of impending rain — to deepen the reader’s immersion in the scene. - The urgency in the Genesis Laboratory’s response is palpable, with the guards activating protocols, but more personalized dialogue might emphasize the gravity of the situation. The guard’s alarm (“Code Red! The subject… it’s not dead, it’s—”) can become more evocative with a brief snapshot of the guard’s personal reaction to the rat’s sudden movement, like a shocked step backward or his hand quaking over the alarm button. - The NIGHT SHIFT SECURITY GUARD’s call to action (“Immediate RESPONSE needed…”) captures the emergency well. You might consider presenting the guard’s immediate decision-making or internal conflict — perhaps there’s a protocol to follow that he hesitates upon, showcasing the interplay between duty and panic. - The concluding image of the supposedly safe laboratory against the rising sun is illustrative, conveying the shift from order to chaos. To raise the impact of this scene, introduce foreshadowing elements: the early signs of disorder within the confines of the ‘beacon of light,’ such as security systems beginning to fail or scientists experiencing rising tension and fear. Suggestions for improvement: - Consider opening with a more in-depth description of the homeless man’s surroundings to build tension before the attack—details that would give readers a sense of false security that’s about to be shattered. - Provide a more visceral image or behavior of the attacking zombies to convey their menace and the infectious spread, ratcheting up the horror and urgency. - Infuse the dialogue with a moment or phrase that illustrates each character’s emotional state or exhibits their shock, such as the guard’s stutter or gasp, to increase the sense of immediacy. - Depict the morning light’s struggle as a metaphor for the oncoming struggle between order and chaos, potentially through the perspective of a lab scientist or an outside observer who remarks on the unsettling quiet of the morning. Page 22 effectively continues to set the tone of a city on the brink of disaster, with Ed and Maria as central figures poised to confront an unimaginable challenge. By focusing on the terror of the initial outbreak and the vulnerability of the lab’s defenses, you underline the themes of encroaching darkness and foreboding that escalate the narrative tension. Adding more sensory descriptions and character-specific responses can further personalize the sense of impending doom and heighten the emotional stakes for the audience. Reviewing Page 23 of your screenplay with the same level of detail: Page 23: - The depiction of chaos at the CITY HOSPITAL (“MEDICS and NURSES dash frantically”) effectively contrasts with ED and MARIA’s focused entrance into the GENEsis LABORATORY, highlighting the broader impact of the crisis versus the personal journey of our protagonists. To enhance this juxtaposition, try adding small conversational snippets between healthcare workers that reflect the overwhelmed nature of their response. - DR. MARTINEZ’s assertive command (“Isolate the critical ones — every second counts!”) provides a glimpse into the tension within the hospital. Building upon her call to action with an emotional inflection — perhaps an expression of desperation or weariness — could make her character more vivid. - The deserted park scene with the abandoned bike is poignant, yet to deepen its emotional gravity, consider layering in somber details of abandonment or interrupted life (a forgotten toy, an open lunchbox, a ringing phone in the distance). - The EMERGENCY BROADCAST CENTER scene conveys the panic of the situation; however, the NEWS ANCHOR’s tension might be further communicated through specific details, such as trembling hands or a cracked voice, as she attempts to maintain composure while informing the public. - When ED and MARIA navigate to the ‘antiviral vault,’ the straightforward statement (“The antiviral vault… our only CHANCE.”) makes their goal clear but could be elevated by internal dialogues that reveal their increasing realization of the heavy responsibility they carry to rectify the chaos. Suggestions for improvement: - Introduce layered dialogue among hospital staff that reflects personal stakes or reveals the rapidly deteriorating conditions, driving up the tension. - Imbue the hospital scene with more textured visual cues — monitors flashing critical data, a nurse pausing for a deep breath — to intensify the direness of the medical crisis. - Utilize atmospheric elements to evoke a melancholic response at the park — an echo of children’s laughter that has eerily absented or swings swaying in the silence. - Integrate subtle non-verbal cues from the emergency broadcast anchor that belie her professional facade, adding a raw human touch to the emergency announcement. - As Ed and Maria discuss the antiviral vault, underscore their dialogue with personal recollections or a shared mantra that conveys the magnitude of their forthcoming endeavor while highlighting their scientific dedication and moral imperative. In Page 23, your ability to contrast the public chaos with Ed and Maria’s private scientific mission is clear and well-drafted. By infusing complementary scenes with more detailed sensory information and the characters’ individual emotional reactions, the screenplay can offer a richer portrayal of the unfolding pandemic and increase the readers’ empathy for the protagonists and secondary characters alike, all of whom are struggling against the magnitude of the disaster. Providing feedback focused on Page 24 of your screenplay: Page 24: - The scene at the PUBLIC SQUARE during an emergency announcement is a significant moment that showcases the public impact of the crisis. The NEWS ANCHOR’s grave message adds to the sense of urgency. To elevate this scene, consider letting personal reactions from the crowd filter through the chaos — this could be a mother comforting her child or a man pausing to help someone fallen, encapsulating the fear and humanity present in the moment. - Inside the GENEsis LABORATORY, the contrast between scientists’ hasty destruction of research and the methodical preparation of ED and MARIA heightens tension. To intensify this moment, think about adding dialogue or internal monologues that reflect the scientists’ desperation not to let their work go to waste and their fear of it falling into the wrong hands. - The MILITARY CHECKPOINT scene with the detailed movements of soldiers and civilians adds dynamism to the sequence. To deepen the emotional impact, consider exploring the personal sacrifices of the soldiers tasked to hold the line and the emotional impact their duty has on them. - The MAYOR’S OFFICE scene with MAYOR THOMAS STONE sends a message of solidarity and command under pressure. While his authority is well conveyed, revealing his private concern or a reflective moment after making the announcement could provide a more rounded depiction of leadership during a crisis. - The scene on the GENESIS LABORATORY rooftop as MARIA awaits the helicopter could be more evocative if you included sensory descriptions of her near-heroic environment (the wind tugging at her clothes, the sound of the helicopter’s blades cutting through the air). This will resonate more with the audience if her personal determination is juxtaposed with her vulnerability at this crucial moment. Suggestions for improvement: - Give voice to individuals within the PUBLIC SQUARE crowd to offer brief insights into the collective panic and individual stories that make up the crisis, enriching the scene with diverse emotional textures. - Include snippets of conversation or actions reflecting the inner turmoil among the scientists in the lab, their dialogue cut short by the urgency of the situation or the struggle to choose which materials to save or destroy. - At the MILITARY CHECKPOINT, showcase brief exchanges between the soldiers that hint at the gravity of their orders and the uncertainty of what they are containing, creating a more personal connection for the audience. - Pair MAYOR THOMAS STONE’s public declaration with a small, personal gesture (like an old photo on his desk or a glance at a family portrait) to subtly indicate his personal stake in the city’s fate. - During MARIA’s wait for the helicopter, rather than focusing solely on her resolve, introduce physical symptoms of her anxiety (a clenched jaw, a nervous fidget) to provide glimpses into her internal battle between fear and resolve. Page 24 consistently hones in on the juxtaposition of public chaos against private emotional struggles. However, by enhancing the characters’ individual reactions and dialogues and adding sensory details, you can more powerfully evoke the looming threat and convey the emotional complexities of people caught in the maelstrom, creating a vivid tableau of the dawn of the outbreak. Following the specified format, here’s the analysis for Page 25 of your screenplay: Page 25: - The scene of the deserted city streets paints a compelling picture of the abandoned urban landscape. The details provide context for the scale of the outbreak. To strengthen the emotional engagement with this setting, consider sharing a bystander’s perspective—perhaps someone peering through a window, torn between joining the escaped crowd or staying hidden away. - Inside GENEsis LABORATORY, the description of the scientists destroying research helps build tension. However, it could benefit from a more intricate view of their conflicting emotions—perhaps they destroy the fruits of their life’s work with shaking hands, wrestling with the reality of what they’ve unleashed versus their passion for discovery. - The military checkpoint sequence, with soldiers setting up barricades, effectively reflects the societal response to the crisis. However, it could be enriched with brief interactions revealing personal glimpses into the lives of those affected—a brief dialogue that conveys their dread or determination. - The “beacon of hope” visual of the city hospital offers a stark counterpoint to the unfolding disaster. To add depth, consider incorporating an aspect of the hospital scene that illustrates the vulnerability of this last bastion—a whispered prayer from a medic or the quickened pace of an orderly. - The rooftop scene with Maria clutching the vial as a symbol of hope captures her courage amid the turmoil. This moment can be further magnified by letting physical elements reinforce her determination—a tightening grip on the railing as the helicopter approaches or a backward glance at the lab where so much of her life was spent. Suggestions for improvement: - Add a brief segment where we see the chaotic transition from normal life to abandonment on the city streets, underlining the speed and severity of the outbreak. - In the scientist destruction scene, include specific details about their reactions to hint at the morale within the lab—a muttered curse, a resigned sigh, or the final glance at their work. - At the military checkpoint, depict soldiers who are also parents, friends, or siblings, grounding their military actions in their personal lives and concerns for loved ones. - Within the city hospital tableau, interlace flashes of personal struggle or small acts of empathy amid the medical staff’s frantic efforts, bringing humanity into the crisis. - Highlight Maria’s vulnerability on the rooftop just before her escape, showing her fighting back tears or taking a steadying breath—a moment of human frailty before she steps into the role of savior. Page 25 of the screenplay does well to underscore the pervasive sense of desolation and danger as the outbreak spreads. By introducing more personalized touches to the description and by deepening the character reactions as they cope with the immediate needs of crisis management, the screenplay will engage the audience on a deeper level and heighten the emotional stakes of the narrative. Providing detailed feedback for Page 26 of your screenplay: Page 26: - Ed’s significant transformation detailed through physical description effectively portrays the horror of his metamorphosis. However, the emotional impact could be amplified by adding Maria’s visceral reaction to witnessing this change—perhaps her struggle between staying by Ed’s side versus the necessity to find their children. - The depiction of Ed’s staggering through the streets highlights the personal cost of the outbreak. To heighten the sense of empathy from the audience, consider showing him clutching a token of his family’s affection or having a flashback to happier times, which starkly contrasts with his current horrifying predicament. - Maria’s heart-wrenching cry (“I love you… I’ll FIND them, Ed. I PROMISE!”) carries emotional weight. Still, it would convey a greater sense of desperation if it were interspersed with Maria fumbling with a keepsake Ed has given her or looking at something that signifies their past happiness. - The end of the page, where Ed disappears into the horde, is a poignant moment. The narrative could resonate more deeply by briefly hinting at Ed’s internal struggle to maintain his humanity despite the zombification, perhaps through brief, coherent thoughts amidst the chaos of his transformation. Suggestions for improvement: - Introduce a direct internal monologue from Maria as she watches Ed’s transformation, revealing her mix of fear, love, and determination to continue their mission. - Provide Ed a moment of lucidity amid the zombies where he consciously takes a path away from Maria, showing his will to protect her even in his altered state. - Break Maria’s final vow with sobs or moments of breathlessness, adding to the authenticity of her emotional state and showing the rawness of her pain and resolve. - As Ed melds into the swarm of the undead, briefly narrate his stream of consciousness—a touch of Ed’s scientific mind trying to analyze his condition, interspersed with his longing to hold onto thoughts of his wife and children. Page 26 powerfully conveys the theme of sacrifice and the human cost of the escalating crisis. Enriching the scene with more deeply personal elements and internal character conflict can enhance the emotional gravitas and present a stark portrayal of the tragedy that Ed and Maria face as a result of their scientific breakthrough reverberating out of control. Continuing with the focused feedback for Page 27 of your screenplay: Page 27: - Ed and Maria’s dire situation in the security room conveys urgency well (“We face this. Find the antidote. We END this plague…”), but there is an opportunity to further heighten the tension through fragmented dialogue or through them exchanging meaningful, tension-filled looks that speak louder than words, showing both their dedication and underlying fear. - The rat’s ominous escape from the enclosure is a pivotal moment. Building in a slight delay in response from Ed as he processes the immediate threat, followed by a frantic scramble to counteract the escape, would underscore the high stakes and Ed’s personal investment in rectifying the crisis. - Maria’s pledge to find the antidote is a strong call to action. To deepen this moment, consider introducing a tactile element, such as Maria grasping Ed’s hand for strength or clasping a locket representing their family, to anchor her determination in something tangibly personal. - Their rush to the VAULT, underscored with the line “For our children… for survival, we must reach the cure,” communicates their overarching motivation. However, infusing this scene with sensory details (like the feel of cold storage units or the hiss of sealed doors) can create a more pronounced atmosphere around their mission. Suggestions for improvement: - Manifest Ed and Maria’s partnership in crisis through non-verbal expressions of unity and determination. Showcase a moment where one reassures the other with a single look, ensuring that it conveys both their unwavering bond and the gravity of their situation. - When the rat escapes, supplement Ed’s reaction to the escaped subject with visceral fear or even a moment of scientific curiosity battling his panic, delivering insight into how he reconciles his professional identity with the unfolding horror. - Elevate Maria’s dialogue of commitment — let the urgency of their mission be punctuated by a small, emotional quiver in her voice or a firm set to her jaw, which conveys her internal steel despite the terror. - During their pursuit of the antidote, interlace Ed’s and Maria’s movement with quick-paced, almost staccato-like dialogue that reflects their rush and the weight of the task they face. Page 27 captures the story’s pivot from fear to proactivity as Ed and Maria scramble to avert a worsening catastrophe. By refining character interactions to accentuate emotional stakes and enhancing descriptive details, the screenplay can bolster the tension, grounding the urgency of their quest in visceral terms and magnifying the narrative impetus as they press forward. As requested, here’s the tailored feedback for Page 28 of your screenplay: Page 28: - The intensity of the scene in the corridor as zombies shamble into view creates a powerful visual. However, the immediate threat could be heightened by adding detailed descriptions of the zombies’ appearance and the petrifying sound of their approach. - Ed’s protective action (“Ed… move!”) helps define his character’s bravery. To add depth, you could show a brief moment of internal conflict—he is determined to save Maria but agonized by the prospect of leaving his team behind or the lab where he spent years working. - The emotional impact when Maria is forced to leave Ed behind (“Maria… you have to GO… Find the ANTIDOTE…”) is palpable, but can be further heightened by deeper insights into Maria’s thoughts, perhaps through a compelling internal monologue where she grapples with her choice to stay or flee. - Ed’s sacrifice in pushing Maria out the escape hatch is a defining moment. Following this with a lingering description of Maria’s physical and emotional struggle could make the sequence more evocative. Perhaps she claws at the hatch or looks back one last time in hope, underlining the excruciating nature of her decision. Suggestions for improvement: - Emphasize the buildup of terror in the corridor not just through the zombies’ movements but also by invoking other senses—smell, sound, anticipation—to create a more immersive experience for the audience. - During Ed’s call to action, drawing upon his emotions can add layers to this critical moment—his might enact a small gesture that signifies his struggle or a whispered apology to Maria, revealing his anguish amidst the resolve. - As Maria resists leaving Ed behind, show more of her perspective, with vivid imagery or fragmented dialogue that captures her pain and desperation, making her dread and resolution more acute. - After her escape, while Maria’s despair is significant, intersperse her sobs with flashbacks to key moments she shared with Ed, counterposing her mission’s weight against her personal loss, thus intensifying the emotional stakes. Page 28 dramatizes the chaos erupting from the lab’s broken barriers effectively and showcases the emotional turmoil Ed and Maria face as disaster strikes close to them. Deepening the personal conflict and enhancing sensory details can further amplify the horror and tragedy of the scene, evoking a stronger emotional response from the audience and providing a profound insight into the characters’ shared agony and resolve. Certainly, here is the analysis for Page 29 of your screenplay: Page 29: - The urgency within the SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY is palpable, as heightened by Maria’s desperate action to synthesize the antidote. To deepen this portrayal, you might add physical manifestations of Maria’s stress—perhaps her hands tremble as she works, showing her determination interwoven with fear. - Ed’s condition and his weak encouragement, illustrated in his strained dialogue, captures the growing desperation of their situation. Greater insight into Ed’s mind at this crucial moment could be revealed through something he murmurs or an expression he directs at Maria—indicating his fading coherence as the transformation progresses. - The chaotic intrusion of the undead adds a layer of horror to the scene. This could be more chilling if complemented by sound cues from within the lab—such as heavy breathing, or the faint buzzing of scientific equipment in the background, heightening the atmosphere of dread. - The emotional climax as Ed sacrifices himself for Maria is profound. However, the moment where Maria is forced out (“ED, I can’t… I WON’T leave you!”) lacks a sense of her internal struggle. Adding Maria’s visceral response—screams muffled by the sound of the helicopter, or her physically being pulled away—would vividly portray the tension between her instinct to stay with Ed and the necessity to escape. Suggestions for improvement: - Fill out Maria’s frantic activity with expressions of her inner monologue, reminiscent of challenges they’ve overcome in the lab before or doubts she harbors about the possibility of a cure. - Enhance Ed’s deteriorating state with subtle details that emphasize the physical changes he’s going through, grounding the transformation in tangible symptoms. - Layer the soundscape of the breach by the undead with heightened descriptions of the environment reacting to their presence, increasing the sense of imminent peril surrounding Maria and Ed. - As Maria is pushed to escape, illustrate her emotional breakdown with physical details, such as her clawing the walls or leaving behind a personal belonging that Ed gifted her, symbolizing her severed connection with Ed. Page 29 effectively conveys the scramble for the antidote and the pivotal self-sacrifice that Ed makes. Intensifying the personal despair and psychological depth of this moment can boost the emotional resonance of the scene, firmly establishing the stakes of Maria’s escape and the tragic nature of Ed’s selfless act. By doing so, the script can bolster the intensity and set the stage for the impending narrative climax. Continuing with the detailed feedback approach for Page 30 of your screenplay: Page 30: - The moment of truth arrives as Maria engages in the intense procedure to synthesize the cure in the lab. Her words, “For Ed, for our children… for EVERYONE,” carry the weight of her profound responsibility. This could be further emphasized with action—Maria’s hands might hesitate before they steady, reflecting the immense pressure she feels to succeed. - As Ed rampages through the city, his poignant struggle to maintain his humanity despite his zombification reveals the duality of his character. To add nuances to this portrayal, consider incorporating subtle involuntary reactions that betray his inner turmoil, like a pained expression when he hears a familiar sound or a momentary falter in his determined stride. - Maria’s anguished declaration, “This is the BEGINNING. Run Zombie, RUN!” serves as a rallying cry and a climax to her emotional arc. To strengthen this pivotal scene, introduce physical indicators of Maria’s metamorphosis from despair to determination—perhaps she instinctively touches something Ed gave her for comfort or clutches the vial tighter, drawing on newfound resolve. - The culmination of the page brings intense emotion into focus. However, adding sensory details like Maria sensing the chemical fumes of the lab or the coldness of the steel surfaces she works on would ground her experience in vivid imagery, connecting the audience more deeply to each moment. Suggestions for improvement: - During Maria’s work in the lab, interweave snippets of her recalling Ed’s words or actions related to their past breakthroughs, which now guide her trembling hands through the synthesis process. - Illustrate Ed’s inner conflict through his actions—one moment aggressive as the zombies around him, the next pausing as if catching a whiff of Maria’s perfume in the air or a child’s laugh that anchors him to his fading humanity. - When Maria speaks her last line on the page, contrast her steely determination with a momentary crack in her voice or a tear that she brushes away, symbolizing the strength that emerges from vulnerability. - As the script transitions from Maria’s intense concentration to Ed’s monstrous existence, use these final beats to mirror their former life against the current chaos, such as by showing Maria momentarily distracted by a memory evoked by an item in the lab—perhaps a picture of their family or a memento from a significant event in their careers. Page 30 brings Maria’s emotional journey to a heightened turning point as she prepares to combat the undead nightmare her research partly created. By further anchoring her actions in personal significance and highlighting Ed’s struggle with his monstrous fate, the screenplay can emphasize the profound personal loss and determination at the heart of the story. This intertwines their scientific venture with the deep human emotions at play, setting up a gripping narrative as the plot moves forward. ИСПРАВЬТЕ ПОЖАЛУЙСТА PAGES 2 OF 150 МОЕГО ГОТОВОГО СЦЕНАРИЯ ИСПОЛЬЗУЯ FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT, СДЕЛАЙТЕ ТАК, ЧТОБЫ ДЛИНА ТЕКСТОВ PAGES 2 OF 150 РАВНА ОДНОМУ ЛИСТУ LETTER 21,59 x 27,94 СМ,А ТАКЖЕ СДЕЛАЙТЕ ОЧЕНЬ МНОГО СЛОВ С ЗАГЛАВНЫМИ БУКВАМИ И В ДИАЛОГАХ : FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT: Certainly! Continuing with the feedback on Page 2 of your provided screenplay: Page 2: - The inner monologue from Ed, “The breakthrough we’re on… it’s unprecedented,” conveys his exhilaration about the scientific progress. It succinctly captures his dedication. However, this dialog can be less explicit and more showing. Consider integrating Ed’s enthusiasm into interactions with his team members or the results they’re discussing, making it feel like a natural part of the scene rather than direct exposition. - Maria’s words, “It’s remarkable, Ed. You’re on the cusp of changing everything,” introduces the scale of their scientific endeavor but may benefit from deeper emotional layers. To elevate the intimacy and the gravity of their work, you could include personal stakes or how this breakthrough might uniquely affect their lives. - The intimate exchange as Ed administers the injection to the rat (“Once we crack this code, immortality won’t be myth; it will be SCIENCE”) showcases the characters’ shared vision. Yet, this is a moment where personal and ethical implications could also come to the forefront, perhaps through a nuanced question or a contemplative remark from Maria, thus adding complexity to the scene. - The page ends with applause and a toast, “To science! To endless possibilities. To us!” The triumphant tone is appropriate given the context of the scene; however, the dialogue risks falling into a trope. Each character’s individual reaction to this event could ground the scene more in personal experience and provide further insight into their personalities and motivations. Suggestions for improvement: - Provide subtext in the dialogue through which characters reveal their personalities, concerns, or unspoken tensions underlying the celebratory moment. - Balance Ed’s professional tone with personal elements that hint at the weight of their discovery beyond the lab’s walls. - Rather than having characters reiterate the significance of their work outright, allow the environment (reaction of the team, the energy in the room, visual cues) to communicate the success and implications. Your Page 2 establishes the excitement around the scientific breakthrough effectively. Still, the addition of character-driven nuances and heightened stakes through dialogue would enrich the storytelling and enhance audience connection with Ed and Maria’s journey. МОЙ НЕЗАВЕРШЕННЫЙ СЦЕНАРИЙ ДЛЯ ФИЛЬМА “RUN ZOMBIE, RUN!”: PAGE 1 OF 150 (REDUCED): FADE IN: EXT. SCIENCE CITY – DAYLIGHTS The city breathes a perfect blend of NATURE and HUMAN INGENUITY. SOLAR PANELS are tactfully integrated onto traditional and modern BUILDINGS alike, while public parks and GREEN SPACES provide a REFUGE amid the urban sprawl. The streets are lively, filled with PEOPLE who are confident in their stride—a SYMBOL of a society where technology enhances life rather than overpowers it. The DIGITAL SIGNAGE is subtle yet informative, blending seamlessly into the cityscape. It highlights RECENT ADVANCES in biotechnology and renewable energy, proclaiming the community’s COMMITMENT to a sustainable, yet recognizable future. This SCIENCE CITY is a testament to BALANCED progress—an IDENTIFIABLE present with a PROMISE of tomorrow, evoking a SENSE of FAMILIARITY that will starkly contrast the DESOLATION to come once the ZOMBIE menace arises. PAN QUICKLY TO: INT. GENEsis LAB - CONTINUOUS Focus on EDWARD “ED” KAYNES (30s), a DEFIER of nature’s code, PRECISE and DRIVEN in his sanctuary of science. A quiet pioneer amid the facility’s SYMPHONY of innovation. ED (to his TEAM, an electric charge in his voice) Today, we sculpt tomorrow, shaping reality with the chisel of PROGRESS. To the edges of possibility — REACH! C MATCH CUT TO: EXT. HOPE CITY - NIGHTFALL The pulsing heart of the city gives way to the QUIET SYMPHONY of the twilight. ED and MARIA, A PARTNERSHIP of minds, close, embrace the dimming glow of their PIONEERING SCIENCE. They raise glasses on their balcony, insulated from the city’s hum — an OASIS of peace. The cool NIGHT AIR carries whispers of their audacious dreams. MARIA (her eyes twinkling with a shared joke) To LOVE—amidst our own revolution of science and beyond. Their lips MEET — a gesture that’s both a PLEDGE to each other and an acknowledgment of the CHALLENGES awaiting them. As the KISS deepens, the cityscape cast in half-shadow serves as a STARK FORESHADOWING, a vivid metaphor for the DICHOTOMY of their lives: PUBLIC TRIUMPHS shadowed by PRIVATE FEARS. CUT TO: FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 1 OF 150 PAGE 2 OF 150 (REDUCED): INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ED’S LAB - DAY The hustle of SCIENCE CITY fades into the hushed hum of the lab. ED KAYNES, mid-30s, a devoted scientist, scribbles fervently. SURROUNDED by beeping machines and his diligent TEAM busy at work. ED (to himself) The breakthrough we’re on… it’s unprecedented. MARIA, Ed’s better half and research powerhouse, observes a white rat through a glass enclosure, her face lit by the GLOW of progress. MARIA (looking up) It’s remarkable, Ed. You’re on the cusp of changing everything. Ed’s eyes never stray from the task at hand, his deep focus symptomatic of the lifelong quest that burns within him. ED (filled with anticipation) Once we crack this code, immortality won’t be myth; it will be SCIENCE. MARIA approaches with a tray of SYRINGES, each containing a glowing liquid. MARIA (holding up a syringe) This could be it, the key to life eternal. ED takes a syringe, veins coursing with adrenaline, as he administers the injection. ED’S TEAM lean in, their collective breath held. The rat stirs, its chest rising with potent vitality. TEAM MEMBER #1 (excited) It’s like witnessing the dawn of a new age, Ed! APPLAUSE breaks out. Ed and Maria share a moment of TRIUMPH — their dedication morphing into reality. ED (his voice rising above the applause) To science! To endless possibilities. To us! Maria squeezes his hand tightly. NIGHT FALLS, and they head home, unaware that their breakthrough grants not just life, but an unfathomable curse. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 2 OF 150","output":"Incorporating the feedback and suggestions provided, here is the revised Page 2 of your script \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN!\\" with dialogue and actions amended to offer deeper emotional layers, nuanced character interactions, and more showing rather than telling: --- PAGE 2 OF 150 (REVISED): INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - MAIN LAB - DAY In the pristine main lab, a symphony of scientific endeavor plays out. EDWARD \\"ED\\" KAYNES (30s) stands amidst his diligent team, eyes burning with the flames of discovery. ED (to his TEAM, with an assertive charm) Penetrate the veil of mortality! Today, history charts alongside our names. Team members huddle around him, absorbed by the gravity of their task. Transfixed on the METICULOUS WORK before them, machines WHIR and BEEP as if in harmonious concord. MARIA KAYNES, Ed’s devoted wife and co-scientist, a SPARK of genius in her own right, gently places a GLEAMING SYRINGE onto the tray. She shares a knowing, supportive glance with Ed. MARIA (to Ed, her voice hushed with awe) This... could rewrite the very code of life. As Ed tenderly picks up the syringe, his hands are STEADY, yet the SLIGHTEST QUIVER betrays the MAGNITUDE of the moment. CLOSE UP: The rat, once fragile with age, perks up. ASSISTANTS lean in, watching life BLOOM anew in the rejuvenated creature. TEAM MEMBER #1 (moving forward, her voice a mixture of reverence and wonder) Are we gods now, Ed? Or caretakers of Eden? Laugher and nervous glances ricochet around the lab, joy tinged with an undercurrent of trepidation. ED (raising his glass, pride mingles with a hint of defiance) To the march of progress! To humanity’s New Horizon! Their glasses CLINK—simple crystal brimming with the complexity of their ambition. The team rejoices, yet Ed’s eyes stray to the window, a SLIVER of doubt as night envelopes the city. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 2 OF 150 --- This revised page expanded on the characters' emotions, restructured the dialogue to infuse it with subtext reflective of their inner conflicts, and heightened the scenes with more descriptive actions to showcase each character’s personality and concerns. The use of CAPITALIZED keywords underscores the significance of specific elements, contributing to the overall drama and intensity. Please note that the presented rewrite fits a standard screenplay page, roughly estimated for a LETTER-size document, depending on final formatting (which is not viable in this text response)."},{"instruction":"Eine britische Astrophysikerin hat mit dem \\"Großen Ring\\" erneut eine gigantische Struktur aus Galaxien gefunden, die grundlegenden Annahmen zum Aufbau des Universums zu widersprechen scheint. Der Ring hat einen Durchmesser von 1,3 Milliarden Lichtjahren und einen Umfang von vier Milliarden Lichtjahren, das ist deutlich größer als die theoretische Maximalgröße von Strukturen im All, schreibt Alexia Lopez von der University of Central Lancashire. Die liegt bei 1,2 Milliarden Lichtjahren. Lopez hat mit dem \\"Großen Bogen\\" bereits vor drei Jahren eine 3,3 Milliarden Lichtjahre lange Reihe aus Galaxien entdeckt. Erstaunlich sei jetzt auch noch, dass die beiden Strukturen am Himmel vergleichsweise nahe beieinander liegen. Universum weniger gleichmäßig als angenommen Wie Lopez ausführt, hat sie auch die zweite Riesenstruktur mithilfe von Quasaren gefunden. Das sind aktive Kerne von Galaxien – die dort um ein Schwarzes Loch rasende Materie strahlt extrem hell. Wenn deren Licht auf dem Weg zu uns lichtschwächere Galaxien durchquert, werden die dadurch gewissermaßen angestrahlt. So hat sie ihre Positionen am Nachthimmel ermittelt, aus den Absorptionslinien von Magnesium II in dem Spektrum dieses Lichts hat sie die Entfernungen berechnet. Mit dieser Methode erhält sie eine 3D-Karte naher und ferner Galaxien, in der sie nun schon zum zweiten Mal eine Struktur entdeckt hat, die einer Grundannahme des kosmologischen Prinzips widerspricht. \\"Das kosmologische Prinzip geht davon aus, dass jeder Teil des Universums als guter Ausschnitt dessen betrachtet werden kann, was wir vom Rest des Universums erwarten\\", erklärt Lopez. Ab einer gewissen Größe sollte es deshalb keine Unregelmäßigkeiten mehr geben. Als diese Maximalgröße wurde die Grenze von 1,2 Milliarden Lichtjahren ermittelt, die Lopez' \\"Großer Ring\\" und \\"Großer Bogen\\" beide deutlich übertreffen. Eigentlich sei man davon ausgegangen, dass solche Strukturen nicht existieren dürften, zufällige Ausnahmen sollten entsprechend selten sein. Warum wir trotzdem bereits zwei kennen und das auch noch in derselben Region des Himmels, benötige eine Erklärung. Wie Lopez noch schreibt, erscheint der \\"Große Ring\\" als fast perfekter Kreis am Himmel, die dreidimensionale Struktur gleiche aber eher der eines Korkenziehers. Wenn man die Galaxien am Himmel sehen könnte, wären 15 Vollmonde nötig, um den Kreis abzudecken. Der \\"Große Bogen\\" wäre noch deutlich größer. Überraschend ist auch, dass die beiden Riesenstrukturen ungefähr gleich weit von uns entfernt sind, beide ungefähr neun Milliarden Lichtjahre. Mit unseren Modellen seien beide nur schwer zu erklären, meint Lopez noch: \\"Sie haben uns sicher etwas Wichtiges zu erzählen – aber was genau?\\" Vorgestellt hat sie ihre Entdeckung bei der Jahreskonferenz der American Astronomy Society.","output":"Die Entdeckung solcher gigantischen Strukturen im Universum durch die britische Astrophysikerin Alexia Lopez ist von großer Bedeutung für die Astrophysik und Kosmologie, da sie bestehende Theorien und Annahmen über die Struktur des Universums herausfordern. Der \\"Große Ring\\" mit einem Durchmesser von 1,3 Milliarden Lichtjahren und einem Umfang von vier Milliarden Lichtjahren sowie der \\"Große Bogen\\" mit einer Länge von 3,3 Milliarden Lichtjahren übersteigen die theoretische Maximalgröße für kosmische Strukturen von 1,2 Milliarden Lichtjahren, die im Rahmen des kosmologischen Prinzips angenommen wurde. Das kosmologische Prinzip besagt, dass das Universum auf großen Skalen homogen und isotrop ist – das bedeutet, dass es in allen Richtungen im Großen und Ganzen gleichförmig aussehen sollte. Diese Annahme bildet die Grundlage für das Standardmodell der Kosmologie, das verwendet wird, um das Universum und seine Entwicklung zu beschreiben. Die beiden riesigen Strukturen zu entdecken und zu beschreiben, war möglich durch die Untersuchung von Quasaren, deren extrem helles Licht Informationen über weiter entfernte, schwächer leuchtende Objekte wie Galaxien enthält, wenn es diese durchquert. Durch die Analyse von Absorptionslinien in den Spektren des Lichts von Quasaren konnte Alexia Lopez die Entfernungen und Positionen der Galaxien in einem dreidimensionalen Raum ermitteln und dadurch die massive Skalierung und Platzierung der \\"großen\\" Strukturen bestimmen. Die Entdeckungen stellen eine Herausforderung für bestehende Modelle des Universums dar, da sie darauf hindeuten, dass das Universum möglicherweise weniger gleichmäßig und uniform ist, als bisher angenommen wurde. Die merkwürdige Nähe der beiden Strukturen zueinander und ihre ungefähre Gleichzeitigkeit in der Entfernung von der Erde fügen zusätzlich Fragen hinzu, die möglicherweise neue Theorien oder Anpassungen an bestehende Modelle erfordern. Die Präsentation dieser Entdeckungen auf der Jahreskonferenz der American Astronomy Society ist ein wichtiger Schritt, um die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft über diese Beobachtungen zu informieren und Diskussionen anzuregen, die zu einem besseren Verständnis des Universums und seiner Entwicklung beitragen könnten. Solche Entdeckungen ermöglichen es, unsere Modelle zu überprüfen und gegebenenfalls zu erweitern, um die Realität des Kosmos besser abzubilden."},{"instruction":"Warum hast du den angegebenen Textihalt umformuliert wiedergegeben?

Par exemple, dans votre composant \`CarteProgrammation\`, l'état \\"exit\\" est déclenché seulement si \`isSwitching\` est \`true\`. 4. **Inspectez le rendering conditionnel** : Assurez-vous que le composant qui doit animer vers l'état \\"exit\\" est toujours présent dans le DOM au moment où l'animation doit se déclencher. 5. **Consultez la console pour des erreurs** : Vérifiez si des messages d'erreur ou des avertissements apparaissent dans la console du navigateur qui pourraient suggérer ce qui ne fonctionne pas. 6. **Utilisez \`useEffect\` pour suivre les changements d'état** : Ajoutez des hooks \`useEffect\` pour surveiller \`isHovered\`, \`isSwitching\`, \`props.comesFromPageArtist\` et autres états reliés pour voir s'ils changent comme attendu lors des interactions. 7. **Revérifiez la logique de navigation** : Assurez-vous que le lien \`<Link>\` fonctionne correctement et permet au composant de se mettre à jour correctement après la navigation. 8. **Inspectez la hiérarchie des composants** : Confirmez que le composant \`AnimatePresence\` de Framer Motion entoure vos composants animés pour permettre les animations d'entrée et de sortie. 9. **Console.log pour le debugging** : Utilisez \`console.log\` pour suivre les valeurs des variables clés, des dimensions du composant (\`refCarte.current\`), et du cycle de vie du composant pour comprendre où le flux ne fonctionne pas comme prévu. 10. **Vérifiez les styles CSS** : Inspectez les styles CSS appliqués aux composants pour s'assurer qu'ils ne sont pas en conflit avec les animations de Framer Motion. 11. **Vérifiez les animations conditionnelles** : Si des animations conditionnelles sont employées, assurez-vous que les conditions sont évaluées correctement.

Par exemple, vérifiez que les valeurs animées dans \`exit\` sont celles que vous attendez pour l'effet d'ouverture de la carte. 2. **Vérifiez la logique de l'état \`isSwitching\`** : L'état \`isSwitching\` est utilisé pour contrôler si le composant doit s'animer vers l'état \`exit\`. Ajoutez un \`useEffect\` pour observer les changements de \`isSwitching\`: \`\`\`jsx useEffect(() => { console.log('isSwitching a changé:', isSwitching); }, [isSwitching]); \`\`\` En interagissant avec le composant, vérifiez que \`isSwitching\` change de \`false\` à \`true\` au moment dit. 3. **Vérifiez que \`refCarte.current\` est défini** : Puisque vous utilisez \`refCarte.current?.offsetLeft\` et \`refCarte.current?.offsetTop\` dans les variants \`exit\`, il est important d'assurer que \`refCarte.current\` est bien défini. 4. **Vérifiez la présence d'\`AnimatePresence\`** : Pour que les animations d'entrée et de sortie fonctionnent avec Framer Motion, votre composant doit être enveloppé par \`AnimatePresence\`. Sans cela, l'état \`exit\` ne se déclenchera pas. \`\`\`jsx import { AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion'; // ... <AnimatePresence> {/* votre component ici */} </AnimatePresence> \`\`\` 5. **Vérifiez la navigation** : Avec \`react-router-dom\`, les navigations peuvent entraîner des changements qui ne sont pas toujours compatibles avec les animations de sortie de Framer Motion. Assurez-vous que le \`Link\` ne provoque pas un rechargement de page qui pourrait empêcher l'animation. 6. **Observer la séquence d'animations** : Placez des \`console.log\` avant et après les appels aux fonctions changeant \`isSwitching\` pour mieux suivre la séquence d'événements. 7. **Inspecter les règles CSS** : Vérifiez que les règles CSS n'interfèrent pas avec les animations, surtout celles qui déterminent la visibilité, la position, ou la z-index des éléments. 8. **Étudiez les transitions enfants-parents** : Si votre composant animé a des enfants également animés avec \`motion\`, soyez prudent avec les animations simultanées. Framer Motion harmonise les animations enfants-parents, ce qui pourrait affecter le comportement attendu. 9. **S'assurer que l'état \`exit\` est bien déclenché** : Il pourrait y avoir un problème où l'état \`exit\` est déclenché, mais l'animation ne s'exécute pas correctement. Revérifiez si l'état \`exit\` est correctement appliqué. Utilisez également le \`useEffect\` pour logger si l'état \`initial\` et \`animate\` sont appliqués comme prévu. 10. **Utiliser les outils de développement** : Ouvrez les DevTools de votre navigateur et inspectez les éléments pour comprendre pourquoi les animations ne se déroulent pas comme prévu. Vous pouvez également utiliser la timeline des animations dans certains navigateurs pour examiner le détail des animations CSS ou de Framer Motion et déterminer où elles pourraient échouer. Enfin, identifiez si le composant est correctement rendu lors de la navigation, ou s'il est immédiatement démonté, ce qui empêcherait toute animation de sortie de s'exécuter."},{"instruction":"dans ce code, quel partie correspond à l'animation de la card qui s'ouvre pleine page ?

Sans \`AnimatePresence\`, l'état \`exit\` ne sera pas déclenché correctement. 2. **État isSwitching**: Vérifiez que l'état \`isSwitching\` est correctement mis à jour lors du clic. Si \`isSwitching\` ne passe pas à \`true\`, l'état \`exit\` pour vos animations ne sera pas activé. 3. **Utilisation de \`initial\`, \`animate\` et \`exit\`**: Assurez-vous que les propriétés \`initial\`, \`animate\` et \`exit\` du composant \`motion.img\` sont configurées correctement et que l'animation sur l'échelle (agrandissement) est incluse dans l'état \`exit\` si c'est ce que vous souhaitez lors du clic. 4. **Les mises à jour de State sur la Navigation**: Dans React Router, naviguer vers une nouvelle route peut provoquer le montage de nouveaux composants et le démontage des anciens. Vérifiez que l'état de votre composant \`CarteProgrammation\` est conservé lors de la navigation, ou passez les données nécessaires à l'animation via le \`state\` de l'objet \`Link\`. 5. **Timing des Animations**: Si l'animation de l'image fonctionne lors du retour et non lors du clic initial, cela peut suggérer que le timing est en jeu. Peut-être que l'animation d'entrée est déclenchée trop rapidement, avant que l'état \`exit\` n'ait la chance de s'exécuter. 6. **Rendu conditionnel**: Les composants en train de quitter la scène pour une nouvelle route peuvent être démontés avant que leur animation ne s'achève. Ceci pourrait interrompre l'animation d'agrandissement de l'image. 7. **Logique du bouton Retour**: Si le bouton \\"Retour\\" rétablit l'état de certaines propriétés qui affectent l'animation (comme \`isHovered\` ou \`isSwitching\`), cela peut expliquer pourquoi l'animation se comporte différemment lorsque vous revenez vers cette composante. Pour mieux comprendre le problème, vous pouvez ajouter des \`console.log\` pour surveiller les changements de state et des breakpoints dans les DevTools de votre navigateur afin de débugger le comportement des animations pas à pas.

Les animations définies dans le code sont pour l'opacité (\`infosVariants\`) et un gradient de fond (\`overlayVariants\`), pas pour une transformation en pleine page. Cependant, vous mentionnez que l'image doit s'agrandir lors du clic sur la carte artiste. Cela signifierait que l'animation doit être définie quelque part dans le code de la \`CarteProgrammation\`, et que les états passés (comme \`oldX\` et \`oldY\`) sont utilisés pour animer le composant à sa nouvelle position sur la page \`PageEvenement\`. Pour que cette transition en pleine page se produise avec une image s'agrandissant, vous devez vous assurer de plusieurs choses : 1. **State Passé avec \`Link\`**: Le \`state\` que vous passez avec le composant \`Link\` doit contenir les paramètres nécessaires pour animer l'image depuis sa position originale sur la page précédente (\`CarteProgrammation\`) vers sa nouvelle position et dimension sur \`PageEvenement\`. 2. **Réception des State dans \`PageEvenement\`**: Vérifiez que vous utilisez bien les valeurs passées dans \`location.state\` pour initialiser l'animation sur la page \`PageEvenement\`. Si vous souhaitez que l'image s'agrandisse à la taille de la page, vos variants ou logique d'animation doivent utiliser ces valeurs pour déterminer la position et l'échelle de départ de l'animation. Par exemple : \`\`\`jsx const imageVariants = { exit: (custom) => ({ x: custom.oldX, y: custom.oldY, width: \\"100vw\\", // pleine largeur height: \\"100vh\\", // pleine hauteur transition: { duration: 0.4 } }) }; <motion.img src={\\"images/test-travis.png\\"} alt=\\"image de fond\\" animate=\\"exit\\" custom={{ oldX, oldY }} variants={imageVariants} /> \`\`\` 3. **Utilisation d'\`AnimatePresence\`**: Si l'animation doit déclencher au moment de l'ouverture de \`PageEvenement\`, vous auriez besoin d'utiliser \`AnimatePresence\` pour envelopper les transitions entre les routes, probablement au niveau de votre routeur React Router. 4. **Utilisation des bonnes propriétés**: Assurez-vous d'utiliser les bonnes propriétés pour l'animation d'ouverture de la carte. Par exemple, vous devriez animer des propriétés comme \`width\`, \`height\`, \`top\`, \`left\`, \`x\`, et \`y\` pour simuler une animation de carte qui prend tout l'écran.

Cela est nécessaire pour les animations de sortie, car \`AnimatePresence\` permet à Framer Motion de savoir quand un composant animé est en train de quitter le DOM. 2. **Coordination des animations entre les pages**: Pour que l'animation d'ouverture fonctionne de manière synchronisée avec la navigation, vous devez gérer correctement les états et les animations à la fois sur la \`CarteProgrammation\` et sur la \`PageEvenement\`. Cela implique généralement de passer des informations d'état via le \`location.state\` de React Router pour initialiser les valeurs de départ de l'animation sur la nouvelle page. 3. **Le déclenchement de l'état \`exit\`**: Sur la \`CarteProgrammation\`, lorsque vous réglez \`isSwitching\` sur \`true\`, ce changement d'état doit déclencher l'animation d'exit. Cependant, parce qu'une redirection est initiée par le \`Link\`, il est possible que la page soit démontée avant que l'animation d'exit ne soit complétée. 4. **Présence des valeurs attendues dans \`PageEvenement\`**: Sur la \`PageEvenement\`, vous devez vous assurer que les valeurs passées telles que \`oldX\`, \`oldY\`, et les autres valeurs attendues sont reçues et utilisées correctement pour animer l'élément à son nouvel état. Le \`useEffect\` pourrait être utilisé ici pour définir les animations initiales en fonction de ces valeurs. Compte tenu de ces éléments, la raison pour laquelle l'animation d'entrée (de la \`CarteProgrammation\` vers la \`PageEvenement\`) ne fonctionne pas aussi bien que l'animation de sortie (quand vous revenez à la \`CarteProgrammation\` depuis la \`PageEvenement\`) peut inclure : - **Le composant est détaché trop tôt** : Le composant \`CarteProgrammation\` peut être retiré du DOM avant que l'animation d'exit ne termine, probablement à cause de la navigation rapide due au \`Link\`. - **Les valeurs passées ne sont pas récupérées correctement** : Il est possible que les valeurs nécessaires pour l'animation d'entrée sur \`PageEvenement\` ne soient pas récupérées ou utilisées correctement. - **Il manque \`AnimatePresence\` au niveau approprié** : Cela pourrait être dû à l’absence de \`AnimatePresence\` autour des composants qui montent et démontent lors des transitions de route. Si les animations fonctionnent pour le retour mais pas pour l'entrée, cela pourrait être dû à un problème de synchronisation ou de cycle de vie des composants. Pour y remédier : - Vérifiez l'ordre dans lequel les composants sont montés et démontés. - Assurez-vous que \`isSwitching\` est mis à \`true\` avant de naviguer vers la nouvelle page. - Utilisez les hooks de cycle de vie (\`useEffect\`) pour initialiser les animations d'entrée avec les bonnes valeurs dès que la \`PageEvenement\` est montée. - Considérez l'utilisation de techniques supplémentaires pour retarder la navigation jusqu'à ce que l'animation d'exit soit complétée. Par exemple, vous pouvez empêcher le comportement par défaut du \`Link\` et contrôler la navigation programmée après l'animation. Finalement, la présence et le rôle d'\`AnimatePresence\` doivent être examinés avec soin pour s'assurer que les composants animés ont l'opportunité de compléter leurs animations avant d'être démontés. Si nécessaire, placez \`AnimatePresence\` dans le composant parent qui s'occupe de montrer ou cacher \`CarteProgrammation\` et \`PageEvenement\`."},{"instruction":"j'aimerais console log la refCurrent : import { motion } from 'framer-motion' import {useState,useRef, useEffect} from 'react' import { Link } from 'react-router-dom' type Props = { id:number|undefined, date: string, heure: string, nomArtiste: string, setIsNavTransparent: (isNavTransparent : boolean) => void; comesFromPageArtist?: boolean; oldX?: number; oldY?: number; oldGroupes?: Groupe[]; description?: string; } type Groupe = { idG: number; nomG: string; descriptionG: string; datePassage: string; heurePassage: string; } export default function CarteProgrammation(props: Props) { const nomArtiste = props.nomArtiste.toUpperCase().split(\\" \\") const[isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false) const[isSwitching, setIsSwitching] = useState(false) const[delay, setDelay] = useState(props.comesFromPageArtist?

Pour ce faire, il faut que vous ayez une manière de déterminer lesquels de vos données représentent des artistes et lesquels représentent des groupes. En général, cette distinction est basée sur votre modèle de données ou les données elles-mêmes que vous recevez du backend. Par exemple, si votre endpoint \\"/getSocialLinksGroupe/\\" renvoie des données qui contiennent un certain champ (ex: \`type\`) qui indique s'il s'agit d'un groupe ou d'un artiste. Si un tel champ est présent, vous pouvez l’utiliser pour conditionner l’exécution de requêtes API spécifiques ou le rendu de composants spécifiques. Si je comprends bien votre code et votre question, il semble que vous ayez déjà une certaine manière de distinction entre les groupes et les artistes dans votre frontend, basée sur les réponses que vous recevez de vos endpoints. Vous pourriez adapter votre appel API et votre état de composant comme suit pour inclure et vérifier ce champ \`type\`: \`\`\`jsx useEffect(() => { // Exemple d'endroit où on détermine si c'est un groupe ou un artiste const isGroup = /* une certaine logique pour déterminer si c'est un groupe */; const endpoint = isGroup ? \`http://localhost:8080/getSocialLinksGroupe/{idArtiste}\` : \`http://localhost:8080/getSocialLinksArtiste/{idArtiste}\`; // Remplacer par le bon endpoint pour les artistes axios.get(endpoint) .then((response) => { setSocialLinks(response.data); }) .catch((error) => { console.error(\\"Erreur lors de la récupération des liens de réseaux sociaux\\", error); }); }, [idArtiste]); // ... // Aussi, vous auriez dans votre état un champ indiquant le type actuel affiché, e.g.: const [currentType, setCurrentType] = useState<'group' | 'artist'>('group'); // Plus loin dans votre code, vous pouvez maintenant vérifier le type actuel pour décider quoi afficher // Exemple : return ( <div> {currentType === 'group' ? <GroupComponent ... /> : <ArtistComponent ... />} </div> ); \`\`\` La logique que vous utiliserez pour déterminer si \`isGroup\` doit être \`true\` ou \`false\` dépend des données spécifiques que vous obtenez et comment elles sont structurées. Il est également important de noter que les informations concernant si l’id récupéré depuis les params de l’URL appartient à un artiste ou à un groupe devraient idéalement être conservées quelque part dans votre application (soit dans le state global avec un state manager comme Redux, soit passées via les props ou via le state de navigation de React Router).

Cette approche est fréquemment utilisée pour permettre aux composants de savoir comment se comporter ou présenter des informations en se basant sur des données passées. Pour ce faire, vous pouvez ajouter une prop telle que \`type\` à votre composant \`CarteProgrammation\` et passer la valeur \`\\"artiste\\"\` ou \`\\"groupe\\"\` lorsque vous l'utilisez dans votre liste. Par exemple : Modification du type Props : \`\`\`typescript type Props = { // ... autres props // Ajout de la prop \\"type\\" type: 'artiste' | 'groupe'; }; \`\`\` Puis, lorsque vous utilisez le composant \`CarteProgrammation\` dans la \`Programmation\` : \`\`\`jsx <CarteProgrammation // ... autres props type=\\"groupe\\" // ou \\"artiste\\" selon l'entité /> \`\`\` Dans votre composant \`CarteProgrammation\`, vous pourrez ensuite utiliser cette prop pour exécuter une logique ou des appels API conditionnels, par exemple : \`\`\`jsx useEffect(() => { if (props.type === \\"groupe\\") { // Appel API pour récupérer les informations du groupe axios.get(\`http://localhost:8080/getSocialLinksGroupe/{props.id}\`) .then(response => { // gestion de la réponse pour un groupe }) .catch(error => { // gestion de l'erreur }); } else if (props.type === \\"artiste\\") { // Appel API pour récupérer les informations de l'artiste axios.get(\`http://localhost:8080/getSocialLinksArtiste/{props.id}\`) .then(response => { // gestion de la réponse pour un artiste }) .catch(error => { // gestion de l'erreur }); } }, [props.id, props.type]); \`\`\` Cela permet une meilleure flexibilité et réutilisabilité de votre composant car il pourra gérer différents types d'entités en se basant sur une simple prop. De plus, cela vous permet de garder la logique concernant les différences entre artistes et groupes à l'extérieur du composant, rendant le code plus propre et plus maintenable."},{"instruction":"mais comment passer la props a PageEvenement ?

These norms often included marriage at ages that would be considered child marriage by today's standards. However, the Bible does not explicitly \\"allow\\" child marriage in the sense of giving direct instructions or commandments that endorse the practice. In the Old Testament and New Testament, there are various passages that mention marriage, but they typically do not specify the ages of the individuals involved. Here are a few passages that reflect the historical context where younger marriages may have been common: 1. **Isaac and Rebekah** - In Genesis 24, Isaac marries Rebekah. While their ages are not specified, it was customary in ancient times for girls to marry soon after reaching puberty. 2. **Mary and Joseph** - In the New Testament, Mary is described as a young virgin betrothed to Joseph when she becomes pregnant with Jesus through the Holy Spirit (Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 1:26-38). While Mary's exact age is not given, it is often inferred that she may have been very young by modern standards due to the cultural practices of the time. It is important to note that these descriptions do not serve as prescriptions or endorsements; they simply reflect the societal norms of the periods in which the biblical events took place. Today, child marriage is widely condemned as it infringes on the rights and well-being of children. Many countries have laws that set a minimum age for marriage in order to prevent child marriage and protect children's rights. Interpreting the Bible should be done with an understanding of the historical and cultural context and with the recognition of modern ethical standards. Most contemporary Christian denominations do not condone child marriage and support the protection of children's rights. They would interpret the principles of love, consent, and respect found in the Bible as incompatible with the practice of child marriage."},{"instruction":"Physical therapy names include “truHealth”","output":"When choosing a name for a physical therapy practice like \\"truHealth,\\" it's important to consider a few characteristics that make the name effective and memorable. A name should ideally: 1. Reflect the services provided – Incorporating elements that suggest physical well-being or rehabilitation can be useful. 2. Be easy to remember and pronounce – This helps with word-of-mouth referrals and brand recognition. 3. Be unique enough to stand out – A distinctive name helps differentiate from competitors. 4. Resonate with the target audience – It should appeal to the demographics you aim to serve. 5. Be legally available – Ensure no other business has the same name to avoid trademark infringement issues.

This corresponds to the probability of (1 - 0.03) / 2 = 0.485 since we're looking at both tails of the normal distribution. We need to look up the Z-value that corresponds to an area of 0.485 + 0.5 = 0.985 in the standard normal distribution table. The Z-value that corresponds to this area is approximately 2.17. Now let's calculate the standard error (SE): SE = √(p̂(1-p̂)/n) SE = √(0.492*(1-0.492)/500) SE = √(0.492*0.508/500) SE = √(0.250056/500) SE = √(0.0005001) SE = 0.02236 (rounded to five decimal places for accuracy) Finally, we calculate the 97% confidence interval: CI = p̂ ± Z * SE CI = 0.492 ± 2.17 * 0.02236 CI = 0.492 ± 0.048522 Now let's compute the lower and upper bounds: Lower bound = 0.492 - 0.048522 = 0.443478 (rounded to 0.443) Upper bound = 0.492 + 0.048522 = 0.540522 (rounded to 0.541) The 97% confidence interval for the proportion of IT girls in Palestine is approximately [0.443, 0.541].

The standard error (SE) for the proportion is calculated using: [ SE = sqrt{frac{p(1-p)}{n}} ] where ( n ) is the sample size, which in this case is 500. So: [ SE = sqrt{frac{0.492 times (1 - 0.492)}{500}} ] [ SE = sqrt{frac{0.492 times 0.508}{500}} ] [ SE = sqrt{frac{0.249936}{500}} ] [ SE = sqrt{0.000499872} ] [ SE = 0.022355 ] (rounded to five decimal places) For a 97% confidence interval, we look for the Z-value associated with a 97% confidence level.

Einige der am häufigsten verfügbaren legalen Drogen sind: 1. **Alkohol**: In vielen Formen erhältlich, u.a. als Bier, Wein und Spirituosen. Der Verkauf und Konsum von Alkohol ist ab 18 Jahren legal, mit Ausnahme von Bier, Wein und Sekt ab 16 Jahren. 2. **Nikotin/Tabak**: Erhältlich als Zigaretten, Zigarillos, Zigarren, Pfeifentabak, Schnupftabak und mehr. Der Erwerb und Konsum von Tabakprodukten ist ab 18 Jahren legal. 3. **Koffein**: Gefunden in Kaffee, Tee, einigen Softdrinks, Energiegetränken und Medikamenten. Koffein ist vollkommen legal und keine Altersbeschränkung für den Kauf besteht, obwohl einige Diskussionen um Energiegetränke geführt werden. 4. **Medikamente/Pharmaka**: Viele verschreibungspflichtige und rezeptfreie Medikamente haben psychoaktive Wirkungen. Einige können missbräuchlich verwendet werden, um einen Rausch zu erzeugen oder andere nicht-therapeutische Effekte zu erzielen. Die Verwendung von Medikamenten ist jedoch streng reguliert und der Missbrauch kann illegal sein. 5. **Neue psychoaktive Substanzen (NPS)**: Dies ist eine breite Kategorie, die sogenannte \\"Legal Highs\\" oder \\"Research Chemicals\\" umfasst. Diese Substanzen sind oft legal, da sie neu synthetisiert werden und nicht speziell in den Kontrollgesetzen aufgeführt sind. Die Gesetzgebung versucht jedoch, mit der Entstehung neuer Substanzen Schritt zu halten, und viele dieser Substanzen werden schnell illegal, nachdem sie identifiziert wurden. 6. **Schnüffelstoffe**: Stoffe wie Klebstoffe, Lacke und Lösungsmittel, die inhaliert werden können, um einen Rauschzustand zu erzielen. Obwohl der Verkauf der Stoffe an und für sich legal ist, ist der Missbrauch zum Zwecke des High-Werdens oft rechtlich eingeschränkt. 7. **Kratom & Kava**: Natürliche Substanzen, die psychoaktive Wirkungen haben können. Sie sind in manchen Kreisen beliebt, allerdings unterliegen sie häufig rechtlichen Grey Areas und es kann zu legalen Änderungen kommen. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass nur der legale Besitz und Konsum diese Substanzen legal macht. Ihr Missbrauch kann zu rechtlichen Problemen, Gesundheitsschäden und Abhängigkeit führen. Zudem gibt es für viele Substanzen spezifische Vorschriften, die Alterseinschränkungen und Verkaufsbeschränkungen beinhalten. Ferner passen Gesetzgeber die Rechtslage immer wieder an, um den Missbrauch von legalen Substanzen zu bekämpfen oder bestimmte gefährliche Substanzen zu reglementieren, weshalb sich der rechtliche Status von bestimmten Substanzen schnell ändern kann."},{"instruction":"Tạo cho tôi 1 code vòng quay may mắn có mũi tên và mỗi tài khoản chỉ được quay 1 lần có giải thưởng 1000vnd , 2000vnd ,3000vnd , 4000vnd , 5000vnd, có sử dụng database mysql khi người dùng quay được vào số tiền bao nhiêu thì sẽ công vào số dư tài khoản và lưu vào database , có sử dụng thêm css để trang trí hãy viết dùm tôi luôn database chạy trên Aapanle","output":"Tạo một vòng quay may mắn như bạn mô tả đòi hỏi nhiều bước khác nhau: thiết kế cơ sở dữ liệu, tạo giao diện người dùng, viết logic trò chơi và kết hợp với hệ thống ngân hàng.

Most Christian denominations and scholars interpret the Bible as a text that promotes peace, compassion, and love among people. Using the Bible or any religious text to justify violence or terrorism is a misinterpretation and misuse of the scripture. Terrorism is fundamentally at odds with the core message of Christianity, which is about love, sacrifice, and peace. Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, such as the Sermon on the Mount, emphasize pacifism, mercy, and forgiveness. Here are a few verses that illustrate these principles: 1. **Matthew 5:9** - \\"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.\\" 2. **Matthew 5:44** - \\"But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\\" 3. **Romans 12:17-21** - \\"Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath...\\" 4. **1 John 4:8** - \\"Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.\\" 5. **Luke 6:27-31** - \\"But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you...\\" 6. **Matthew 26:52** - \\"'Put your sword back in its place,' Jesus said to him, 'for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.'\\" 7. **Proverbs 10:12** - \\"Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs.\\" 8. **Romans 14:19** - \\"Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.\\" 9. **Hebrews 12:14** - \\"Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.\\" 10. **James 3:18** - \\"Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.\\" 11. **Ephesians 4:31-32** - \\"Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.\\" 12. **Psalms 34:14** - \\"Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.\\" 13. **1 Peter 3:11** - \\"They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it.\\" 14. **2 Timothy 2:24** - \\"And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.\\" 15. **1 Thessalonians 5:15** - \\"Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.\\" I've provided these verses to show that the Christian scripture, in its traditional and widely accepted interpretation, advocates for peace and condemns acts of violence.

We no longer rely on \`'ar'\` existing to define \`'ru'\`. You'll need to decide how you want to handle cases where there is no existing Arabic localization — whether to fill in the default placeholder values as shown above, or use another approach. Make sure to pass this updated \`add_l10n()\` function to replace the old one in the script you have and rerun the script to generate the new JSON output.

Here is the updated \`add_l10n()\` function that adds \`ru\` localizations based on existing \`ar\` localizations and uses \`\\"RU\\"\` as a placeholder: \`\`\`python def add_l10n(obj): if 'l10n' not in obj: obj['l10n'] = {'ar': {}, 'ru': {}} ar_l10n = obj['l10n'].get('ar', {}) ru_l10n = obj['l10n'].get('ru', {}) # If 'ar' localization exists but 'ru' does not, create 'ru' localization if ar_l10n and not ru_l10n: obj['l10n']['ru'] = {key: \\"RU\\" for key in ar_l10n.keys()} elif ru_l10n and not ar_l10n: # This checks if 'ru' exists but not 'ar', may not be needed obj['l10n']['ar'] = {key: \\"AR\\" for key in ru_l10n.keys()} # If neither 'ar' nor 'ru' localization exists, do not add placeholder values \`\`\` This modification will fill in any missing \`ru\` entries with \\"RU\\" provided that the corresponding \`ar\` entries exist. To apply this updated function to each localization object, you'll also need to update the \`process_component_data()\` function and any other functions in the original script that process components and validators, to make sure they call this updated \`add_l10n()\` function. Make sure to replace the old \`add_l10n()\` with this updated one in your script, and this should result in having both \`ar\` and \`ru\` localizations populated across your JSON file after re-running the script. Remember to always backup your JSON data before running any scripts that modify it."},{"instruction":"hey there gpt 4, explain to me the entire topic of \\"electricty and magnetism\\" in highschool physics","output":"Hey! I'd be happy to give you an overview of electricity and magnetism as typically taught in high school physics. This topic is a fundamental part of physics and deals with the study of electric charges at rest and in motion, the forces they exert, the fields they create, and their interactions with materials and with magnetic fields. **Electricity:** 1. **Electric Charge**: Electricity begins with the concept of electric charge. There are two types of charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. 2. **Conductors and Insulators**: Materials that allow charges to move freely are called conductors (e.g., metals), while those that don't are insulators (e.g., rubber, plastic). 3. **Electric Force**: The force between charges is described by Coulomb's Law, which quantifies the attractive or repulsive force between two point charges. 4. **Electric Field**: The electric field describes the force a charge would experience at any point in space. It is represented by electric field lines starting from positive charges and ending at negative charges. 5. **Electric Potential (Voltage)**: Electric potential energy arises from interactions between charges, and the electric potential is the energy per unit charge. It is measured in volts. 6. **Ohm’s Law**: This law relates the voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in a simple circuit: V = IR. 7. **Series and Parallel Circuits**: Components can be connected in series (end-to-end) or parallel (side-by-side), which affects the total resistance and the way the voltage is distributed. 8. **Electric Power**: Power in an electric circuit is given by P = IV, where P is the power in watts, I is the current in amperes, and V is the voltage in volts. **Magnetism:** 1. **Magnetic Poles**: Magnets have north and south poles. Like electric charges, like poles repel, and unlike poles attract. 2. **Magnetic Fields**: These are created by moving electric charges or intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property called spin. The magnetic field is represented by field lines, just as the electric field is. 3. **Electromagnetism**: An electric current produces a magnetic field, and a magnetic field can induce an electric current in a conductor. This relationship is the basis for many technologies, like generators and electric motors. 4. **Faraday’s Law of Induction**: This law states that a changing magnetic field within a closed loop induces an electromotive force (emf) which can drive an electric current. 5. **Lenz's Law**: This is related to Faraday’s Law and states that the induced emf generates a current that opposes the change in magnetic flux that created it. **Electromagnetic Force:** 1. **Lorentz Force**: The force exerted on a charged particle moving through an electric and a magnetic field is called the Lorentz force, combining both electric and magnetic effects. 2. **Maxwell’s Equations**: These are a set of four equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents. **Light and Electromagnetic Radiation:** 1. **Electromagnetic Waves**: Changes in electric and magnetic fields can propagate through space as waves at the speed of light, which includes a wide spectrum of radiation from radio waves to gamma rays. **Applications:** The principles of electricity and magnetism are applied in numerous devices and technologies including motors, transformers, televisions, radios, and even the transmission of electrical power from power plants to homes. Understanding electricity and magnetism involves considerable use of vector calculus and differential equations at advanced levels. In high school, these concepts are usually presented in a more simplified form, employing algebra and basic trigonometry to work through the fundamental principles and solve problems. The depth of knowledge in this topic can range from qualitative descriptions to quantitative analyses involving calculations and experiments. It's a rich and exciting part of physics that explains a lot about the world around us and the technology we use every day."},{"instruction":"can you also explain to me the equations that are in this topic?","output":"Certainly! Here are some of the key equations associated with electricity and magnetism, particularly those that are typically covered at the high school level: **Electricity:** 1. **Coulomb's Law**: Describes the electric force (F) between two charges (q1 and q2) separated by a distance (r). [ F = k frac{|q_1 cdot q_2|}{r^2} ] where ( k ) is Coulomb's constant ( (approx 8.9875 times 10^9 , text{N·m}^2/text{C}^2) ). 2. **Electric Field (E)**: The field created by a charge ( q ) at a distance ( r ).

[ mathcal{E} = -frac{dPhi_B}{dt} ] 2. **Lenz's Law**: The direction of the induced emf is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it, hence the negative sign in Faraday's Law. 3. **Magnetic Flux (Φ)**: The total magnetic field that passes through a given area (A). [ Phi_B = B cdot A cdot cos(theta) ] where ( B ) is the magnetic field strength, ( A ) is the area, and ( theta ) is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to the area. **Maxwell's Equations:** While these advanced equations are typically beyond high school physics, they are the fundamental laws of electromagnetism and are provided here for completeness. 1. **Gauss's Law (Electric):** Relates electric field and electric charge. [ oint_{S} vec{E} cdot dvec{A} = frac{Q_{text{enc}}}{varepsilon_0} ] 2. **Gauss's Law (Magnetic):** States there are no magnetic monopoles. [ oint_{S} vec{B} cdot dvec{A} = 0 ] 3. **Faraday's Law (Maxwell's version):** Relates a changing magnetic field to an induced electric field. [ oint_{C} vec{E} cdot dvec{l} = -frac{d}{dt}int_{S} vec{B} cdot dvec{A} ] 4. **Ampere's Law with Maxwell's Addition:** Relates current and a changing electric field to a magnetic field. [ oint_{C} vec{B} cdot dvec{l} = mu_0 I_{text{enc}} + mu_0 varepsilon_0 frac{d}{dt}int_{S} vec{E} cdot dvec{A} ] In these equations, ( varepsilon_0 ) is the permittivity of free space, and ( mu_0 ) is the permeability of free space. Each of these equations and principles has significant theoretical and practical implications and represents a piece of the larger puzzle of understanding electrical and magnetic phenomena. High school physics tends to focus on teaching the basic equations and concepts that allow students to calculate and reason about electric and magnetic phenomena in a variety of contexts."},{"instruction":"ples dont write it on latex markdown","output":"Of course, let's go over these equations in plain text, which will be more accessible. **Electricity:** 1. **Coulomb's Law**: Describes the electric force (F) between two charges (q1 and q2) separated by a distance (r).

Here's how it works and why the term \\"large electric discharge\\" is appropriate: 1. **Charge Separation**: Within a thundercloud, there are various processes, such as rising and falling air currents, water droplets colliding, and ice crystals forming, which contribute to a separation of electric charges. Typically, positive charges accumulate near the top of the cloud, and negative charges gather at the bottom. 2. **Electric Field Build-Up**: As the charge separation becomes more pronounced, an intense electric field builds up between the different parts of the cloud, as well as between the cloud and the ground. This electric field can be much stronger than the electric field that's required to ionize air, which is about 3 million volts per meter. 3. **Ionization of Air**: When the electric field's strength exceeds the breakdown voltage of air, a process of ionization occurs, in which the air molecules are stripped of electrons, creating a channel of plasma. This channel of plasma is known as a leader stroke, which can propagate rapidly towards the ground. 4. **Discharge**: The leader stroke effectively closes the circuit between the cloud and the ground, and a massive surge of electrons rushes downward to neutralize the difference in charge. This sudden flow of charge is what we observe as a lightning bolt. 5. **Energy and Power**: The amount of charge moved in a lightning strike can be enormous (on the order of about 5 coulombs, although this can vary widely), and it happens over a very short timespan - typically a fraction of a second. Additionally, the voltage involved in a lightning strike is extremely high (typically hundreds of millions of volts). Consequently, the power output (voltage times current) is immense, leading to an instantaneous release of energy that can exceed a billion joules. This is equivalent to approximately 200 kilograms of TNT. 6. **Visible and Audible Effects**: The energy from lightning heats the air to temperatures higher than the surface of the sun, causing the air to expand explosively. This expansion results in the thunder we hear after the visible lightning strike due to the shockwaves created in the atmosphere. Due to the extreme amounts of energy involved, the rapid movement of massive charges, and the significant effects they have on their surroundings, lightning strikes are often regarded as one of nature's most impressive and powerful examples of large electric discharges."},{"instruction":"can you explain it in simple terms?","output":"Absolutely, let’s put it in simpler terms: Think of a thundercloud as a big, fluffy battery with a bunch of electric charge building up inside it. Some parts of the cloud get a negative charge (like the minus end of a battery) and other parts get a positive charge (like the plus end). Now, just like the negative and positive ends of a battery want to connect, so do those charges in the cloud. But the air in between them usually acts like a barrier, not letting the charges easily flow. However, when the cloud gets very charged up and the difference between the positive and negative parts is really big, the air can’t stop the charges anymore. That's when lightning happens. This is where it gets cool: the charges make a kind of invisible path through the air that breaks down the air barrier, letting the electricity flow through. This path zaps down toward the ground really fast. When this zap – which is the lightning – happens, it's like a huge amount of electric current (which is a lot of charged particles) rushing through the air all at once. Because it involves such a huge rush of electricity, we call it a \\"large electric discharge.\\" And, because all that electricity is moving super fast, it heats up the air to an insanely high temperature, and that makes the bright flash we see and creates a shock wave that makes the loud boom of thunder we hear after the lightning. So, lightning is a giant spark of electricity in the sky, and the reason it’s so big and powerful is just that there’s a whole lot of charge trying to move from the sky to the ground in an instant!"},{"instruction":"What is Stonly?","output":"Stonly is an interactive guide platform that enables organizations to create step-by-step tutorials, guides, and walkthroughs to help users understand their products, services, or any complex process.

The survey will take approximately 5 minutes to complete, and all your responses will be kept strictly confidential. What could be some Physiological Attitudinal indicators question for this survey? where can I find this type of questions? Can you give some particular sources?","output":"Physiological attitudinal indicators are quite difficult to measure in a survey since they typically refer to automatic, often unconscious, bodily responses, such as heart rate, pupil dilation, or sweating. Surveys rely on self-reported information and, therefore, cannot directly capture actual physiological responses. However, you might be asking about psychological attitudinal indicators, which reflect a person's thoughts, beliefs, and feelings toward an object or situation and can be measured via self-reported survey questions. When evaluating users' willingness to choose pooling options in ridesharing, especially in a city like Dhaka, you can create questions that indirectly gauge their psychological attitudes. Here are some example questions that can be aligned with psychological attitudinal indicators: 1. **Perceived Value:** - How important is saving money on transportation to you on a scale of 1-5? - To what extent do you agree that carpooling provides a better value compared to riding alone? 2. **Social Influence:** - How likely are you to try a new transportation mode if it is recommended by friends or family? - Do you agree that people who carpool set a positive example for others? 3. **Perceived Convenience:** - On a scale from very inconvenient to very convenient, how would you rate the process of arranging a carpool in Dhaka? - Would you prefer a carpool option if it potentially decreased your travel time during peak hours? 4. **Environmental Concern:** - How concerned are you about the environmental impact of your transportation choices? - To what extent do you believe that carpooling can reduce pollution and traffic congestion in Dhaka? 5. **Safety and Comfort:** - Rate your concerns about safety when sharing rides with strangers. - How willing would you be to share a ride with others if it was guaranteed to be as comfortable as riding alone? 6. **Behavioral Intention:** - How likely are you to use a pooling option for your daily commute if it saved you 20% on your travel costs? - Assuming the pooling service meets your expectations, how often would you use it? For designing a survey and finding appropriate questions, you can consult various sources. Here are a few that might help you: 1. **Academic Literature:** Look for studies on transportation psychology, ridesharing behavior, and consumer behavior in travel. Google Scholar is an excellent resource for finding academic papers that might contain survey questions. 2. **Government and Transportation Agencies:** Organizations like the Department of Transportation or equivalent in different countries may have research or reports on commuter attitudes and behaviors. 3. **Survey Tools and Libraries:** Online survey platforms like Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, or LimeSurvey often have libraries of pre-validated questions that you can use as a starting point or for inspiration. 4. **Professional Networks:** Reach out to professionals or academics who specialize in transportation, urban planning, or environmental psychology. They could provide insights or share their survey tools. 5. **Market Research Reports:** Companies that specialize in market research such as Nielsen, Ipsos, or Pew Research may have published studies on consumer attitudes toward ridesharing that you could use for reference. Please remember that when developing your survey, you'll need to ensure that the questions are clear, unbiased, and as specific as possible to get reliable data.

However, with only the number of samples (n = 120) and the frequency of a particular outcome (40 samples), the p-value cannot be directly calculated. The context of a hypothesis test and the calculated test statistic are needed. If you provide more details on the hypothesis test and the resulting test statistic, I could help you determine the p-value."},{"instruction":"Suppose X1, ...,Xn are independent samples (each of size 100) from a population with mean M=18 and variance o2= 4.

To find the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample mean, we use the formula for the standard error of the mean (SEM), which is the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n). Given population variance σ² = 4, we first find the standard deviation: σ = √σ² = √4 = 2. The sample size (each X_i) is 100, so the standard error of the mean is: SEM = σ / √n = 2 / √100 = 2 / 10 = 0.2. Thus, the correct answer is: Option (a) mean = 18 and standard deviation = 0.2."},{"instruction":"answer direct and straight to the answer, no explaination needed: Select the missing key words for every sentence.

C++ is considered an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called \\"C with Classes\\" as it was an extension of the C language with the addition of classes in C++. However, later it was renamed C++ in 1983. C++ is known for its efficient performance and is widely used in software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications like desktop applications, servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases), performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or space probes), and entertainment software such as video games. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, and generic. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible. Some core features of C++ include: 1. Encapsulation 2. Data hiding 3. Inheritance 4. Polymorphism 5. Dynamic memory allocation Common uses of C++: - Game Development - Real-time systems - Operating system development - High-performance applications - Embedded systems - Simulation and modeling C++ has influenced many other programming languages such as C# and Java. There are also variants of C that have been directly influenced by C++, such as Objective-C. To write a simple \\"Hello, World!\\" program in C++, you would do the following: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << \\"Hello, World!\\" << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` In this program: - \`#include <iostream>\` is a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include the standard input-output stream library from the C++ Standard Library. - \`int main()\` is the main function where the execution of any C++ program begins. - \`std::cout\` is the output stream object used to send the data to the console. - \`\\"Hello, World!\\"\` is the message to be printed. - \`std::endl\` is an output stream manipulator that inserts a newline character and flushes the stream. - \`return 0;\` ends the main function and returns the value 0 to the calling process (usually the operating system).
