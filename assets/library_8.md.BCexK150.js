After Debbie seduces Uncle Fester, Wednesday becomes suspicious. To get rid of her, Debbie tricks Gomez and Morticia into believing Wednesday and her brother Pugsley want to go to summer camp. They are sent to Camp Chippewa, run by the overzealous Gary and Becky Granger, where they are singled out for their macabre dress and behavior. Joel, a nerdy bookworm who also does not fit in, becomes interested in Wednesday. Debbie and Fester become engaged. At their bachelor and bachelorette parties, Debbie is horrified by the Addams family. On their honeymoon, she tries to kill Fester by throwing a radio in the bathtub, but he survives. Frustrated by his resilience, Debbie forces him to sever ties with his family; when they try to visit Fester at Debbie's mansion, they are removed from the premises. At home, the Addams find to their alarm that Pubert has transformed into a rosy-cheeked, golden-haired baby. Grandmama diagnoses this as a result of his disrupted family life, and Gomez becomes depressed. At camp, Wednesday is cast as Pocahontas in Gary's saccharine Thanksgiving play. When she refuses to participate, she, Pugsley and Joel are forced to watch upbeat Disney and family films. Afterwards, Wednesday feigns cheerfulness and agrees to the play.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"From the early 13th century, the dominant sacred musical form had been the motet; a composition with text in several parts.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What was the dominant sacred musical form in the early 13th century?\\" Select from: A). yes; B). no;","output":"A). Yes The sentence explicitly states that \\"From the early 13th century, the dominant sacred musical form had been the motet.\\" This clearly answers the question \\"What was the dominant sacred musical form in the early 13th century?\\" by identifying the motet as the primary musical form of that time period. The motet, in historical context, is a key component of early music, specifically within the realm of sacred sounds. Originating from the Medieval period, where voices and instruments were combined to create harmonies, motets were the predominant form of composition, especially in the realm of ecclesiastical or sacred music. In the 13th century, motets were essentially polytextual, meaning they contained more than one text sung simultaneously, often in Latin, with each voice in a different vernacular language. Frequently, these compositions were religious in nature, and would often featured multiple, contrasting musical themes or melodies.  Therefore, when the sentence defines the motet as the \\"composition with text in several parts,\\" it is referring to this historical period where motets were the primary form of sacred music and were marked by their polytextual structure.  Thus, the sentence not only provides a valid answer to the question posed, but it does so with an ample level of detail about the characteristics of the motet as a dominant sacred musical form during the early 13th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \\"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...\\" Lennon said: \\"We used to dress how we...

Compare the key phrases:     a. \\"beta - acute dose effects of dependent radiation\\"    b. \\"acute dose-dependent effects of beta radiation\\" 2. Analyze the structure and meaning of each phrase:    a. In the first phrase (a), \\"beta\\" and \\"acute dose\\" are adjectives modifying \\"effects.\\" \\"Dependent radiation\\" likely refers to \\"radiation that is dependent on something.\\" However, this phrase is somewhat unclear and could be misinterpreted.        b. In the second phrase (b), \\"acute dose-dependent\\" is the adjective modifying \\"effects.\\" This clearly indicates that the effects are caused by an acute (short-term or sudden) dose of radiation and that they are dependent on the dose. \\"Beta radiation\\" specifies the type of radiation causing the effects. 3. Compare the clarity and coherence of each phrase:     a. The first phrase (a) is somewhat ambiguous because it is not clear which term \\"dependent\\" is modifying.        b. The second phrase (b) is much clearer, as the the term \\"dose-dependent\\" is clearly modifying \\"effects\\" and the overall structure is more coherent.

Although it is an accurate description of the economic situation during that time, it gives no information about the prevalence and nature of diseases during that period. Instead, an appropriate answer would address the health conditions and diseases that were common or exacerbated due to the Great Depression. For example, the Great Depression led to increases in malnutrition, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression as a result of high unemployment, poverty, and a lack of access to quality healthcare. Illnesses related to malnutrition, like pellagra and rickets, also became more widespread due to limited food sources and a lack of knowledge about proper nutrition. Poverty and overcrowding in urban areas made it easier for infectious diseases to spread, and a lack of resources and inadequate funding for public health programs made it difficult for health officials to address these concerns. Moreover, since people were struggling to meet basic needs, preventative healthcare and timely medical treatment were often neglected, thereby worsening health outcomes. In conclusion, the suggested statement does not provide a suitable answer to the question about diseases during the Great Depression. Instead, an appropriate response would detail the various health issues faced by individuals during that time, such as malnutrition, infectious diseases, and mental health problems, as well as the broader societal factors that contributed to these conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A state house staffer who left his loaded handgun in the men's bathroom at the Capitol building is facing calls for his resignation. Dave Evans, a legislative assistant. to Republican House Speaker Tim Jones, left the loaded 9mm pistol on top of a. toilet paper dispenser in a men’s bathroom in the Missouri State Capitol. last Friday. Another House staffer found the gun and reported it to police. A gun safety group today called for Evans to be fired after he left the gun in the basement bathroom in Jefferson City, Missouri. Danger: Dave Evans (left), a legislative assistant to House Speaker Tim Jones (pictured right), left a loaded handgun in a bathroom at the State Capitol building in Missouri on Friday. A gun safety group is calling for a Missouri House staffer to be fired after he left a loaded handgun unattended in a Capitol bathroom in Jefferson Ci. Rebecca Morgan, spokeswoman for the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said: 'Any child could’ve found that gun, or someone could’ve found it and resold it.' According to the police report, Evans has a concealed-carry permit. Police returned the gun to him, and no charges were filed. A 2011 law allows legislative staff with concealed-carry permits to bring firearms into the Capitol. Tom Smith, Jones’ chief of staff, said in a statement on Tuesday that Evans will take a gun safety course in the next few weeks as a result of the incident. 'He is extremely remorseful about this unfortunate incident and willing to take full accountability for his mistake,' Mr Smith said. Ms Morgan said the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action has asked Jones to issue an apology and to fire Evans. The. organization is also calling schools and asking them to cancel their. planned field trips to the Capitol, which houses the Missouri State. Museum. Dave Evans, left a Kahr CM9 9 mm gun, in a public bathroom stall at the Capitol building in Missouri (stock image) The museum received more than 470,000 visitors last year, according to its website. Of those, 30,000 were children on guided tours, according to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Morgan said that just as mothers call their children’s friends’ houses before play dates to make sure all firearms are secured, parents and schools should be aware of safety risks within the Capitol building. 'My son is supposed to go later in the school year, and I don’t feel safe sending him to the Capitol,' she said. The Moms Demand Action group hopes its effort will help change the 2011 concealed-carry law. 'If (Evans) can have his fully loaded, ready-to-shoot, unattended gun in a restroom and there’s no law against it, the law needs to change,' Morgan said. She said the organization received no direct response from the Capitol. Moms Demand Action describes itself as a grassroots organization that formed nationwide after the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. 'It’s just a crying shame,' Morgan said of the unattended gun. 'It’s our responsibility as parents and as legislators to make sure that it doesn’t take losing a child’s life to change this law.'

Use sandpaper, steel wool, or anything else abrasive to clean away any grime or dirt from any areas of your pipes and fittings that need to be soldered. This will let your solder hold more tightly to the pipe and result in a more sturdy connection.  You should only need to clean around 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of the piping to give you room to solder easily. If you're using a larger pipe fitting, you may need to clean more to ensure the point of overlap between the pipe and the fitting is prepared for soldering. Use 120-grit sandpaper or grade 1 steel wool for cleaning your pipe fittings. This should be enough to strip away dirt and grime without damaging the pipes themselves.  If you plan on cutting and soldering a lot of pipes, you might benefit from a specialised pipe cleaner. This will let you more easily scrub away any impurities on the inside and outside of your pipes. Ask at your local hardware store or look online to find one that suits your needs. Use a small paintbrush to cover the ends of your pipes and the insides of your pipe fittings with a thin layer of flux. Look around the edges of the pipe for any large lumps of flux and brush them away. Any type of flux that you have will work when soldering pipes together. Acid flux will be more corrosive, but may damage pipes that are too fragile. Tinning flux will help hold your pipes together more strongly, but may be more difficult to find or more expensive. If you're unsure, ask at your local hardware store for advice on the best type of flux to use for the job you're working on. Hold the two sections you need to connect together in each hand, keeping them off of your work surface to prevent any flux from rubbing off. Push the two ends together securely until they are fully connected. Wipe away any flux that comes off with a clean paintbrush. You should connect a section of a few pipes together before you begin to solder them. Working one at a time may be very slow, and trying to deal with a long section all at once may be very difficult! Work with a few pieces at a time. Heat will make the metal expand, so you should always heat the larger sections of your pipes up before the smaller sections. Hold a soldering iron to the pipe, or use a blowtorch to heat the metal up until the soldering flux melts into the joint and begins to bubble slightly. When the flux is just starting to bubble and the pipe is hot, press the tip of the solder to the opposite side as you are holding the blowtorch. The solder should melt immediately and work into the joint to hold it together. Pull the torch away and quickly run the solder around the circumference of the joint to completely seal it.  You should only need to use around 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) of the solder to completely seal the pipe. If the solder doesn't run into the joint and forms small beads that roll away from it instead, you might have burnt the flux or may not have cleaned the pipe properly. Wait until the pipes are cooled, disconnect them and start again. It's easier to reach around the back side of the pipe if you bend a small hook in the solder wire before you begin soldering. Grip the solder far enough away from the tip that you won't risk melted solder getting on your hands. For extra safety, wear fire-resistant gloves as you work. Once the pipes have cooled a little, look around the edges of the joints to make sure they are evenly coated with solder. If you notice any sections without solder, apply a small amount of flux on the area and let it melt with the residual heat of the pipes. Use the blowtorch to heat the pipe up again and apply a small amount of solder to the bare area. It may take a while to get a good feel for when pipes are completely soldered. As a general rule of thumb, as long as there is a thin, silvery trim around the edges of your fittings, the pipe should be fully soldered.","output":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on preparing, connecting, and soldering pipes using sandpaper or steel wool for cleaning, choosing the right type of flux, connecting sections together, and properly applying heat and solder to ensure sturdy and sealed pipe connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I can use this background: What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.  Now, I have a new situation: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs.  Answer this question please: Which chair has a lower air pressure? The answer to this question is:","output":"To determine which chair has a lower air pressure, we need to consider the effect of the boys' weights on the inflatable chairs and apply Boyle's law. Here's a step-by-step analysis: 1. The two inflatable chairs are identical, meaning they have the same initial volume and air pressure before the boys sit on them. 2. Boyle's law states that if the temperature is constant, decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure, and vice versa. 3. When Patrick and Mark sit on the chairs, their weights apply a force on the chairs, causing them to compress, which affects the volume of the air inside the chairs. 4. Since Mark weighs more than Patrick, the force he applies to the chair is greater, causing the volume of air inside the green chair to decrease even more. 5. As the volume of air inside the green chair decreases more than in the red chair, the pressure inside the green chair increases (according to Boyle's law). Based on the analysis, the red chair, the one Patrick is sitting on, has a lower air pressure as compared to the green chair on which Mark is sitting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Albanians first appear in the historical record in Byzantine sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.  After reading the above, is \\"Communist\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What Regime took control of Albania after WWII and prior to 1992?\\"?","output":"Yes, according to the text, the Communist regime took control of Albania after World War II and prior to 1992. The text specifically states: \\"The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state.\\" The mentioned timing (after World War II and before 1992) also aligns with the significant period in history when Communist regimes were in charge in many Eastern European countries, further corroborating this claim. Moreover, the time frame until 1992 is indicated by the statement \\"Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992,\\" confirming that a new regime started post-1992. Therefore, the text supports the statement that the Communist regime controlled Albania between World War II and 1992."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The first spectators, many carrying chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline.  At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued.

Exercise not only helps you lose weight, but also improves muscle strength, flexibility, and bone density. Furthermore, it can help in stress management and improve mental well-being. 4. Sweat: Sweating is an essential process for our body, as it plays a vital role in regulating body temperature, especially during exercise. Through sweating, our bodies can release toxins and maintain a healthy balance, ensuring overall good health. 5. Feel better: Regular exercise positively impacts emotional well-being and mental health. As mentioned earlier, physical activity releases endorphins, which naturally elevate mood and help relieve stress, anxiety, and depression.  In summary, getting in shape is essential for maintaining good health, well-being, and a better quality of life. By participating in activities such as jogging and other exercises, you'll sweat more, promoting the release of toxins, and ultimately feel better both physically and mentally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp's producer Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, \\"Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice.\\" The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and reached number...

Q: Passage: Another common myth is that none of the survivors of the Willie or Martin handcart companies ever complained and they never apostatized from the church.  The most popular source came from William Palmer, who paraphrased a comment Francis Webster had made in a Sunday School class in Cedar City. He writes: ... did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the church because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities. This was later quoted by David O. McKay in 1948, and later by Gordon B. Hinckley, James E. Faust and was taught to children.  However, several people in the Willie or Martin handcart companies did leave the church, including John Chislett, John Ahmanson, Elizabeth Sermon, Henry Augustus Squires, Henry Kemp and Deborah Jane Chapman. Many of the survivors complained.Palmer gave the quote during a radio series of Men You Should Know describing the life of Webster about forty years after Webster died. Palmer said that he was paraphrasing Webster, and given the lapse of time and the casual nature of a Sunday School class, Orton believes it unlikely to be an exact quote. Orton believes Palmer was trying to emphasize Webster's character, rather than give a definitive statement on the faithfulness of all the members of the Willie Martin handcart company, and finds it unlikely that it was an exact quote. Orton also finds it unlikely that Webster knew all of the survivors, given that they spread throughout Utah after they arrived and didn't have a reunion until after Webster's death. Orton believes Webster was only referring to the pioneers in Cedar City, where the quote was given.  Question: What is the first name of the person who gave a quote during a radio series of Men You Should Know?

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Can be categorized into several types: These include \\"preppers\\" who stockpile essentials, \\"survivalists\\" who acquire skills for self-sufficiency, \\"sovereign citizens\\" who reject certain laws and taxes, and militiamen who undergo military-style training to resist perceived government threats. 3. Originated in the early 1990s: The Southern Poverty Law Center traces the origins of the modern militia movement back to incidents such as Bill Clinton's election and the FBI raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. 4. Saw their membership rise during Democratic presidencies: The context mentions that membership in these groups grew under Bill Clinton, and it implies that growth might have slowed with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support. 5. Are concerned about losing their constitutional rights: Anti-government groups often view the government as a threat to their fundamental rights, such as the right to bear arms. 6.

Following the British capture of Ticonderoga, it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell.  Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance.  George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\".  Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses.  On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga.  Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew.  Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way.  The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished.  At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort.  The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site.  The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began.

Does \\"Though argued from scripture, and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura, this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers.\\" correctly answer the question of What was Luther's main principle?","output":"While the statement does provide some insight into the main principle driving Martin Luther and the later reformers, it is not a complete answer. To provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, we should delve deeper into the historical context, the core beliefs of the Reformation, and the primary motivations of its key figures. Martin Luther, a German theologian and monk, initiated the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century. His primary objective was to challenge and reform the practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, which he believed had long deviated from the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. Luther's main principle can be better encapsulated in the concepts of \\"Sola Scriptura,\\" \\"Sola Fide,\\" \\"Sola Gratia,\\" and \\"The Priesthood of all Believers.\\" 1. Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone): Luther asserted that the Bible alone should be the ultimate authority on Christian beliefs, practices, and faith. This principle stands in contrast to the Catholic tradition, where authority was derived not only from the Scriptures but also from Church hierarchy, tradition, and the Pope's authority. By emphasizing sola scriptura, Luther aimed to refocus Christian faith on its original source — the Word of God. 2. Sola Fide (Faith Alone): Luther was particularly troubled by the prevalent practice of indulgences in the Catholic Church, a system in which people could essentially buy their way into heaven by purchasing pardons for sins or by aiding the construction of churches. Luther believed that salvation was not obtained through good deeds, the purchase of indulgences, or participation in Church rituals. Instead, it was obtained solely through faith in Jesus Christ and his sacrificial atonement for humanity's sins. This principle of sola fide was fundamentally based on the teachings found in the New Testament. 3. Sola Gratia (Grace Alone): This principle emphasizes that God's grace, rather than human efforts or merits, is the ultimate source of salvation. Luther argued that although human beings are inherently sinful and undeserving, God, through his kindness and generosity, offers the free gift of salvation by grace alone. This belief was a direct challenge to the Catholic Church's stance on the role of good works, sacraments, and penance in achieving salvation. 4. The Priesthood of all Believers: Luther believed that each individual believer should have direct access to God without the need for ecclesiastical mediators, such as priests. This was a radical departure from the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church, where the clergy was set apart as a privileged group with unique access to divine grace. By embracing the priesthood of all believers, Luther advocated for a personal relationship with God, with each believer actively engaging in the study of the Scriptures and serving as a minister to others. In conclusion, Martin Luther's main principle transcends the single statement provided. It can more accurately be described as a combination of principles – Sola Scriptura, Sola Fide, Sola Gratia, and The Priesthood of all Believers – which aimed to challenge corruption, restore the authority of the Bible, and emphasize the importance of faith and grace in achieving salvation. These principles became the foundation for the teachings of Luther and the later reformers, eventually giving rise to the various Protestant denominations we know today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Philadelphia took flight in the first quarter with wide receiver DeSean Jackson's 67-yard touchdown run and linebacker Will Witherspoon (recently acquired from the Rams) returning an interception 9 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the Eagles increased their lead with a 47-yard field goal from kicker David Akers.  The Redskins would get on the board with quarterback Jason Campbell completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Devin Thomas, yet Philadelphia answered with Akers nailing a 44-yard field goal and quarterback Donovan McNabb completing a 57-yard touchdown pass to Jackson.  Washington would close out the half with a 47-yard field goal from kicker Shaun Suisham. In the third quarter, both defenses fought back and forth and the period ended with no points.

Write an article based on this \\"Northern Ireland construction workers are calling for political intervention to solve a cross-border problem involving health and safety training.\\"","output":"Title: Health and Safety Training Crisis in Northern Ireland's Construction Sector: The Need for Political Intervention Introduction: Northern Ireland's construction industry is currently grappling with a major issue surrounding health and safety training for its workers. In the recent times, there have been increased calls for political intervention to tackle this cross-border problem promptly. Construction workers in the region have cited concerns over inconsistencies in standards, skills recognition, and enforcement. This article aims to shed light on the current situation, the implications of this issue, and the possible solutions to address the problem. Background: The construction industry in Northern Ireland – and the United Kingdom at large – is subject to stringent health and safety regulations. These regulations are designed to ensure workers' safety and minimize accidents on construction sites. In line with this, construction workers are required to undergo health and safety training courses periodically. However, recent issues have emerged regarding the recognition and validity of these training courses, especially in the context of Northern Ireland's shared border with the Republic of Ireland. The Problem: The primary concern for Northern Irish construction workers is that health and safety training courses completed in the Republic of Ireland are often not recognized by construction companies and regulators in Northern Ireland. This essentially means that workers who have completed the necessary training and hold valid certification are being denied the opportunity to work on construction projects on Northern Ireland soil. Conversely, Northern Irish workers may need to retake courses to validate their qualifications once in the Republic of Ireland. Employers and regulators argue that differences in health and safety training standards and enforcement mechanisms make it difficult to ascertain the credibility and equivalence of qualifications obtained across the border. This situation creates confusion and frustration for construction workers, leading to potential exploitation in the workforce and hindering the construction sector from reaping the full benefits of cross-border cooperation. The Need for Political Intervention: Addressing this problem requires not only collaboration within the construction industry but also intervention by political representatives. Politicians have the power to influence standards and regulations to ensure better alignment of health and safety requirements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They can promote dialogues between certification bodies, regulators, and construction companies in both jurisdictions to identify areas of commonality and establish mutual recognition of skills and qualifications. Furthermore, politicians can scrutinize and amend existing legislative frameworks to better safeguard the needs of construction workers. This process might entail the introduction of legal provisions that compel construction companies to recognize the validity of health and safety training courses from both regions. Political intervention can drive transparency and consistency, leading to a fairer system and facilitating labor mobility in the sector. Conclusion: The cross-border health and safety training crisis in Northern Ireland's construction sector represents a significant barrier to growth, skill development, and worker protection. Addressing the issue necessitates concerted efforts by multiple stakeholders, particularly political representatives, to align standards and regulations across the region. Ultimately, through effective collaboration and political intervention in this matter, the construction sector can strive towards a more unified cross-border environment that promotes worker safety and enhances opportunities for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out.

He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert...  Guess a valid title for it!

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"when is fog common?\\" with the following options:  - summer end  - before thunderstorms  - The area was once underwater  - dry and hot  - It used to be covered by water  - never  - outer space  - under water Answer:","output":"Fog is common before thunderstorms. This can be inferred from the given facts, which state that cold fronts cause thunderstorms as they pass by, and fog is common in the cold air ahead of the front. When a cold front approaches, it displaces warm air, causing the temperature and humidity levels to change. The cooler air near the ground mixes with the warmer, moisture-laden air above it, leading to the formation of fog. Fog is a natural meteorological phenomenon that occurs when water droplets or ice crystals are suspended in the air just above the Earth's surface, causing a reduction in visibility. It is often observed in areas where there are sudden temperature changes, like the transition from land to water or different air masses meeting. Therefore, it is common before thunderstorms when a cold front is moving in, and the environmental conditions are suitable for fog formation. In the context of the provided options: - Summer end: Fog can occur at any time of the year. However, it might be less common at the end of summer as warmer weather patterns would not cool the air as quickly, leading to less likelihood of fog forming before a thunderstorm. - The area was once underwater / It used to be covered by water: While these options might seem relevant because fog is created by the presence of water droplets, they focus more on the geological history of an area than on the meteorological conditions necessary for fog formation. - Dry and hot: Fog is less likely to form under dry and hot conditions, as the warm air would evaporate the moisture required for fog formation. - Never: This option is incorrect, as fog is a common meteorological phenomenon and can occur under specific environmental conditions, such as before thunderstorms. - Outer space: Fog cannot form in outer space due to the lack of atmosphere, air, and moisture needed for fog to form. - Underwater: Fog does not occur underwater. However, the underwater equivalent of fog does exist, known as turbidity, which is the decrease in visibility caused by the presence of suspended particles in the water. In conclusion, given the provided options and the meteorological facts presented, fog is common before thunderstorms when cold fronts approach and create the necessary environmental conditions for fog to form."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Being pictured with friends could boost your perceived attractiveness as people tend to 'average out' everyone's facial features when looking at group photos. Observers perceive each individual's face as more average than they would otherwise - and average faces are deemed more attractive. The phenomenon is dubbed the 'cheerleader effect'. Tulisa shows her support to Little Mix by attending their gig at G-A-Y earlier this month 'Average faces are more attractive, likely due to the averaging out of unattractive idiosyncrasies,' says","output":"Dr. Drew Walker, a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego, who led the study. The research involved several experiments in which participants rated the attractiveness of people in photographs - both in group settings and as individuals. Consistently, participants found the individuals to be more attractive when they were part of a group. In light of these findings, people may start to rethink their social media strategies - perhaps prioritizing group photos over selfies to improve their online attractiveness. Dr. Walker suggests that being seen in a group setting, whether it's online or in person, could have practical benefits when it comes to dating, networking, or even job hunting. While it might seem counterintuitive to make one's own face less distinctive in order to appear more attractive, the cheerleader effect proves that sometimes, blending in works to our advantage. The effect reveals the power of context in shaping our perceptions of attractiveness and provides a simple strategy for those looking to put their best face forward. And so, the story comes to an enlightening end, as the cheerleader effect gains popularity not just among scientists but in the wider public as well. As more people become aware of the phenomenon, they begin incorporating it into their lives - helping everyone present their most appealing selves to the world."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The missing word is the one we'll need to fill in using one of the multiple choice options. Part #2: Understand the context of the sentence Usage: After identifying the sentence and the missing word, we must understand what the sentence is saying - to understand the context and the topic of the sentence. The sentence \\"Coating is non-reactive and lasts at least ____ times as long as filament sources.\\" talks about the lasting time or durability of a non-reactive coating in comparison to 'filament sources'. Hence, we need a word that would make sense within this specific context. Part #3: Look at each answer option Usage: The options given are a) ten, b) eight, c) one, d) zero. We need to assess each option and decide which one correctly fills the blank. In this case, we are talking about something that is longer than another. So logically, it can't be 'zero' and since it's being compared as longer than the filament sources it can't be 'one'. So it's either 'ten' or 'eight'.  Part #4: Choose the best option that fills the blank Usage: Determining the 'best' answer requires judgement and depends on the specific context of the sentence. Here, without any further information either 'ten' or 'eight' could fit but 'ten' is more likely to be used in this kind of comparison so the answer would be a) ten. This is the best choice because this number is often used in comparative phrases like 'ten times more', 'ten times as much', etc., which suggests that the coating lasts significantly longer than the filament sources.  Part #5: Indicate the answer with its index Usage: Indicate the answer with its index as per the instruction given. Here, the index of the chosen answer 'ten' is 'a'.

Read this and answer the question The quail is a small to medium-sized, cryptically coloured bird. In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long before the arrival of chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan.

Q: What resource is considered nonrewable for human purposes, because it takes so long to form and is depleted by farming and other activities?   A: Answer:","output":"Soil is considered a nonrenewable resource for human purposes due to the significant amount of time it takes to form and its depletion by various human activities, such as farming, deforestation, and urbanization.  Soil formation is a slow process that occurs over thousands of years through the weathering of rocks, the decomposition of organic materials, and the activity of microorganisms. Due to the lengthy timescale involved in soil formation, it can be considered nonrenewable when subjected to unsustainable agricultural practices, deforestation, and other detrimental human activities. The overuse of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and the monoculture approach to farming can result in soil degradation and eventually lead to soil depletion, losing its essential nutrients and organic content. Excessive tillage and poor management practices can also lead to soil erosion, further depleting the soil's productivity. Additionally, deforestation and urbanization for infrastructure development eliminate natural vegetation, disrupting soil structure and contributing to the loss of valuable topsoil. To protect this critical nonrenewable resource, it's essential to adopt sustainable agriculture and land use practices, ensuring that soil health and fertility are preserved for future generations."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Bethesda Game Studios is an American video game developer, acting as in-house development team for parent company Bethesda Softworks, established in 2001. Previously synonymous with parent publisher Bethesda Softworks, the studio's name and logo were established with the release of \\"\\" in 2002.

A second studio, Bethesda Game Studios Montreal, was opened in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  - Bethesda Softworks LLC is an American video game publisher based in Rockville, Maryland. The company was founded by Christopher Weaver in 1986 in Bethesda, Maryland as a division of Media Technology Limited, and nowadays is a wholly owned subsidiary of ZeniMax Media. Originally a video game developer itself, Bethesda Softworks now acts as the publisher for their in-house development team, Bethesda Game Studios, and ZeniMax Media's subsidiaries, ZeniMax Online Studios, id Software, Arkane Studios, MachineGames, Tango Gameworks and BattleCry Studios.  - An expansion pack, expansion set, supplement, or simply expansion is an addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game or video game. These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties). Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the \\"Dragon Slayer\\" games \\"\\" and \\"Sorcerian\\".  - Downloadable content (DLC) is additional content created for a released video game. It is distributed through the Internet by the game's official publisher. Downloadable content can be of several types, ranging from aesthetic outfit changes to a new, extensive storyline, similar to an expansion pack. As such, DLC may add new game modes, objects, levels, challenges or other features to a complete, already released game.  - Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is a role-playing open world video game developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay in September 1998.

The game is set within a post-apocalyptic, open world environment that encompasses a region consisting of the ruins of Washington, D.C. and much of the countryside to the west of it, referred to as the \\"Capital Wasteland\\". It takes place within \\"Fallout\\" usual setting of a world that deviated into an alternate timeline thanks to atomic age technology, which eventually led to its devastation by a nuclear apocalypse in the year 2077 (referred to as \\"The Great War\\"), caused by a major international conflict between the United States and China over natural resources and the last remaining supplies of untapped petroleum.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Lord Bichard, a former benefits chief, said \\"imaginative\\" ideas were needed to meet the cost of an ageing society. And although such a move might be controversial, it would stop older people being a \\"burden on the state\\". The peer is a member of a committee investigating demographic changes and their impact on public services. The panel was told that the transfer of wealth from young to old in the UK was the highest in Europe. Lord Bichard, a former head of the Benefits Agency and top civil servant at the Education Department, who is probably best known for chairing the 2004 inquiry into the Soham murders, said the debate on rising healthcare and pension costs needed to be broadened out. \\"Are there ways in which we could use incentives to encourage older people, if not to be in full time work, to be making a contribution?,\\" he asked the rest of the committee. \\"It is quite possible, for example, to envisage a world where civil society is making a greater contribution to the care of the very old, and older people who are not very old could be making a useful contribution to civil society in that respect, if they were given some incentive or some recognition for doing so.\\" The 65-year-old crossbench peer, who has taken on a number of roles including the vice presidency of the Local Government Association and the chairmanship of a national after-school film club since retiring from the civil service in 2001, suggested the government should use the pensions system to \\"incentivise\\" retired people. \\"We are now prepared to say to people who are not looking for work, if you don't look for work you don't get benefits, so if you are old and you are not contributing in some way or another maybe there is some penalty attached to that.\\" He asked: \\"Are we using all of the incentives at our disposal to encourage older people not just to be a negative burden on the state but actually be a positive part of society?\\" Prof Martin Weale, a member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, said the proposal was \\"outside the normal range of what is discussed\\", but added it was an \\"interesting point\\". Asked about his suggestion after the meeting, Lord Bichard said it was a new idea but he intended to look into it further as part of his work for the committee. He acknowledged it would be difficult for politicians to sell to the public, but added: \\"So was tuition fees.\\" Pensioners' rights campaigners reacted angrily to Lord Bichard's idea. Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said: \\"This amounts to little more than national service for the over 60s and is absolutely outrageous. \\"Those who have paid their national insurance contributions for 30 or more years are entitled to receive their state pension and there should be no attempt to put further barriers in their way.\\" Michelle Mitchell, director general of the charity Age UK, said: \\"Older people are a hugely positive part of society - over a third of people aged between 65 and 74 volunteer, a percentage that only drops slightly for the over 75s. \\"In addition, nearly a million older people provide unpaid care to family or friends saving the state millions of pounds.\\" She added that almost a third of working age parents rely on grandparents to provide childcare - and more than 900,000 people are working past the traditional retirement age \\"either because they want to or because they can't afford to retire\\". But she added: \\"We must not forget that retirement is a vastly different experience depending on your personal circumstances. For example, 40% of all people over 65 have a serious longstanding illness and 1.7m of our pensioners live in poverty. \\"For many of those, retirement can be an unrelenting struggle of trying to survive on a low income in poor health.\\" Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, said: \\"This is a very strange idea indeed. Those who have retired have already made huge contributions to our society and are already the largest group of charity and community volunteers.\\" Prof James Sefton, of Imperial College, London, a former adviser to the Treasury, told the committee young people were effectively subsidising the older generation - and he could not understand why they were not protesting about it. \\"I think they should be angry. I think the deal they are getting is poor,\\" he told the peers. \\"There are a lot of transfers going on within the system, from the young towards the old and I think awareness of it is very poor and I think eventually it will come out.\\" He said research he was carrying out at Imperial College, with Dr David McCarthy, suggested \\"the current generation are very heavy contributors to the public purse, whereas previous generations have benefited from the public purse\\". This was mostly down to high house prices, high youth unemployment, rising public debt and the cost of education, added Prof Sefton, who is also a quantitative analyst at UBS bank. The older generation benefits from public funds, in the form of healthcare and pensions, but younger people have to rely more on \\"private transfers\\" of wealth, such as family money, to a far greater extent than in other European countries, he added. Update 26 October 2012: Lord Bichard has asked us to clarify that he was floating an idea at the committee rather than making a firm proposal. This report has been slightly amended to take account of that. What is a summary of this text?","output":"Lord Bichard, a former benefits chief, suggested an idea that retired people might need to do some work to receive their pensions. This idea is to help the cost of an ageing society. It might be controversial, but it would prevent older people from relying too much on the state for help.

Does it follow that \\"A brown, calf-bound book could be found on the little table.\\"?","output":"Yes, it follows that \\"A brown, calf-bound book could be found on the little table.\\" Based on the given information, we can infer that the book was located somewhere around the boots. When Drew unstrapped the old pair of boots and fitted the new ones, the book fell to the floor. This event indicates that the book was placed at a nearby location, which could be the little table mentioned in your question. Furthermore, let me provide some additional context around this situation: Given the circumstances, it is likely that the brown, calf-bound book was resting on the little table due to its close proximity to the boots. This assumption is substantiated by the fact that the book fell to the floor when Drew interacted with the boots. The placement of the book on the table would have provided easy access for Drew, or anyone else who might require the information or content contained within. Additionally, the book's calf-bound nature suggests that it could be of some importance or valuable in some way. Calf-bound books are generally known for their durability and quality, often being associated with higher-end or luxury editions. Therefore, placing it on a table would imply that it was being showcased or readily available for reference or use, further supporting the idea that the book could be found on the little table. In conclusion, based on the information and observations provided, it is reasonable to conclude that \\"A brown, calf-bound book could be found on the little table.\\" As Drew interacted with the boots, causing the book to fall, it is credible that the book was positioned somewhere close to the boots, and the little table seems like a fitting location for such a book."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Manchus were formerly known as the Jurchens. When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng's peasant rebels in 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor, the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Mancus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper. Schoppa, the editor of The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History argues, \\"A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'.

Staying at the Riviera was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Absolute nightmare.  My girlfriend and I had booked 3 nights at the Riviera 3 and half months before we stayed there. We selected a non-smoking luxury room with a king bed. I double checked the reservation before we left, and everything was good to go - we were excited! We checked into the hotel late in the evening and were given our room key along with some brochures. Tired from the drive, we couldn't wait to get to our room and crash. But upon finding our room we discovered that we had been placed in a smoking, classic room with two beds.   The room stank. Neither I nor my girlfriend are smokers, and though we had specifically booked a non-smoking room, we were forced to cohabitate amidst the saturated stench of a dirty ash tray. But the smell wasn't the only unpleasant thing about the room, not by a long shot. For starters, it was ugly as sin. There walls were stained, the bathroom cabinets were missing knobs, and the wallpaper was so hideous that it took every ounce of willpower I had not to gouge my eyes out.  I immediately called the front desk to get this sorted out, explaining that there was a mistake and we had not been placed in the room we ordered online. The front desk clerk told me that the hotel was completely booked and there were no available rooms to switch into. She suggested checking back in the morning around 11:00 a.m. to see if there had been any check outs.  11 a.m. rolls around and I am at the front desk checking to see if anything has opened up. Nothing. The clerk tells me there are still no available rooms, but to try back in a few hours. Fast forward and I'm back there again listening to them tell me that there are no rooms and there is nothing they can do. I ask to speak to the manager, and after about 15 minutes of waiting, he comes out of his office to speak with me. The clerks at least pretended like they wanted to help me and were doing everything they could, this guy had a pompous air about him that let me know I was wasting his time before he even said anything. I once again explained my situation, to which he smugly replied that the room choice option on their website was a preference and did not guarantee that the preferred room type would be reserved. Furthermore he told me that the hotel had enough guests to fill the luxury rooms, so he didn't feel inclined to switch us. Then, with the phoniest and most self-satisfied smile I had ever seen, he reiterated that there was nothing more he could do.   What kind of bullshit is that? I don't know about you, but when I book a room I assume that the room I booked will be reserved.  Feeling defeated, I retired to my room to tell my girlfriend what had happened. But it wasn't over.  Later that night, we were getting ready to go to sleep. I was laying on the bed watching TV and she was just stepping into the bathroom when suddenly she released a blood curdling shriek. She screamed so loud I was sure I was about to see a dead body laying there on the bathroom floor. What I saw was worse. Scurrying across the floor was the most enormous cockroach I have ever seen. This thing was HUGE I'm talking the size of a small mouse.   After completely losing our shit, my girlfriend and I regrouped to formulate a plan of attack. Our first instinct was to curb stomp the shit out of this vile creature, and send it back to the pits of hell from whence it came. But we resisted these urges in favor of a much more devious plan - bring it to the front desk.  I somehow managed to capture the disgusting hell-beast in a plastic cup, and skipped joyfully down to the lobby to speak with the manager. He emerged from his office looking complacent as ever, no doubt prepared to send me packing once again. \\"How can I help y--\\" he began to say as I placed the cup on the counter in front of him. Upon seeing this captured behemoth, his eyes went wide and the smugness left his face faster than you can say \\"la cucaracha.\\" He was utterly petrified, and I was loving every second. Fixated on the cup for a few moments, he looked up at me with a grimace and said \\"I don't like bugs.\\" And without missing a beat my girlfriend replied, \\"Neither do we.\\" The delivery of that line could have been straight out of a movie, almost too good to be unscripted.  To his credit, the manager ended up giving us a 40 compensation to eat at one of the hotel restaurants. It didn't make up for our experience but at least it was something. In addition, he MAGICALLY found a luxury room for us to stay in for our final night there. So on one hand that was nice, but also a glaring confirmation that those assholes lied to us about the hotel being completely booked. Overall, I would rate my experience at the Riviera as thoroughly horrendous and would NOT recommend anyone to go there. Ever. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","output":"This review can be described as having an overwhelmingly negative sentiment. The guest experienced a series of issues and inconveniences during their stay at the Riviera, including being given the wrong room, unhelpful staff and management, and encountering a large cockroach in the bathroom. The guest explicitly states that they had the worst hotel experience ever and strongly advises against others booking a stay at the Riviera. Although the manager eventually compensated the guest and provided the originally requested room, these actions did not redeem the overall negative experience."},{"instruction":"I can use this background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  Now, I have a new situation: Jake and Todd used different farming methods to produce their crops. Jake always tills his land, while Todd uses he no-tillage method.  Answer this question please: Which farmer had less residue from the prior year's crops?

He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada.

Napoleon Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.

The incident, which took place at 4 pm, saw the traditional cob cottage, built in a terraced style, collapse along with the scaffolding adjoining the structure. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and the house was empty at the time of the event. The collapse occurred near the town centre, resulting in debris falling into the street, which temporarily disrupted local traffic. This collapse of a tradiational cob-built cottage marks the second such occurrence in Devon within a week. On 4 September, a 400-year-old cob cottage in nearby East Budleigh faced a similar fate. The owner's father, John Timms, and two builders were fortunate enough to escape without injury, having fled just in the nick of time as they heard the cob structure cracking. Recounting the experience, Timms explained, \\"'I heard cracking noises, which became louder, so I got out.\\" The three witnesses watched from a safe distance as the historic property succumbed to the collapse. The incidents have raised concerns around the preservation and maintenance of heritage buildings in the region, especially given that cob construction is revered as a functional, sustainable, and fireproof building material. Cob is a traditional house-building technique commonly used in Devon, which utilises a mix of clay, earth, and straw to create sturdy, durable structures. Dawlish and East Budleigh are not the only places in Devon that showcase this ancient construction technique. Many more historic cob-built cottages still stand proudly across the county, representing architectural gems rich in cultural significance. These recent collapses may serve as a wake-up call for property owners and local authorities to take appropriate measures in ensuring these heritage buildings are well-maintained and structurally sound, to preserve their invaluable legacy for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the information provided does not directly answer the question about David's diet from the Bible. David, a significant figure in the Hebrew Bible, Christianity, and Islam, was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah. Although David is a prophet in Islam, the details about his diet in the Bible are not mentioned in the answer. In the Bible, specific dietary guidelines for David are not explicitly discussed. However, we can infer some aspects of his diet based on the cultural and religious practices during his time. The ancient Israelites followed the dietary laws outlined in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Based on these dietary laws, the following would likely be components of David's diet: 1. Meats: David would have consumed meat from animals considered \\"clean\\" according to the biblical dietary laws, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and deer. Poultry like chicken, dove, and turkey would also be part of his diet. All meat would have to be prepared according to kosher guidelines, including proper slaughtering and draining of blood. 2. Fish: Fish with fins and scales, such as salmon, trout, and tilapia, would be permitted in David's diet. Shellfish and other non-kosher seafood would not be consumed. 3. Grains: Bread, barley, and wheat were staple grains in the ancient Near East. David would have consumed bread and other grain-based products as a primary source of carbohydrates. 4. Fruits and vegetables: A diet in the ancient Near East would be incomplete without fresh fruits and vegetables. Common produce items included figs, olives, grapes, pomegranates, melons, and cucumbers. 5. Dairy products: Milk, cheese, and yogurt would have been part of David's diet. However, it is essential to note that according to the laws in the Hebrew Bible, dairy products could not be consumed in the same meal as meat. 6. Fats and oils: Olive oil was prevalent in the ancient Near East and was a central cooking ingredient in David's time. It would have been used as a primary source of fat. 7. Legumes and nuts: Almonds, pistachios, lentils, and chickpeas were commonly consumed and would likely be part of David's diet. 8. Spices and herbs: David's diet would have included a variety of seasonings, like cumin, coriander, mint, and dill. 9. Beverages: Water, wine, and vinegar were standard beverages in the Near East. David is known to have drunk wine, as mentioned in the Bible, but it is essential to note that alcohol consumption was generally moderate during his time as cultural values emphasized self-control and discipline. In conclusion, although we cannot provide explicit details about David's diet from the Bible, we can deduce his diet based on the cultural, religious, and historical context of his time. David would have followed the dietary laws outlined in the Hebrew Bible and consumed a diet comprising of various meats, fish, grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, legumes, nuts, and beverages permitted by these laws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I recently dined at [Restaurant Name] with my family, and I must say that we had an absolutely wonderful evening. From the moment we arrived, the staff was warm, welcoming, and attentive to our needs. The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, with soft lighting and comfortable seating, which made us feel right at home. The menu offered a diverse selection of dishes, including vegetarian and gluten-free options that catered to the dietary requirements of our group. We started our meal with a delicious appetizer platter that featured an array of flavors and textures, including crispy spring rolls, creamy spinach and artichoke dip, and zesty bruschetta.

Given the below context:  Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

Im also upset cuz I was outbid in eBay auction","output":"The sentiment of the tweet can be analyzed through different aspects: missing dinner, being upset, and losing an eBay auction. By examining these elements, we can determine the overall sentiment of the tweet. Firstly, the mention of not eating dinner may imply a negative sentiment due to the fact that missing a meal could be a result of a busy schedule, lack of sustenance, or a conscious decision to skip it. In any case, not having dinner can lead to the tweeter feeling hungry or dissatisfied. Secondly, the tweeter explicitly expresses their emotional state by stating they are \\"upset.\\" This word choice demonstrates a clear negative sentiment. Being upset can result from various events or emotions; in this particular tweet, the cause seems to lie in the loss of an eBay auction. Lastly, being outbid in an eBay auction suggests that the tweeter failed to secure a desired item. For most people, losing out on something they had hoped to win can invoke negative emotions, such as disappointment, frustration, and even a sense of loss. Consequently, this part of the tweet further reinforces the negative sentiment. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it is clear that the overall sentiment of this tweet is decidedly negative. The tweeter conveys their dissatisfaction about not eating dinner, explicitly mentions being upset, and is disappointed about losing out in an eBay auction, which cumulatively contribute to the negative tone of the message."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As part of the housing and credit booms, the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO), which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased. Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime MBS reported significant losses. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What are CDO as related to the housing and credit booms?","output":"Collateralized Debt Obligations, often referred to as CDOs, played a significant role in the housing and credit booms that took place in the early and mid-2000s. Understanding CDOs necessitates first understanding the general landscape of the financial industry during this period. The climate in the early 2000s was characterized by an increase in housing prices and a concurrent global surge in credit availability. A component of this credit availability came in the form of mortgages issued to homeowners, many of whom were considered subprime borrowers due to their lower credit scores or potentially unstable financial circumstances. These subprime mortgages were often offered with adjustable rates, meaning the interest rate and thus the monthly payment could fluctuate over time. In an effort to capitalize on this situation, financial institutions began to bundle together these subprime mortgages and sell them as investment opportunities. They would group many of these mortgages into pools based on their perceived level of credit risk and then sell shares in these pools to investors. When a homeowner made a mortgage payment, the money would flow through the pool and eventually be paid out as returns to the investors holding the shares. These bundled financial products came to be known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Collateralized Debt Obligations are a further step in this chain. In essence, a CDO is a type of asset-backed security, similar to MBS. However, unlike a straightforward MBS which is backed by a pool of mortgages, a CDO is often backed by a diversified pool of assets which could include things like bonds, loans, or even other MBS. The pool of assets is divided into tranches, which are essentially different risk classes. Investors can invest in different tranches based on their risk appetite. Higher risk tranches offer higher potential returns but also carry a higher risk of default. CDOs were considered financial innovations because they appeared to offer the potential for higher returns without a proportional increase in risk. A key characteristic of a CDO—and one that differentiated it from a standard MBS—is the use of tranching. Because the underlying assets are divided into tranches or slices, the CDO can cater to different risk appetites by selling different tranches to different investors. The highest-risk tranche would be the first to absorb any losses from the underlying assets, followed by the next highest risk tranche, and so on. During the housing boom, an expansion of the CDO market came in the form of synthetic CDOs. These financial products were based on credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps, and they allowed investors to speculate on the mortgage market without actually owning any mortgages. However, the downfall of CDOs came about when housing prices began to decline, and the subprime mortgages that underpinned many of the issuances started going into default. As defaults increased, the value of the underlying assets plunged, and many tranches of the CDOs became worthless, leading to significant losses among the global financial institutions that had invested heavily in them. In conclusion, CDOs were financial products, originated in the wake of the housing and credit booms, that appeared to offer the prospect of higher returns without a proportional increase in risk. They played a crucial role in the global financial crisis that followed the collapse of the housing market, and their demise served as a stark reminder of the dangers of financial innovation without adequate understanding or regulation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Upon arrival, we noticed the decor was quite outdated, giving the place a run-down feeling that didn't match the upscale image they were trying to portray. The dim lighting and uncomfortable chairs only made the ambiance worse. The service at Fancy Bistro was equally disappointing. Our server took a long time to take our order, and it was evident that they were not familiar with the menu. It took almost an hour for our food to arrive, despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't busy at the time. Moreover, when we requested additional condiments and utensils, our server forgot to bring them to the table. As for the food, it was a letdown. The steak I ordered was overcooked and lacked flavor, while the vegetables accompanying it were soggy and unappetizing. My dining companion's pasta dish tasted bland, and the sauce was watery. Both meals were overpriced for their quality, and we found that the portion sizes were quite small compared to other restaurants in the same category. In summary, my experience at Fancy Bistro was not worth the time or the expense. The poor ambiance, slow service, and unsatisfactory food have left me with no intention of returning or recommending this restaurant to anyone.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Robert Joseph Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969-70 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons. Cousy was initially drafted by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1950 NBA draft, but after he refused to report, he was picked up by Boston. Cousy took up basketball at the age of 13 as a student at St. Pascal's elementary school, and was \\"immediately hooked\\". The following year, he entered Andrew Jackson High School in St Albans. His basketball success was not immediate, and in fact he was cut from the school team in his first year. Later that year, he joined the St. Albans Lindens of the Press League, a basketball league sponsored by the Long Island Press, where he began to develop his basketball skills and gained much-needed experience. The next year, however, he was again cut during the tryouts for the school basketball team.  That same year, he fell out of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him effectively ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as \\"a fortunate event\\" and cited it as a factor in making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was sure he was going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college.  He again excelled in basketball his senior year, leading his team to the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the Journal-American All-Scholastic team. He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, and he wanted to go somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, and he was not interested in being a commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players. Did he try out again the second year?","output":"Yes, Robert Cousy tried out again for the school basketball team during his second year at Andrew Jackson High School in St. Albans. However, he was once again cut during the tryouts. Despite this setback, he continued to play and develop his basketball skills in the St. Albans Lindens of the Press League. It was only in his junior year that he managed to join the varsity squad after initially being ineligible due to failing his citizenship course. Making a significant impact in his first game with 28 points, he went on to excel in basketball, eventually leading his team to the Queens divisional championship during his senior year and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Article: KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) - Nepal has given its security personnel permission to shoot pro-Tibet demonstrators during China's Olympic flame climb to Mount Everest's summit early next month. \\"About 25 soldiers and policemen have established camps on the mountain and they have been ordered to use force if necessary to stop any anti-Chinese activities,\\" Mod Raj Dotel, spokesman for the home ministry, said Sunday. \\"This could mean shooting if necessary.\\" Security personnel will also check mountain climbers for non-essential expedition materials, Dotel added.  \\"If anyone is found with anti-Chinese material their permit will be canceled and returned from the mountain,\\" he said.  Chinese climbers plan to take the Olympic flame to the top of the world's highest peak, at 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) as part of the global relay leading up to the August 8 opening of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Spring is the most popular season for climbing Mount Everest, which straddles  the border between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China.  The Nepali government has given permits to dozens of climbers from 30 expeditions this season.  But between May 1 and May 10, climbers are  _ from going above 6,400 meters until the torch run is completed. China plans to take the Olympic flame to the summit sometime then. Bad weather conditions allow only about two opportunities in May for a push to the summit. The Chinese have not allowed any expedition to climb the mountain from the north side, according the Kathmandu representative of the Tibet China Mountaineering Association. Almost every day in the past month, Nepalese police have arrested pro-Tibet protesters from in front of the Chinese Embassy and the United Nations offices. The demonstrators are released later in the evening.   Supporters of Tibet punish the government's attitude toward the autonomous region, and many believe China should not have been awarded the honor of hosting the Olympic Games. Earlier torch relay stops in London, England; Paris, France; and San Francisco,...

The government has given security personnel permission to use force, including potentially shooting pro-Tibet demonstrators, to prevent any anti-Chinese activities during the event. Furthermore, it has allowed Chinese climbers to conduct this flame climb as part of the global relay leading up to the Summer Olympics in Beijing. The security personnel will also check mountain climbers for any anti-Chinese materials and cancel permits if any are found. This demonstrates the Nepali government's support for China's Olympic flame initiative and their intention to ensure the event proceeds without interruptions from protesters or anti-Chinese sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How are the online intermediaries protected under the European law?\\"  Context: \\"The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) and the European E-Commerce Directive (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \\"safe harbor\\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \\"mere conduit\\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Online intermediaries play a crucial role in the digital landscape, facilitating the exchange of information, content and services between parties. These intermediaries include Internet service providers (ISPs), search engines, social media platforms, and content hosting websites. To ensure the continued growth and innovation of the digital economy, online intermediaries in Europe are provided with certain protections under European law.  The European E-Commerce Directive (2000) is the primary legislative framework governing online intermediaries' liability for copyright infringement in Europe. This directive establishes three main principles that provide immunity to online intermediaries for hosting copyrighted content, namely: 'mere conduit,' 'caching,' and 'hosting.' 1. Mere Conduit (Article 12): The 'mere conduit' principle safeguards ISPs that merely transmit information from one point to another, without altering or manipulating its content. As these ISPs serve as neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge or control over the data they transmit, they are exempt from liability for any copyright infringement that may occur during this process. This principle ensures that the ISPs are not held responsible for the actions of their users and do not suffer legal consequences for enabling access to infringing content. 2. Caching (Article 13): Caching refers to the temporary storage of data for the purpose of improving the efficiency and speed of data retrieval. Online intermediaries that engage in caching activities are protected from liability if they meet certain conditions. These conditions include that the storage is temporary, automatic, and aimed at improving the service, and that the intermediary does not modify the content. Additionally, the intermediary must act expeditiously to remove the cached content upon becoming aware that it has been removed from the source or if a court orders removal. 3. Hosting (Article 14): Hosting providers, such as social media platforms and content-sharing websites, are granted immunity from liability for hosting copyrighted material if they do not have actual knowledge of the infringing content or are not aware of circumstances indicating the presence of such content. Under the 'no obligation to monitor' clause, hosting providers are not required to proactively monitor user-generated material for copyright infringement. However, if they receive a legitimate notice of infringing content by a rights holder or become aware of any unlawful content, they must act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the content to maintain their immunity. It is worth noting that the European legal framework has recently undergone reforms aiming to clarify the role and responsibilities of online intermediaries. The Digital Single Market Strategy, implemented through various legislative initiatives, including the Copyright Directive (2019), seeks to strike a balance between copyright protection, user rights, and intermediary liability. Of particular importance is Article 17 of the Copyright Directive, which imposes specific obligations on certain online content-sharing service providers to obtain authorization from rights holders for hosting copyrighted content. This article potentially narrows the liability exemptions for platforms and requires them to implement robust mechanisms to prevent the availability of unauthorized content. In summary, online intermediaries in Europe enjoy protection under the E-Commerce Directive, which provides them with limited immunity from liability for copyright infringement, based on principles such as 'mere conduit,' 'caching,' and 'hosting.' The European legal landscape is continually evolving to adapt to the fast-paced digital environment, ensuring that the rights of content creators, users, and online intermediaries are adequately protected and balanced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"\\"Feel pain\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the following reasons: Step 1: Analyzing the question The question asks what an animal does when it becomes old. This implies that we are looking for an action or experience that is specifically related to the aging process in an animal. Step 2: Analyzing the possible answers We have the following possible answers: live long, leave home, feel pain, eating, and sense fear in human. It's important to note which of these answers are connected to the aging process of an animal. Step 3: Identifying relevant answers Among the possible answers, \\"live long\\" is an expectation of aging but doesn't describe a specific action or experience. \\"Leave home\\" isn't necessarily related to aging. \\"Eating\\" is a general action that all animals do regardless of age. \\"Sense fear in human\\" is not directly related to the animal's aging process.  Step 4: Finding the most plausible answer Out of the given options, \\"feel pain\\" is the most plausible answer aligned with human common sense because as animals age, they are more likely to experience pain related to various age-related health issues (e.g., arthritis, joint pain, or muscle weakness). Pain is a sensory experience that is naturally associated with decline in health, which is common in the aging process.

If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the last crisis during cold war to escalate world powers?","output":"The last major crisis during the Cold War that escalated tensions among world powers was the Able Archer 83 exercise, which took place in November 1983. This was a realistic NATO military exercise simulating a potential conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, particularly focusing on communication between NATO countries. During the exercise, the Soviet Union misinterpreted the simulation as preparations for an actual nuclear attack on their territory. The heightened alert level and increased military activity on both sides brought the world uncomfortably close to a real confrontation. This event was marked by high levels of tension and mistrust between the superpowers, with both the United States and the Soviet Union fearing that a conflict could spiral into a full-scale war. A contributing factor to this tense atmosphere was the deployment of Pershing II intermediate-range ballistic missiles by the United States in Western Europe earlier that year. This move escalated the arms race and further strained relations between the two superpowers. Additionally, the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union in September 1983 added to the existing tensions. The Able Archer 83 incident exemplifies the delicate nature of the balance of power during the Cold War era and how easily misinterpretation or miscommunication could have led to catastrophic consequences. Fortunately, the exercise ended without any direct military confrontation, and the crisis was ultimately resolved peacefully. It served as an important lesson for both the U.S. and the USSR about the importance of clear communication and the dangers of miscalculations in geopolitics. As a result, it contributed to the ongoing efforts towards diplomatic solutions and arms control negotiations in later years, eventually leading to the end of the Cold War."},{"instruction":"This task involves creating questions from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning).

Passage: On November 18, 1918 the People's Council of Latvia proclaimed the Independence of the Republic of Latvia and created the Latvian Provisional Government headed by Kārlis Ulmanis.On December 1, 1918 the newly proclaimed republic was invaded by Soviet Russia.Much of the invadinig army in Latvia consisted of Red Latvian Riflemen, which made the invasion easier. The Soviet offensive met little resistance. In the north Alūksne was taken on December 7, Valka on December 18, and Cēsis on December 23, in the south Daugavpils was taken on December 9 and Pļaviņas on December 17. Riga was captured by the Red Army on January 3, 1919. By the end of January the Latvian Provisional Government and remaining German units had retreated all the way to Liepāja, but then the Red offensive stalled along the Venta river. The Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic was officially proclaimed on January 13 with the political, economic, and military backing of the Soviet Russia.","output":"1. How many days after the Independence of the Republic of Latvia was Alūksne taken by the Soviet offensive? Answer: 19 days Reasoning: The Independence of the Republic of Latvia was proclaimed on November 18, 1918, and Alūksne was taken on December 7. To find the difference, count the days between the two dates: November (30-18) = 12 days and December (7-1) = 6 days. Add the numbers: 12 + 6 = 19 days. 2. How many days elapsed between the capture of Daugavpils and the capture of Riga by the Red Army? Answer: 25 days Reasoning: Daugavpils was taken on December 9, and Riga was captured on January 3. To find the difference, count the days between the two dates: December (31-9) = 22 days and January (3-1) = 2 days. Add the numbers: 22 + 2 = 25 days. 3. What is the difference in days between the capture of Pļaviņas and the official proclamation of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic? Answer: 27 days Reasoning: Pļaviņas was taken on December 17, and the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic was officially proclaimed on January 13. To find the difference, count the days between the two dates: December (31-17) = 14 days and January (13-1) = 12 days. Add the numbers: 14 + 12 = 27 days. 4. How many days after the capture of Valka did the Soviet Russia invade the newly proclaimed Republic of Latvia?

In total, how many days did it take for the Red Army to capture both Alūksne and Pļaviņas starting from the invasion of the newly proclaimed Republic of Latvia? Answer: 30 days Reasoning: The invasion was on December 1, Alūksne was taken on December 7, and Pļaviņas on December 17. To find how many days it took to capture both, count the days between December 1 and December 17: December (17-1) = 30 days."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let c be the total cost of the vacation, and x be the cost per person when divided among 3 people.    So, we have the relationship: c = 3x 2. If the total cost had been divided equally among 4 people, the cost per person would have been 60 less.    In this scenario, the cost per person is (x - 60).    Therefore, we have another relationship: c = 4(x - 60) 3. Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables (c and x):    c = 3x    c = 4(x - 60)     4. We can substitute the first equation into the second one:    3x = 4(x - 60) 5. Now, let's solve for x:    3x = 4x - 240    240 = x 6. Now that we have found the value of x, let's use the first equation to find the total cost (c):    c = 3x    c = 3 * 240    c = 720 The total cost of the vacation is 720.

However, the Raiders orchestrated a successful goal-line stand, forcing Denver to turn the ball over on downs after a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line was stopped. Two plays later, however, Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell was intercepted by Denver safety Renaldo Hill after throwing from his own end zone. The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful. They went 56 yards in over 8 minutes, leading to a 48-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Denver then drove 76 yards, although Oakland again held Denver out of the end zone, leading to a 21-yard Prater field goal and giving the Broncos a 13-3 lead going into halftime. Denver then opened the half with another scoring drive, this time going 80 yards in 8 plays and scoring on a 7-yard run by rookie running back Knowshon Moreno. It was the first touchdown of Moreno's NFL career. Oakland was forced to punt on their next drive. However, on Denver's first play from scrimmage, running back Correll Buckhalter fumbled the ball at their own 16-yard line, giving Oakland the ball in Denver territory for just the 3rd time on the day. However, 2 plays later, Raiders running back Darren McFadden fumbled the ball for the second time on the day (the first time was recovered by Oakland), giving Denver the ball back at their own 11. They then drove 88 yards in 16 plays and over 8 minutes, although the Raiders again held them out of the end zone, leading to a Prater 24-yard field goal. The Broncos won the game primarily on the strength of their running game and the defense. Correll Buckhalter ran 14 times for 108 yards, while rookie Knowshown Moreno ran 21 times for 90 yards. Overall, the Broncos had 215 yards rushing on the day. The defense held the Raiders to just 137 total yards and 9 first downs, caused 2 interceptions and 1 fumble, and also sacked JaMarcus Russell 3 times, 2 of them by star defensive end Elvis Dumervil (who had 4 in the previous game against the Cleveland Browns). Russell had just 61 yards passing on 21 attempts with 2 interceptions, giving him a quarterback rating of 22.6. Kyle Orton had 157 yards passing on 23 attempts with 1 touchdown and 0 interceptions, giving him a respectable 92.1 rating.

Jean-Baptiste Frederic Isidor, Baron Thielemans (29 April 1922 - 22 August 2016), known professionally as Toots Thielemans, was a Belgian-American jazz musician. He was known for his harmonica playing, as well as his guitar, whistling skills, and composing. According to jazz historian Ted Gioia, his most important contribution was in \\"championing the humble harmonica\\", which Thielemans made into a \\"legitimate voice in jazz\\". He eventually became the \\"preeminent\\" jazz harmonica player. During the early 1980s Thielemans was a guest a number of times on Late Night with David Letterman. He has performed with the bassist Jaco Pastorius, and in 1983 he contributed to Billy Joel's album An Innocent Man, in the song, \\"Leave A Tender Moment Alone.\\" (The two later collaborated on this selection in concert, and this was recorded on video.) A year later, he appeared on the Julian Lennon song \\"Too Late for Goodbyes\\" from the album Valotte.  In 1984, he recorded with Billy Eckstine on the singer's final album (I Am a Singer), featuring ballads and standards arranged and conducted by Angelo DiPippo. In the 1990s, Thielemans embarked on theme projects that included world music. In 1998 he released a French-flavoured album titled Chez Toots featuring guest singer Johnny Mathis.  During those years, he often recorded songs as personal tributes to those who were influential during his career. On Chez Toots, for example, he included \\"Dance For Victor,\\" which he dedicated to his sometimes keyboard accompanist, Victor Feldman. Similarly, he recorded \\"Waltz for Sonny\\" as a tribute to saxophonist Sonny Rollins. In June 1998, at Germany's Jazzbaltica, he paid tribute to Frank Sinatra who died a month earlier. And during the first Caspian Jazz and Blues Festival in Azerbaijan in 2002, he performed his recorded version of \\"Imagine,\\" his tribute to its writer, John Lennon.  Thielmans was well liked for his modesty and kind demeanor in his native Belgium, and was known for describing himself as a Brussels \\"ket,\\" which means \\"street kid\\" in old Brussels slang.

Around 5.3% of middle-school students reported using e-cigarettes in 2015, which is up from 3.9% in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. E-cigarette usage among high school students has hit 16%, and that’s significantly up from the 1.5% who vaped in 2011. Such is the popularity of e-cigarettes, that it has become the most used tobacco product among teenagers, with around 3 million reportedly using then. Overall, around 4.7 million middle and high school students are using any form of tobacco product, and when dissected, roughly one in four high school students and one in 13 middle school students use some kind of tobacco product. The study of tobacco usage among youth is important, as while smoking rates have declined in the past decade, 80% of adult smokers first try smoking by the age of 18. What remains unclear, however, is whether vaping leads to smoking. In the CDC’s latest report, the rise in e-cig usage is in tandem with a gradual decrease in the use of normal cigarettes—among all high school students, that has declined from 15.8% in 2011 to 9.3% last year. It provides some proof that e-cigarettes, which are generally regarded as less toxic than cigarettes, may not lead to teens picking up the smoking habit. “We do not have any strong evidence that it is encouraging smoking among kids but neither do we have good evidence that it won’t over time,” Kenneth E.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Process:  - You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose diaphragm expands for more air happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the proposed perturbation, in which the diaphragm expands more than usual, can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of gas exchange, potentially leading to less efficient oxygen delivery to the body. Direct effects: When the diaphragm expands more than usual, it creates a greater negative pressure within the thoracic cavity. This increased negative pressure can lead to a higher volume of air being inhaled into the lungs. Theoretically, this should result in more oxygen being delivered to the body. However, if the rate of expansion of the diaphragm outpaces the lungs' capacity to expand and the alveoli's ability to perform gas exchange efficiently, it might prevent the oxygen from properly diffusing across the alveolar-capillary membrane into the bloodstream. As a result, an increased diaphragm expansion can potentially lead to less efficient oxygen delivery to the body. Indirect effects: The increased expansion of the diaphragm can affect other aspects of the respiratory system, which in turn may impact the efficiency of oxygen delivery. For example: 1. Altered ventilation-perfusion ratio: The efficiency of gas exchange depends on the appropriate matching of ventilation (airflow) and perfusion (blood flow) within the lungs. If the diaphragm expands more than normal, it can potentially lead to a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion within the lung regions. This extreme expansion may overinflate some alveoli in the well-ventilated areas, compressing neighboring capillaries and impeding blood flow. At the same time, poorly inflated areas receive reduced airflow. Consequently, oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange decreases, resulting in less oxygen delivery to the body. 2. Respiratory muscle fatigue: If the diaphragm continuously expands more than necessary, it can cause respiratory muscle fatigue over time. This state of fatigue can impair the efficiency of breathing, leading to shallow and rapid breaths, which do not allow sufficient airflow for proper oxygen exchange. Consequently, less oxygen is delivered to the body. 3. Impact on lung compliance and elasticity: The increased diaphragmatic expansion can potentially stress the lung tissue, compromising its compliance and elasticity. By stiffening the lungs, it could make it more difficult for the lungs to expand sufficiently for effective gas exchange, and eventually result in less oxygen delivery to the body. In summary, although the perturbation of the diaphragm expanding more than usual might seem initially beneficial by taking in more air, it can ultimately affect the efficiency of oxygen delivery to the body. Both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory system can occur, including impaired gas exchange, respiratory muscle fatigue, and impact on lung compliance and elasticity. It is essential to maintain proper diaphragmatic expansion and respiratory mechanics for optimal oxygen delivery to the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article: Encourage your partner to avoid sleeping on their back. This can make snoring worse by putting pressure on your partner's diaphragm. Some have recommended sleeping with something uncomfortable, like a tennis ball, sewn into the back of a shirt.  This will make it awkward for your partner to sleep on their back and forces them to sleep in another way. Being overweight is a common cause of snoring.  The extra weight affects the lungs and neck, making airflow blocked or strained during sleep.  Being overweight is not always a cause of snoring, however, it does increase the probability that snoring will occur.  Excess body fat will increase the chances of developing sleep apnea.  Changing aspects of  a lifestyle, such as losing weight, are usually recommended starting points to stop snoring.  Have your partner ask your doctor for more information on how you can best lose weight. Nasal strips are an over-the-counter method of improving airflow through the nose.  The nasal strip works by slightly pulling open, and keeping open, the nostrils.  The improved airflow will help reduce snoring.  Falling asleep with the nasal strip on may be unusual at first.  Continued use will help your partner get used to the nasal strip. These strips won't be helpful to anyone suffering from sleep apnea because sleep apnea is caused by collapsed soft tissues in the back of the throat. Alcohol consumption and smoking can affect the throat and respiratory systems.  Have your partner reduce the use of either to help prevent snoring from occurring.  Alcohol causes the neck and tongue to relax which can obstruct airflow. Never drink alcohol right before sleep as this will make snoring worse. Smoking damages the throat and respiratory system.  By reducing the amount your partner smokes, the chances of snoring occurring will also be reduced. Remember that snoring is a symptom of some other issue.  Have your partner visit your doctor to determine exactly what the cause of their snoring may be.  Examine the following list of possibilities to get an idea of what to expect:  Nasal blockages.  This may be due to chronic congestion or the configuration of your nasal passages, such as a deviated septum. Untreated allergies.  Allergies can produce swelling of tissue in the nose and throat, as well as cause mucus production that can make breathing difficult. Obstructive sleep apnea.  Sleep apnea is a potentially serious medical condition that your doctor will want to address.  This occurs when your throat tissue blocks your airway and prevents breathing entirely. If other options have not put an end to the snoring, ask your doctor about surgical options.  Depending on your partners situation, there are a few different surgeries that may be recommend by your doctor:  If your partners palate is the cause of their snoring, their doctor may recommend palatal implants.  These are strands of polyester filament that are placed within the soft palate the mouth, which stiffen and prevent snoring. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) may be recommended if your partner has excess or loose tissue in or around the throat.  By removing and tightening this tissue, this cause of snoring is eliminated. Laser and radio/sonic based treatments can also be used to shrink any excessive amounts of tissue in the throat.  These are both outpatient procedures and are not as invasive as traditional surgery. Summary:","output":"To help your partner stop snoring, make sure they don't sleep on their back, as it can make snoring worse. They can try losing weight if they are overweight because extra fat can cause snoring. They could use nasal strips to help them breathe better at night. Drinking less alcohol and not smoking can also help stop snoring. If the snoring continues, your partner should see a doctor to find out the cause, which may be allergies, a blocked nose, or a condition called sleep apnea. If nothing else works, the doctor might suggest special treatments or surgeries to stop the snoring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Plot title: The Ring Movie plot: Two high school students, Katie Embry and Becca Kotler, have a sleepover and discuss the urban legend of a cursed videotape that will kill anyone seven days after watching it. Katie claims she and three friends watched said videotape, but Becca does not believe her. Shortly after, supernatural phenomena occurs around Katieâs house and she is killed by an unseen force. Becca, witnessing Katieâs death, is institutionalised. At Katieâs funeral, her aunt Rachel Keller, a journalist from Seattle, is asked by her sister Ruth to investigate Katieâs bizarre death and deformed corpse.

The woman tried to put the new bra inside the drawer but the","output":"drawer was too small and cluttered with various other garments, making it incredibly difficult for her to make room for the new addition to her collection. The cramped space was already overflowing with a medley of her essential wardrobe items, ranging from delicate lace undergarments and versatile sports bras to vibrantly colored scarves and comfortable, everyday socks. Each item was meticulously folded and arranged, albeit tightly packed, to optimize the limited space within the small, wooden compartment. In an attempt to accommodate the new bra, she carefully began sifting through the existing contents, evaluating the necessity of each item as she attempted to create a comfortable nook for the pristine undergarment. The bra in her hands was exquisite, gifted to her by a close friend as a symbol of love and support. Crafted from the finest fabric, it boasted intricate floral designs with delicate lace trimmings, making her feel both comfortable and confident when she wore it. The addition of this garment held significant sentimental value, thus adding to her determination to find the ideal place for it within her drawer. As she gently pushed aside a vibrant, patterned scarf, she discovered that by folding it differently, she could maximize the available space and create a small pocket just large enough for the new bra. With steadfast hands, she delicately folded the scarf into a compact square, allowing her to clear the necessary room needed for the new undergarment. Cautiously, she maneuvered the bra into position, taking great care to not disrupt the surrounding items, while ensuring that it maintained its shape and quality. Although the drawer was still exceedingly full, her efforts granted her the ability to accommodate the latest addition to her collection. The color of the new bra blended seamlessly with the assortment of garments within the drawer, creating a visually pleasing arrangement that brought her a sense of contentment. The act of organizing and making room for what mattered most to her reinforced the importance of cherishing cherished possessions and adapting to change, even within the seemingly small and trivial aspects of life. Satisfied with her accomplishment, she carefully closed the drawer, preserving the order within as she went about her day. The memory of this moment would forever serve as a gentle reminder of the value in making room for the things and people that truly matter in life, while also highlighting the need to declutter and reevaluate one's priorities from time to time.

Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars  . But how do we make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these: a) Each nest must have six boards   for its cover and floor, for its left and right sides, and for its front and back sides. Don't make the boards too slippery  . b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a \\"door\\". The \\"door\\" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest. d) One piece of the board should be easy to open. e) Don't forget to colour the nest. When we're watching birds, we have to   _  . A) look after the birds more often B) use the binoculars to catch the birds C) hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual D) catch the birds at last Answer:","output":"When we find a bird nest, it indeed provides us an excellent opportunity to observe and learn about birds. Since birds take care of their babies and lay eggs between April and June, it's the perfect time for bird-watching. The baby birds are too young to leave the nest, so the parents go out frequently to look for food, returning every few minutes. This behavior makes it easier for us to watch them. While watching birds, it is essential to remain hidden from their view as much as possible. Hiding near the nest and using binoculars to observe them from a close distance allows the birds to continue their natural behavior without disturbance. It is crucial not to disturb the birds while observing them. As for creating a bird nest, a good one has to be made with care, ensuring it is sturdy, thick, and comfortable. Following these steps can help in building an ideal nest: a) Use six boards to construct the nest, which will provide the cover and floor, the left and right sides, and the front and back sides. Make sure the boards are not too slippery, so the birds can comfortably use the nest. b) Carve a small hole in the front of the nest to function as a \\"door\\". Ensure that the entrance is large enough for the birds to fly in and out without difficulty. c) The nest design should prevent rainwater from entering, keeping the inside dry and safe for the birds and their offspring. d) One of the boards should be easy to open, allowing for periodic inspection and maintenance without unnecessarily disrupting the birds. e) Color the nest with natural and non-toxic paint to blend in with the surrounding environment, providing comfort and safety for the birds. When we are watching birds, it is essential to: C) Hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual Choosing this option ensures that we are not causing any disturbance or stress to the birds. As observers, we should minimize any impact on their natural behavior, allowing them to go about their daily activities without disruption.

The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

After putting the wire in the hole, we hold one end of the wire with a tool called a vise (it's like a strong pinchy thing). Then, we grab the long piece of wood with both hands and slide it along the wire, and it helps straighten the wire. Choice 2 is very similar to Choice 1, but with a shorter piece of wood, only half an inch long. It's like using a small eraser instead of a long pencil. For a 5-year-old, let me say: Imagine using a big pencil (Choice 1) or a small eraser (Choice 2) to smooth out a messy piece of spaghetti (the wire). Which one do you think will be easier to hold and use? The better solution is Choice 1: using an 8-inch long piece of wood because it is easier to hold and use with both hands, and it will help us straighten the wire more effectively."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cheryl Tyler: Something Worth Fighting For Jan. 17, 2012, 6:34 a.m. In Principal’s Office, a regular feature of SchoolBook, a city school principal is interviewed for insights into school management and the life of a school leader. What do you think makes a good principal? Join the conversation below. When word got out in the fall that Public School 277 in the Bronx had landed on a list of schools that could be closed by the Department of Education because it had received an F on its progress report, the school’s students, parents and teachers went on a campaign to convince officials that their school had been working hard to raise achievement in the struggling neighborhood. They wrote letters. They crowded into meetings at the school auditorium. They described a school where students are engaged and teachers feel respected for their work. In December, when they learned that school officials had decided to keep the school open, “you could hear the resounding cheer throughout the school,’’ said Cheryl Tyler, the principal. Deputy Chancellor Marc Sternberg said, “We saw the school has a motivated principal and energized staff with a vision for improving student achievement.” Ms. Tyler, 64, who became a teacher in 1970, said she knows there is much work ahead. Her school, located in a cheerfully decorated building, has 529 students, 40 percent of whom are considered English language learners or classified as special education students. Ms. Tyler’s salary is 133,000 a year. You came here in 2006. What was the school like then? There was a very different vision of the school. Most of the teachers felt that their work was to ensure that kids were quiet and compliant and contained. And because of that — kids are very smart — many of the kids weren’t engaged. I think that the curriculum was not a curriculum that really mattered to the kids. It was certainly a school that had done some important work and some effective work and needed a coherent curriculum, and teachers needed to find a place that they felt they were really making a difference for the kids. And how would you describe P.S. 277 now? What I like to think now is that we’ve become a community of ideas. When we have a problem now, or we’re in some kind of crisis mode, we come together as a community. We think about it, we learn from that crisis and we try to figure out ways together to resolve it, because separately we cannot make our school better. Did you choose to come to this school? I did. I came out of the Leadership Academy. One of the goals of the Leadership Academy is to put their graduates in schools that are in need. Over my career I’ve taught in Harlem and the Upper West Side, and I’ve always felt that the important work — it’s all important work — but the really important work was teaching in Harlem, being in the South Bronx, being in the high poverty neighborhoods of Buffalo when I was in Teacher Corps. You got an F on your school progress report, after earning an A in 2009 and a C in 2010. How hard was it to hear that your school might close because of poor performance? It was devastating. It was devastating on a lot of levels. We know as a community what our kids are doing. We know how incredibly important those standardized tests are. We also know that it’s not enough for our kids to answer other people’s questions. We want them to be the ones asking the questions. We want them to also have the skills and the strategies and the kind of thinking that they need when those answers don’t make sense, to push back. Here, they’re always analyzing, they’re always theorizing, they’re always determining the validity of an argument. That’s really what we know our kids are doing. You see them in the morning with their noses in books. So it was devastating because we are working very hard to figure out what’s happening when our kids are taking those standardized tests because we know that they’re capable and we know that our teaching is effective and strong and powerful. They were devastated and constantly asking themselves: “What are we going to do? How are we going to ensure that the rest of the world sees us in light of what we’re doing because our test scores do not reflect the work that we’re doing.” What are you doing about that? We analyzed the data. We looked at our monthly assessments. We looked at our students’ writing, we hold it next to a rubric, we look at reading levels monthly. We look at math assessments monthly, and our social studies and science assessments in the context of common core standards. So we found a couple of things. One of the things, and this was a citywide pattern, but our kids in particular, need more work with nonfiction. We’ve implemented an additional half-hour a day of nonfiction, or reading in content in social studies. We’ve been given a gift of 8,000 nonfiction books by the Reading and Writing Project at Teachers College. Isn’t that throwing a lot at the problem? Every child is reading at a different level. For example, the fourth grade is studying civil rights. We don’t use textbooks, so we have to make sure that every child in the fourth grade has a book on his or her level, and not just one, but several. So it does seem like a lot, but you might need 20 books for one child. No, and the reason is that they’re ineffective when children are not all reading at the same level. You also said you’re doing more whole book assessments. What were you doing before? We were assessing our kids with short passages and asking them to retell the passage and to do inference work, and they were at grade level. But when it came to taking the test, they weren’t. We learned that the short text gave us a picture, but it wasn’t enough. We know a certain student, for example, can read two pages, and we know he can retell it and he can do some inferential work and theories about character development. What we didn’t know is whether in these books, can he accumulate information from chapter to chapter? Is he developing ideas as he moves through the chapters? Is he able to develop theories about characters? Those things now are being measured because we’re reading whole books. Have your methods changed? Is professional development more intense? One of the things we’re looking very closely at is I.E.P.-Special Education students and English Language Learners. Our children in general education were performing at about the city average on multiple choice questions. It’s our children who have I.E.P.’s (Individual Educational Plans) and the E.L.L.’s who we really, really need to take a close look at. That counts for 40 percent of our population. All our teachers are receiving really, really high-quality professional development from Teachers College and we have staff developers from there, and Lucy Calkins is deeply committed to our school; in fact she’s the one who sent us the 8,000 books. (Editor’s note: Lucy Calkins is the founding director of the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project.) What did it take to convince D.O.E. not to shut you down? I didn’t do anything except make it very clear to people that we had something worth fighting for, and I think they all believed that. Teachers are here because they see something bigger. They see that what we’re doing is not just teaching, that it’s more than just a job. They’re committed to something bigger. They felt that and there was an outpouring of e-mails. Some of the teachers’ parents even wrote. They said how proud they were of their kids and how committed their children were to being here and to the school and to the community. The people who supervise some of our student teachers from Teachers College wrote letters too, and parents and students wrote letters, too. You were devastated at first. Has that turned into a feeling of determination? You said it perfectly. We’re extraordinarily relieved and grateful that the work we’re doing is appreciated and that it was seen. We were under a lot of scrutiny and we felt that people really understood what we were doing, the people who were making those decisions. And now it’s, “O.K., deep breath.” Maria Newman is the community editor for SchoolBook. Follow her on Twitter @newmaria.

Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Packers the Eagles flew to Ford Field for an NFC Duel with the Lions. The Lions looked good early In the first quarter, but with 11:15 remaining, Shaun Hill was intercepted by Nate Allen. Just four plays into the following drive, the Eagles took the early lead when QB Michael Vick bombed a 45-yard TD pass to deep threat WR DeSean Jackson.Detroit replied, driving 76 yards in 6 plays with RB Jahvid Best hauling a 14-yard touchdown run, taking 3:00 minutes off the clock. After three combined punts, the Eagles then fell behind in the 2nd quarter when kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 49-yard field goal. This was followed by QB Shaun Hill slinging a screen pass to RB Jahvid Best, who took it 75 yards for a touchdown, widening the lead to 17-7. The possession took only three plays and barely a minute off the clock. Then the Eagles replied with an 11 play, 75 yard drive that ended with RB LeSean McCoy taking in a 14-yard TD run. After a Lions punt, the Eagles marched 89 yards in less than a minute with QB Michael Vick throwing a 9-yard TD pass to WR Jeremy Maclin. The Eagles led 21-17 at halftime. On their second possession of the third quarter, the Eagles scored again, with RB LeSean McCoy hammering home a 4-yard TD run. Things got worse for the Lions, as Shaun Hill was intercepted on their next possession by Ellis Hobbs. They managed to force a punt, but wasted a 12 play, 48 yard drive that took 5:49 off the clock. On 4th-and-1 at the Eagles 29, Jahvid Best was stuffed for no gain and the Lions turned it over on downs. Worse yet, the drive took into the fourth quarter. The Eagles seemingly put the game away on their next drive when LeSean McCoy scampered off to the races on a 46-yard TD run on 3rd-and-16 with just 6:27 left, and the Eagles lead 35-17. However, the Lions roared back with RB Jahvid Best finishing off an 85-yard drive with a 2-yard TD run, making the score 35-24 with 4:15 remaining. After forcing a three-and-out, the Lions stormed 56 yards in just 6 plays, culminating with Hill completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson (With a successful 2-point conversion). The Lions recovered the onside kick with 1:50 left, but four straight incompletions ended any chance of a miracle comeback.

He knew that his happiness would only feel more meaningful if he could achieve something significant alongside it. So, he started his journey towards finding his passion and being more productive in his daily life. During his early days of introspection, Raul realized he had always enjoyed being close to nature. As a kid, he would often wander off into nearby forests and spend his time observing the birds and animals. This passion for nature had always been inside him, lying dormant. Once he realized this, Raul knew it was time to reignite that flame and use it as a catalyst for productivity. By combining his love for nature with his newfound drive to be productive, Raul started exploring opportunities to work with environmental organizations. He volunteered at a local animal shelter and signed up for workshops to learn more about conservation and wildlife protection. With each passing day, Raul could feel his satisfaction growing as he made a tangible impact on the world around him. Within a few months, Raul had gained considerable knowledge and experience in the field of environmental conservation. He soon came across an opportunity to help with a reforestation project in a nearby town. This project aimed to restore a patch of land that had been devastated by illegal logging activities. Raul was thrilled to join the project. He loved the idea of helping bring back life to the damaged area, and he saw it as the perfect opportunity to put his skills to the test and be even more productive. Starting early in the mornings, Raul and the other volunteers would plant saplings and care for the young trees, ensuring they had everything they needed to grow strong and healthy. They also built fences around the reforested area to keep away grazing animals, and collaborated with the local community to raise awareness about the importance of protecting the environment. Raul discovered that the sense of accomplishment he felt when he saw the saplings grow and thrive was truly unparalleled. Moreover, the friendships he formed along the way with like-minded individuals provided him with a sense of belonging and camaraderie. With each passing day, Raul felt more fulfilled. After months of hard work, Raul and the other volunteers finally saw the fruits of their labor. The reforestation project had successfully transformed a barren area into a lush, green haven for wildlife. As Raul looked around at the beautiful, thriving environment he and his team had created, he couldn't help but feel immense pride and satisfaction. Through his dedication to being productive and working towards a cause that he was passionate about, Raul had found a sense of fulfillment that went beyond fleeting happiness. He knew that he had made a lasting impact on the world and also, on his own life. In pursuing productivity, Raul had not only found purpose - he had also found lasting happiness. Now, whenever Raul thought back on his decision to chase productivity, he knew he had made the right choice. He was living proof that productive people felt fulfilled later on, and he couldn't wait to see what the future held in store for him. With newfound determination and a deep sense of purpose, Raul continued to dedicate himself to making the world a better place, one tree at a time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An Iranian man should be sentenced to having his eyes gouged out after pouring acid over a young girl's face leaving her blind, an Iranian court has ruled. Opposition group, The National Council of Resistance of Iran, said the man could have his right ear and nose cut off as punishment for attacking the girl with acid, causing her to lose her eyesight and right ear. The man was convicted last October of intentionally attacking the girl, haartez.com reported. President Hassan Rohani won a surprise election last year, after pledging more openness with the West. But an increased use of the death penalty has dashed hopes the country's will improve its human rights record, the UN said. The national council said Iran's high court defended cutting off the body parts of those found guilty of a crime, and removing eyes, as part of the country's judicial system. Last month, the state-run Mehr news. agency, reported another Iranian man was sentenced to have one hand and. one foot cut off as punishment for an unspecified crime. As many as 95 people are thought to have been executed in Iran this year. The dramatic rise in the use of the death penalty has dashed hopes for human rights reform under President Hassan Rohani, the United Nations said earlier this year. President Rohani won a surprise election last year, after pledging more openness with the West. In September, the country released dozens of political prisoners, prompting hopes Iran would improve their human rights record. 'There were some encouraging signs last year where political prisoners were released ... But it appears at least in the past seven weeks that in fact executions have been scaled up,' UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a news briefing. 'We regret that the new government has not changed its approach to the death penalty and continues to impose capital punishment for a wide range of offences. We urge the government to immediately halt executions and to institute a moratorium.' Last year Iran executed between 500 and 625 people, including at least 28 women and two children, Ms Shamdasani said.

These types of punishments, in which body parts are removed or mutilated, can be seen as a violation of basic human rights and have received widespread international condemnation. It is essential that Iran reevaluate its judicial system and reconsider the use of these harsh and inhumane punishments, especially when it comes to non-violent crimes and those committed by minors.

Write a title for this article: REPORTING FROM SEOUL -- In another corporate sputter for beleaguered Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp., the company announced Wednesday that it will recall more than 420,000 vehicles in the U.S. in connection with potential steering problems. The safety recall to replace what the company termed “the crankshaft pulley on the V6 engine” affects 550,000 cars worldwide -- 283,200 Toyota and 137,000 Lexus vehicles. The problem reportedly affects 38,000 cars in Japan and an additional 25,000 in Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, 14,000 vehicles face recall along with 10,000 in the Middle East and 14,000 in Asia outside Japan. There have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to the problems, Toyota said in a release from its American headquarters in Torrance, Calif. If not corrected, the outer ring of the engine's crankshaft pulley may become misaligned with the inner ring, causing noise or a warning signal to light up. The belt for the power steering pump may become detached from the pulley, making it suddenly more difficult to turn the driving wheel, the release said. Since September 2009, Toyota has issued more than 13 million product recalls in the U.S. alone. With the company facing hundreds of lawsuits, safety experts and industry analysts contend that quality problems could haunt the world's largest automaker for years to come, affecting both its reputation and bottom line. In February, Toyota announced that it would recall 2.17 million vehicles to correct mechanical defects that could cause them to accelerate out of control. The latest U.S. recall includes the 2004 and 2005 Camry, Highlander, Sienna and Solara, the 2004 Avalon and the 2006 Highlander HV. The Lexus recall affects the 2004 and 2005 ES330 and RX330 and 2006 RX400h, officials said. Starting in January, Toyota said, the company will mail owners a notification to make an appointment with an authorized dealer to have their cars inspected once a sufficient number of replacement parts have been produced. Meanwhile, consumers who detect any abnormal noises are asked to make an appointment to have the vehicle inspected, the release said. The company urged owners to with questions to visit the company's websites at www.toyota.com/recall or www.lexus.com/recall. They can also contact Toyota in the U.S. at 800-331-4331 or Lexus at 800-255-3987.

Context: The foreign debt of the Socialist Republic of Romania were loans made by Socialist Republic of Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu from international creditors denominated in hard currencies. These loans were used to buy technology, equipment and raw materials needed for the industrialization of the country. Hypothesis: International creditors loaned the Democratic Republic of Romania some soft currencies.","output":"Based on the given context, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"International creditors loaned the Democratic Republic of Romania some soft currencies\\" is true. The context provided specifies that the foreign debt of the Socialist Republic of Romania comprised loans made under Nicolae Ceaușescu from international creditors denominated in hard currencies. For a deeper understanding of the situation, let's delve into the distinction between hard currencies and soft currencies, along with the information available in the context. Hard currencies are those that are widely accepted around the world and easily convertible into other currencies. They usually come from nations with stable economies and lower levels of inflation and fear of devaluation. Some examples of hard currencies include the US Dollar, the Euro, the British Pound, and the Japanese Yen. The preference for hard currencies in international transactions is primarily due to their reliability in maintaining their value over time, unlike soft currencies. Soft currencies, on the other hand, are less stable compared to hard currencies. They often suffer from high inflation rates and devaluations and are not easily convertible into other currencies. These currencies are typically associated with developing and less economically stable countries. As a result, soft currencies are less desirable for international transactions since they carry a higher risk. Returning to the context provided, it is explicitly stated that the Socialist Republic of Romania borrowed funds from international creditors denominated in hard currencies. The primary purpose of these loans was to facilitate the purchase of essential resources such as technology, equipment, and raw materials to advance the industrialization of the country. Given the nature of international transactions and the risks associated with soft currencies, it is reasonable to assume that the loans were indeed made in hard currencies, which are more secure and reliable for international transactions. In conclusion, the given context only provides evidence for loans in hard currencies extended to the Socialist Republic of Romania. To support the hypothesis that international creditors loaned the Democratic Republic of Romania some soft currencies, we would need additional information suggesting such transactions took place. Until that evidence is available, we cannot draw the hypothesis that the Democratic Republic of Romania received loans in soft currencies from international creditors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences are discussing financial market indices, specifically referring to the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index, which establishes a context of similarity. They both mention a decline in the respective indices, indicating a potentially negative market trend that could be of interest to investors watching these indices. However, there are significant differences in the details presented in each sentence, which is the reason for not rating the similarity higher than 2.5. 1. The first sentence is discussing the broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which tracks 500 large companies listed on US stock exchanges. It is focusing on the current value of the index itself and mentions a small decrease of 0.04 points, or 0 percent, ending at 971.52 points. This information provides a snapshot of the index's performance at a specific moment in time. 2. In contrast, the second sentence is discussing the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index futures, specifically for the month of June, which are financial contracts speculating on the future value of the S&P 500 index. This sentence also brings in comparison with Nasdaq futures, which are similar contracts for the Nasdaq Composite Index. Here, the S&P 500 futures are down 2.60 points at 965.70, and Nasdaq futures are down 7.50 points at 1,183.50. This information is providing insights into market participants' expectations about the future direction of these indices. To summarize, these sentences share common ground in discussing the S&P 500 index, but they approach it from different angles - the actual value of the index at the moment in the first sentence and the futures contracts speculating on the future value of the index in the second sentence. The introduction of Nasdaq futures in the second sentence further differentiates the content, resulting in a similarity rating of 2.5."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate \\"The police appeared again on the evening of January 16.\\" to Russian?","output":"\\"Полиция снова появилась вечером 16 января.\\" This translation conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, \\"The police appeared again on the evening of January 16,\\" into Russian. The sentence structure and grammar are adapted to the Russian language, which uses the Cyrillic alphabet. Here is a breakdown of the translation: 1. Полиция (politsiya) – This Russian word directly translates to \\"police\\" in English. In both languages, this word is a noun that refers to law enforcement officers who maintain order and prevent crime. 2. снова (snova) – This adverb means \\"again\\" in English, indicating that the police had appeared previously and returned on the specified date. 3. появилась (poyavilas) – This verb derives from the Russian verb \\"появиться\\" (poyavit'sya) and is translated as \\"appeared\\" in English. The verb uses the feminine past tense form to agree with the noun (_politsiya_), since it is considered feminine in Russian grammar. 4. вечером (vecherom) – This adverb describes the timing of the police appearance as \\"on the evening\\" in English. The Russian language utilizes the instrumental case to indicate when something occurs. 5. 16 (шестнадцатое) (shestnadtsatoye) – This represents the numeral 16 in Russian, written in ordinal form. In the context of the sentence, this refers to the date, January 16. 6. января (yanvarya) – This is the Russian word for \\"January,\\" the first month of the year. The genitive case is used in Russian to clarify the date. In conclusion, the translation \\"Полиция снова появилась вечером 16 января\\" effectively mirrors the English sentence \\"The police appeared again on the evening of January 16\\" while adhering to Russian grammar and syntax rules."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Waste of time Review: Game has average graphics (I've seen better though), but that's about it.

Write a question about the following article: During the 9th century, Norway was divided between several local kings controlling their own fiefdoms. By the end of the century, King Harald Fairhair  managed, mainly due to the military superiority gained by his alliance with Sigurd Ladejarl of Nidaros, to subjugate these mini-kingdoms, and he created a unified Norwegian state. This alliance came apart after Harald's death. The jarls of Lade and various descendants of Harald Fairhair would spend the next century interlocked in feuds over power. As well as power politics, religion also played a part in these conflicts, as two of the descendants of Harald Fairhair, Hakon the Good and Olaf Tryggvason attempted to convert the then heathen Norwegians to Christianity. In the year 1000, Svein  and Erik  of Lade took control over Norway, being supported by the Danish King Svein. In 1015, Olaf Haraldsson, representing the descendants of Harald Fairhair, returned from one of his Viking trips and was immediately elected as King of Norway.  In June 1016, he won the Battle at Nesjar against the Jarls of Lade. Olav Haraldsson's success in becoming King of Norway was helped by the Danes being kept occupied with the ongoing fighting in England. In the year 1028, the Danish King Cnut the Great made an alliance with the Lades, and Olaf had to go into exile in Kievan Rus . In the year of 1029 the last Lade, Hakon Jarl, drowned and Olaf returned to Norway with his army to regain his throne and the Kingdom of Norway.","output":"In what ways did the alliance between King Harald Fairhair and Sigurd Ladejarl contribute to the unification of Norway in the 9th century, and how did religion play a role in conflicts among their descendants?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a January 2010 interview with NME she spoke of being inspired by the film Food, Inc. and described the album as being about \\"exploring our faults and flaws\\" and being proud of them. The closing track, \\"Space\\", which was reportedly recorded using an iPhone app, is a ballad which Mikael Wood, writing in Billboard, described as \\"dreamy\\" and \\"sound[ing] like a Sega Genesis practicing its pillow talk\\". In contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described \\"Lovalot\\" as sounding \\"like it was recorded in a dank alley, the singer's voice reverberating amid percussion that sounds like doors creaking and rats scurrying across garbage cans\\".  \\"XXXO\\" draws its inspiration from M.I.A.'s \\"cheesy pop side\\", and is based on the theme of the creation of a sex symbol. \\"Teqkilla\\" is the only track to address her relationship with Bronfman, through a reference to Seagram, the company owned by his family.  \\"It Takes a Muscle\\" is a cover version of a track originally recorded in 1982 by Dutch group Spectral Display, and is performed in a reggae style.The opening track \\"The Message\\", featuring a male lead vocalist, parodies the words of the traditional song \\"Dem Bones\\" to link Google to \\"the government\\".

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which plans to appeal , was given until May 28 to restore the old subway and bus fare and the old commuter railroad rates .","output":"I will now examine both sentences to determine if they have the same meaning. Sentence 1: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority was given two weeks to restore the  1.50 fare and the old commuter railroad rates, York declared. Sentence 2: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which plans to appeal, was given until May 28 to restore the old subway and bus fare and the old commuter railroad rates. Step 1: Identify the subject Both sentences have the same subject: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Step 2: Identify the actions/verbs In both sentences, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was given a deadline to restore fares and commuter rates. Step 3: Compare deadlines Sentence 1 states the MTA was given \\"two weeks\\" to restore the fares and rates. Sentence 2 states the MTA was given \\"until May 28\\" to restore the fares and rates. Step 4: Compare the fares and rates to be restored Sentence 1 specifies these changes to be the \\"1.50 fare and the old commuter railroad rates.\\" Sentence 2 specifies these changes to be the \\"old subway and bus fare and the old commuter railroad rates.\\" Step 5: Identify any additional information Sentence 1: \\"York declared\\" - This tells us who provided the statement.

So how can I get meth to be flush out of body in 2 hours before a urine drug test? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Hi there! I understand you have questions about getting meth out of your system. I'll do my best to explain this simply. First of all, it's important to remember that taking drugs can be harmful, and it's always better to avoid using them in the first place. Now, about your questions, they are about the same thing, like two friends asking how to clean a dirty shirt quickly. Both questions want to know how to remove something - in this case, meth - from the body. But the second question asks about doing it in 2 hours, while the first question doesn't say how quickly. The thing is, time helps our body clean itself, just like how water and soap help us clean that dirty shirt. Meth can stay in the body for different times for different people, but it usually takes at least a few days to get naturally cleaned up. So, unfortunately, there isn't a safe and sure way to get meth out of your system in such a short time.

Decide if you need to do it again with a negative result. Confirm a positive result with a doctor. Article:","output":"Title: Understanding Home Pregnancy Tests: When to Take One, Interpret Results, and Confirm with a Doctor Introduction Home pregnancy tests have become the go-to option for women seeking to confirm a possible pregnancy. Easy to use, affordable, and accessible, these tests can provide an accurate response in just a few minutes.  In this article, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of taking a home pregnancy test, determining if you need to take a second test due to a negative result, and finally, confirming a positive result with a healthcare professional. Step 1: Take a Home Pregnancy Test The first step in confirming a potential pregnancy is to take a home pregnancy test. Here's how to do it accurately: 1. Choose a reliable brand: When selecting a pregnancy test, opt for a well-known brand that has been trusted by many. This way, you can increase the accuracy of your results.  2. Read the instructions: Before using the test, make sure to read the instructions carefully. Each brand might have slightly different testing methods. 3. Timing is crucial: The best time to take a pregnancy test is one week after your missed period, as the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is present in higher levels in your urine during this time. 4. Use the first urine of the day: For the most accurate results, it is recommended to use the first urine sample of the day, as hCG concentration will be the highest. 5. Place the test on a flat surface, and wait for the recommended time (usually around 3-5 minutes) to read the results. Step 2: Analyzing the Results: Negative Test and Re-testing If the test comes back negative, there are a couple of factors to consider before deciding whether or not to take a second test: 1. Timing: As previously mentioned, timing is crucial when it comes to taking a pregnancy test. If you took the test too early, it might not have detected the hCG hormone leading to a negative result. In this case, it is recommended to wait a few days and take another test. 2. Test Sensitivity: Different tests have varying degrees of sensitivity when it comes to detecting hCG. If you doubt the accuracy of the first test, consider choosing one with a higher sensitivity and re-testing. Remember that while a negative result can bring relief or disappointment, it is essential to make an informed decision about re-testing based on the factors above. Step 3: Confirming a Positive Result with a Doctor Receiving a positive result can be exciting and overwhelming. To ensure the accuracy of the home pregnancy test and initiate proper prenatal care, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional. Here are the steps to follow: 1. Schedule an appointment: Upon receiving a positive result, contact your healthcare provider to schedule a prenatal appointment. 2. Blood test: A healthcare professional will perform a blood test to confirm the presence of the hCG hormone, providing a more definitive result compared to a home pregnancy test. 3. Ultrasound: If the blood test comes back positive, an ultrasound may be scheduled to confirm the pregnancy further and determine the gestational age. In conclusion, taking a home pregnancy test can be a crucial first step in confirming a potential pregnancy. By following the guidelines outlined in this article and consulting with a healthcare professional, you can ensure the accuracy of your results and embark on your pregnancy journey with confidence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Take a few moments every day, and just pause. Sweep your gaze over your field of vision. Try to notice as many details as possible. This will train you to pay more attention to your surroundings.  Pay attention to the people, objects, animals, plants, and buildings around you. Try doing this in a different place every day. Start at home, then try it at an office, park, mall, grocery store, or a local landmark. Often, people only notice the large objects that surround them. As you go throughout your day, try to look for the smaller details that might surround buildings, landmarks, and large spaces.  For example, you might be at a store. What does the sign say? Is there anything on the windows? How many carts are lined up outside? If you're walking through a neighborhood, you might study the different mailboxes, lawn ornaments, plants, or toys out in the yard. It is easy to become distracted by electronics, intrusive thoughts, or noisy environments, but these can make you less observant. Rather than tune out your surroundings, try to focus on where you are in the moment.  Instead of listening to music on your commute, describe your surroundings. On the bus, you might notice that there are five people on it, that the bus is making a rumbling noise, and that there is a musty smell. When you take a walk, listen to the sounds of nature, such as birds singing or the wind rustling through the trees. Think about how the sun feels on your skin or how brightly colored the flowers are. Do this throughout your day as you notice things. This will keep you observant in the moment. Write your observations in a journal or word document. Try to be as specific as possible.  What did you see? Was it a certain color, size, or shape? Where was the object? How it was placed in relation to other objects? What kinds of sounds were going on around you? What types of sensations did you feel? Who was there? What were they wearing? What were they doing? When you're trying to observe something, try to identify how many of them there are. These numbers will force to you to pay more attention to the size or quantity of objects. As time goes on, you may be able to count objects more quickly.  For example, instead of “I saw some kids playing outside,” you might write, “I saw four kids playing outside with one ball.” Instead of saying \\"I had to sign a bunch of documents,\\" keep track of what you did. You might observe that you signed your name four different times on two different documents. Summary:","output":"To become more observant, practice pausing and looking at your surroundings, noticing as many details as possible. Pay attention to people, objects, plants, and everything around you in different places. Focus on the small details and avoid distractions. Instead of listening to music, describe your surroundings and notice sounds and feelings. Write down your observations, and try to be specific. Practice counting objects to help you pay more attention to them. Doing this will help you become more observant over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

We were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food, the attentiveness of the staff, and the warm, inviting ambiance of the restaurant. It truly was a remarkable dining experience that deserves every bit of praise it gets. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with a charming setting that immediately felt welcoming and cozy. The soft lighting, tastefully decorated interior, and the gentle music in the background offered a perfect atmosphere for a romantic evening. One of the things that stood out to us was the exquisite menu. The Garden Bistro offers a great variety of dishes to choose from, including mouth-watering appetizers, main courses, and heavenly desserts. As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to see the extensive plant-based options available. It was clear that the chefs at the restaurant go above and beyond to ensure fresh, local ingredients are used in every dish. For our starters, we ordered the famous Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms and Truffled Cauliflower Soup. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection, filled with a rich and creamy blend of goat cheese and spinach. The soup, meanwhile, offered a delicate balance of flavors, with the truffle oil providing an elegant touch that left us craving for more. As for our main courses, I went with the Wild Mushroom Risotto, while my partner opted for the Seared Ahi Tuna. My risotto was creamy and bursting with the rich umami flavors of the wild mushrooms. The addition of asparagus and fragrant Parmesan cheese elevated the dish to a whole new level. My partner's Ahi Tuna was seared to perfection, creating a beautiful crust around the tender, flavorful fish. The accompanying Mango Salsa and Ginger Soy Glaze complemented the dish wonderfully, rounding out the Asian-inspired flavors. Finally, we couldn't resist indulging in one of their signature desserts, the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake. The cake was moist, warm, and gooey, with a decadent molten chocolate center that oozed out upon breaking through the delicate crust. Paired with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream, it was the perfect ending to our unforgettable meal. Throughout our evening at The Garden Bistro, the service was top-notch. The staff were attentive without being intrusive, and our server was genuinely friendly, offering helpful recommendations and ensuring our glasses were never empty. It's rare to find such a combination of outstanding food, ambiance, and service these days. In conclusion, our experience at The Garden Bistro was nothing short of exceptional.

Can you tell me the answer to when did free primary education start in kenya??","output":"Free primary education in Kenya began in January 2003 when the Kenyan government, under the leadership of President Mwai Kibaki, introduced the Free Primary Education (FPE) policy. This policy aimed to alleviate the financial burden of education on families, improve access to basic education, increase enrollment rates, and reduce inequality among different socio-economic classes and regions. Kenya's education system before the Free Primary Education policy was characterized by low enrollment rates, high dropouts, and a considerable disparity in access to education based on factors such as socio-economic status, gender, and location. Education was not affordable for a significant portion of the population, and many children were either not attending school or forced to drop out due to financial constraints. The introduction of the FPE policy was a significant milestone in Kenya's education sector as it abolished tuition fees for primary education and allocated funding to primary schools based on student enrollment. This increased public spending on education by the Kenyan government, which was intended to help schools cover the cost of textbooks, teachers, and other essential resources required to provide a basic education. The implementation of the Free Primary Education policy led to a drastic increase in enrollment rates across the country. According to data from the World Bank, the net enrollment rate in primary education rose from 61.6 % in 2000 to about 95 % in 2004. This corresponds to an additional 1.2 million children enrolling in primary education within two years of the policy's introduction. While the introduction of free primary education in Kenya has significantly increased enrollment rates, the policy has also faced several challenges. These include inadequate infrastructure, a shortage of teachers, a lack of learning materials, and an increased demand for secondary education as more students complete primary education. Moreover, issues such as regional disparities and gender inequality still persist in Kenya's educational sector. In conclusion, free primary education in Kenya started in January 2003 as an essential policy intervention to improve access to basic education, increase enrollment, and address socio-economic disparities in the country. While it has had a noteworthy impact on primary school enrollment, various challenges remain, requiring further efforts to ensure equitable, quality education for all Kenyan children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:","output":"Title: Lewandowski's Double Sends Bayern Munich Soaring into the German Cup Semi-Finals Introduction: Bayern Munich secured their place in the German Cup semi-finals with a commanding victory over 10-man Bochum, courtesy of a brace from star striker Robert Lewandowski. The reigning champions continued their pursuit of a record-extending 21st cup triumph, as they edged closer to yet another domestic double. Match Overview: In a match that displayed the full breadth of Bayern's attacking prowess, Lewandowski gave fans plenty to cheer about with his superb finishing. The Polish international opened the scoring for the visitors with a well-taken header in the first half, and later doubled his tally with a stunning volley. The hosts, Bochum, entered the game as substantial underdogs, and their uphill battle was made all the more difficult following an early sending off. Bochum's rocky journey throughout the match was ultimately compounded by Lewandowski's clinical expertise. Game-Changing Moment: The pivotal moment of the match came in the 20th minute when Bochum's defender was shown a straight red card for a challenge deemed dangerous by the referee. With the home side down to 10 men and facing relentless pressure from Bayern's attack, the chances of a miraculous upset quickly faded away. Lewandowski took full advantage of the situation, and just a few minutes after the red card, he rose highest to head home a pin-point cross from Kingsley Coman. The goal marked the beginning of an unstoppable performance from the 33-year-old forward. Adding Insult to Injury: Looking to compound Bochum's misery, Lewandowski put the result beyond doubt in the second half with an exquisite volley. The striker's second goal showcased his uncanny ability to find the net from seemingly any angle. The goal effectively snuffed out any hopes of a late comeback, ensuring that Bayern Munich comfortably advanced to the following round of the competition. Bochum's valiant effort in a challenging game, although admirable, proved insufficient against the reigning champions. Looking Ahead: With this victory, Bayern Munich solidified their position as the team to beat in the German Cup. Their eyes are firmly set on another domestic double, as they also attempt to maintain their lead at the top of the Bundesliga table. Meanwhile, Bochum will hope to use this experience to strengthen and develop their squad, looking to put in strong performances in their upcoming domestic league games. Conclusion: Bayern Munich's dominance in the German Cup continued, as Robert Lewandowski's deadly double guided them to a commanding victory against a 10-man Bochum side. With the semi-finals on the horizon, fans and pundits alike eagerly anticipate the draw to find out who will challenge the reigning champions en route to the coveted cup. The pursuit of a record-extending 21st German Cup triumph remains well within the Bavarians' reach, as they continue to stamp their authority on domestic football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Greenland Sea is often defined as part of the Arctic Ocean, sometimes as part of the Atlantic Ocean. However, definitions of the Arctic Ocean and its seas tend to be imprecise or arbitrary. In general usage the term \\"Arctic Ocean\\" would exclude the Greenland Sea. In oceanographic studies the Greenland Sea is considered part of the Nordic Seas, along with the Norwegian Sea. The Nordic Seas are the main connection between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and, as such, could be of great significance in a possible shutdown of thermohaline circulation. In oceanography the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas are often referred to collectively as the \\"Arctic Mediterranean Sea\\", a marginal sea of the Atlantic.  - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state. Norway's coastline is estimated at with fjords, but only when fjords are excluded.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, also known as the Arctic Archipelago, is a group of islands north of the Canadian mainland.  - Liverpool Land is a peninsula in eastern Greenland. Geography. The peninsula is bounded by Scoresby Sund in the south, \\"Carlsberg Fjord\\" in the northwest, \\"Kangerterajiva\\" (Hurry Inlet) in the southwest, the Greenland Sea in the east, and Jameson Land in the west. It was named by William Scoresby, who thought that Hurry Inlet had a confluence with Carlsberg Fjord, separating Liverpool Land from Jameson Land. The fjord-rich peninsula is long from Kap Greville in the north to Uunarteq in the south, up to wide, and measures about in area. It is connected to Jameson Land over a length of .   - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - The Danish Realm is a realm comprising Denmark proper, The Faroe Islands and Greenland.   - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - Global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming. Although the increase of near-surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in the popular press, most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over tens to thousands of years.  - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places.  - Inuit (pronounced or ; Inuktitut: , \\"the people\\") are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska. Inuit is a plural noun; the singular is Inuk. The oral Inuit languages are classified in the Eskimo-Aleut family. Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate spoken in Nunavut.  - Uunartoq Qeqertaq , Greenlandic for \`\` The Warming Island '' , is an island , that was only acknowledged as such in September 2005 , by an American explorer Dennis Schmitt , off the east central coast of Greenland , 550 km ( 340 mi ) north of the Arctic Circle . It was attached to the mainland of Liverpool Land by glacial ice even in 2002 , when the ice shelves began retreating rapidly in this area , so that by 2005 it was no longer attached to the mainland . Members of the scientific community believe this newly discovered island is a direct result of global warming . The island has three large peninsulas , and thus resembles the letter W.  - Jameson Land is a peninsula in eastern Greenland.  Geography. Jameson Land is bounded to the southwest by Scoresby Sound (the world's largest fjord), to the northwest by the Stauning Alps, to the north by Scoresby Land, to the northeast by the Fleming Fjord and the Nathorst Fjord of the Greenland Sea, and to the east by Carlsberg Fjord, the smaller Liverpool Land peninsula branching off, and Hurry Inlet.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Q: LucÃ­a (Paz Vega), a waitress, is talking on the phone with her depressed writer boyfriend Lorenzo (TristÃ¡n Ulloa) after they had a nasty argument, where, afterward, she walked out. Since he's been in a 'funk' for a while, she's worried, and goes home to console him. Finding an empty apartment, LucÃ­a is frantic. She receives a phone call from the police while finding a suicide note, and is so afraid of bad news that she hangs up, assuming the worst. They call back, but she ignores the ringing phone, packs a bag, and flees. Looking for a new beginning, LucÃ­a travels to the mysterious Balearic Islands that Lorenzo had always talked of, but had recently been very negative about.The plot breaks to six years earlier: Lorenzo is having casual sex in the ocean, on a bright moon-lit night, with a beautiful married woman he just met named Elena. They part ways, expecting to never see each other again. She discovers she is pregnant with his child, and attempts to find him, but, not knowing much about him, is unable to.Later, as Lorenzo talks with his literary agent at a restaurant, discussing his writer's block, LucÃ­a catches his attention as he gets up from his table to get cigarettes. She asks to speak to him and he joins her. She brazenly tells him that ever since she read his latest book, she has been following him and has fallen passionately in love with him. A smitten Lorenzo immediately engages the sexy, passionate LucÃ­a and she moves into Lorenzo's apartment.The film then interweaves the past and present, of the characters in the film, and the characters in Lorenzo's novel.Lorenzo repeatedly stalls for time on his new book with his editor, while his relationship with LucÃ­a deepens. About six years pass. Lorenzo learns he has a daughter as a result of his encounter with Elena and begins to visit the child at her school, meeting her babysitter BelÃ©n. BelÃ©n tells Lorenzo her mother is a recently retired porn actress with a new hot boyfriend, and virtually seduces Lorenzo with chatter of sexual context and banter about her fantasies. Lorenzo uses these encounters and his fantasies about BelÃ©n and her mother as content for his book, and LucÃ­a reads about it, thinking it fiction. Meanwhile, he does not disclose his fatherhood to LucÃ­a or the child, nor even attempt to contact Elena.BelÃ©n flirts with Lorenzo and eventually invites him over to Elena's house while she babysits his daughter, Luna. Lorenzo tells Luna a bedtime story, and after she falls asleep, he and BelÃ©n begin to have sex. They are interrupted as Luna knocks at the bedroom door, and they watch in horror as the family dog, a large Rotweiler in 'protect mode' kills Luna. BelÃ©n is stunned. Lorenzo runs away and falls into a deep depression.Lorenzo's writing turns dark, towards depraved sex and death. He anonymously contacts Elena, who has moved to the island to find solace and recall better days, and provides her a nice story about a beautiful child that loves to swim in the sea, to cheer her spirits. But his now guilt-ridden and uncommunicative relationship with LucÃ­a begins to collapse.Back in the present, LucÃ­a meets a scuba diver on the island, Carlos, and through him, Elena, who runs an inn on the island. LucÃ­a rents a room, and the women bond as friends, not knowing their intimate connection. But when LucÃ­a mentions Lorenzo by name, and his past visit to the island long ago, Elena deduces the connection. LucÃ­a sees a picture of Luna (looking remarkably like her father and remembering the name from Lorenzo's novel) and she makes the connection too.Lorenzo's editor visits Lorenzo in the hospital, where he was taken after being in an 'accident', spending several weeks in recovery. When Lorenzo asks about LucÃ­a, the editor tells Lorenzo he thinks LucÃ­a thinks he is dead. Lorenzo guesses LucÃ­a is on the island and has the editor take him there. After both women discover that Lorenzo isn't dead, the three characters cope with and finally understand the entanglements of their interwoven relationships., Question: The film is based on whose novel?

'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work.

I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

Article: In general, people talk about two groups of colours warm colours and cool colours. Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that red, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue and violet are cool. Perhaps warm colours remind people of warm days and the cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Where would you find a mom looking for an injured child to come home with her?\\"  Context: \\"On Children's Day, June 1, 2008, many parents went to the rubble of schools to mourn for their children. The surviving children, who were mostly living in relief centres, performed ceremonies marking the special day, but also acknowledging the earthquake.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context of the tragic aftermath of an earthquake, particularly the one mentioned on Children's Day, June 1, 2008, a mother looking for her injured child to come home with her would likely be found in several key locations. These locations include relief centers, hospitals, temporary shelters, makeshift medical facilities, and the rubble of the schools and surrounding areas. Each of these locations possesses specific relevance to the situation and the desperate search for a missing or injured child. 1. Relief centers: Relief centers are usually set up in the wake of natural disasters like earthquakes, providing essential aid and support to the affected individuals and families. These centers often comprise temporary shelters, food and water, and medical assistance. A mother searching for her injured child may be at a relief center in hopes of reuniting with her child, who might be receiving care, supplies, or simply locating surviving family members. 2. Hospitals: It is likely that injured children would be taken to nearby hospitals, clinics, or makeshift medical facilities for treatment after such a catastrophic event. A mother looking for her injured child could be visiting these hospitals, going from one emergency department to another, inquiring and searching every ward, to find her child. Hospitals are an obvious location for a mother searching for her injured child to come home with her, as she would expect them to be receiving medical care or treatment. 3. Temporary shelters: These shelters are often set up in the aftermath of natural disasters to offer immediate accommodation to the displaced population. A mother searching for her injured child may visit temporary shelters in search of her child, hoping that they might have found temporary refuge in one of these shelters, or asking other people in the shelter if they had seen her child. 4. Makeshift medical facilities: In the aftermath of a large-scale disaster, local hospitals may become overwhelmed, necessitating the establishment of makeshift medical facilities to handle the increased demand for medical assistance. These facilities may be set up close to the epicenter of the tragedy, like in this case, the schools, where many children were buried beneath the rubble. A mother searching for her injured child might visit these makeshift medical facilities, frantically enquiring if her child was found and being treated there. 5. Rubble of the schools and surrounding areas: Lastly, a mother looking for her injured child might be physically searching the debris and rubble of the schools and areas impacted by the earthquake. With a heavy heart and determination, these mothers could be spotted scouring the remnants of the buildings and structures, sifting through the wreckage in search of any sign of their missing or injured children. Some parents would go to the rubble to mourn their children who lost their lives in the tragedy, while others cling to the hope of finding their child alive or recovering their remains. In conclusion, a mother searching for her injured child to come home would be primarily found in relief centers, hospitals, temporary shelters, makeshift medical facilities, and the rubble of the schools and surrounding areas in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake like the one that occurred on Children's Day, June 1, 2008. The circumstances surrounding this terrible event highlight the tenacity, love, and determination of parents searching for their missing or injured children in the face of unimaginable adversity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The authorities have decided that the safety and well-being of all involved, including players and staff, can no longer be guaranteed amidst the escalating incidents of violence and disorder. Onlookers and loyal fans have witnessed the gradual deterioration of the stadium's atmosphere over the past few months. Tensions were already simmering between rival fan groups, leading to minor scuffles and verbal altercations during matches. But in the last few weeks, things have taken a drastic turn for the worse. It began as a series of isolated clashes between supporters, with tensions soon boiling over to create a hostile and dangerous environment at the Sevilla Stadium. Disgruntled fans from opposing teams have been engaging in large-scale brawls and hurling projectiles at each other. Disturbingly, some have even taken to vandalizing the stadium itself, inflicting significant damage to its infrastructure. The authorities and stadium management have been working tirelessly to de-escalate the situation. Enhanced security measures were implemented, and periodic public announcements were made, pleading with fans to behave responsibly. Unfortunately, these interventions failed to make a positive impact, with incidents continuing to occur with alarming regularity. The final straw came during the latest match, where an all-out brawl between fans broke out in the stands, leaving several people injured. As emergency services struggled to reach the injured spectators, the match was abandoned, and the stadium was evacuated. This shocking and chaotic event has confirmed the need for decisive action by the authorities. As a result, the decision to temporarily close the Sevilla Stadium has been made. The closure of the Sevilla Stadium comes with a heavy heart, as it represents a significant loss to the community and the world of football. Historically, the stadium has been a place of pride and unity, where fans gathered to support their favorite teams and revel in the excitement of the beautiful game. Sadly, recent events have sullied these fond memories, necessitating decisive action to restore order and ensure public safety. During the stadium's closure, the authorities will carry out investigations into the root causes of the crowd trouble, and further punitive actions may be taken against the responsible parties. The stadium's management will also be investing in extensive repairs and improvements to the facilities, ensuring that all safety regulations and guidelines are met. In the meantime, the affected teams will need to seek alternative venues for their matches, placing strain on the scheduling and logistics of the competition. It is hoped that these temporary measures will serve as a reminder of the values of sportsmanship and community spirit, and that the Sevilla Stadium can soon return to being the beloved heart of football in the region. The onus is now on football clubs, governing bodies, and fans themselves to come together in addressing the issue of crowd trouble at matches. A collaborative effort is needed to tackle not just the immediate security concerns but also the underlying societal issues that may contribute to such violent behavior. It is essential that necessary steps are taken to restore the peace, not just in Sevilla but in stadiums across the world, so that future generations can continue to enjoy the enthralling spectacle of football in a safe and enriching environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step-by-step justification of translation: 1. I started by identifying key terms and phrases in the original text and determined their Finnish translations:    - Member States = jäsenvaltiot    - broad union = laaja unioni    - facilitate = helpottaa    - smooth running = sujuva toiminta    - internal market = sisämarkkinat    - bound together = yhteen sidottuja    - strong economic force = vahvana taloudellisena voimana    - considerable economic output = merkittävä taloudellinen tuotanto    - global trade = maailmankauppa    - global GNP = maailman BKT 2. I then formed the sentences, making sure that the Finnish grammar and sentence structure are correct and that the translated phrases fit naturally. 3. I made some adjustments to ensure that the Finnish translation is coherent and fluent:    - Instead of using a direct translation of \\"with\\" (kanssa) at the beginning of the sentence, I moved it after \\"11 jäsenvaltion\\" to form \\"11 jäsenvaltion kanssa\\" which flows better in Finnish.    - Changed \\"are bound together\\" to \\"ovat yhteen sidottuja\\", which is a more accurate and natural translation in Finnish.    - Used the percentage symbols (%) instead of writing them out as words for global trade and GNP, as it is more common and succinct. 4.

Robert and Justin are both patients in the hospital who are suffering complications from their HIV infections. The doctor is trying to get information from both men about their diseases so he can create customized treatment plans for both men. After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who will develop infections more frequently?  Hint: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Robert, who has been infected with HIV for many years, will likely develop infections more frequently. This is because the number of T cells, which are integral to the immune system's ability to defend the body, typically declines over time following the initial HIV infection. Since Robert's infection has been longer in duration compared to Justin's, it can be inferred that his T cell count might be lower, thus making him more susceptible to frequent infections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

More commonly known as Free Quakers, the Society was founded by members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, who had been expelled for failure to adhere to the Peace Testimony during the American Revolutionary War. Many of its early members were prominent Quakers involved in the American Revolution before the society was established. Notable Free Quakers at the early meetings include Lydia Darragh and Betsy Ross.

It turns out that Owen is actually a priest sent by the Vatican to get a blood sample from a possessed girl named Tristana Medeiros, the same attacker from the end of the previous film. At the penthouse, Tristana is nowhere to be found. Larra, one of the GEO operators, finds a sample of her blood â the only one that the original priest took from her. Owen performs a religious rite, and the blood combusts, confirming that it is the blood he's looking for; however, Fernandez, commanding officer of the GEO team drops it, rendering it useless. Owen tells them that they must get a blood sample from Tristana herself. Jennifer's father, who was outside getting medicine for his daughter (the infected Jennifer from the first installment), manages to convince a firefighter to take him into the building. Three teenagers, Tito, Mire and Ori gain access to the building through the sewage system; however, police seal their exit. After the deaths of Larra, Jennifer's father, and the firefighter from attacks by the possessed, the two groups find each other. However, Tito has been bitten, and they restrain him and lock Mire and Ori in a room where their fates are left unknown. The group then finds Ãngela Vidal (Manuela Velasco), the reporter from REC, who still has her camera with her. Owen forces Tito to tell him where Tristana Medeiros is. The demon possessing Tito tells him that she is \\"in the highest.\\" Owen figures out that this means that she is in the penthouse. The demon then gives a hint that the \\"light\\" blinds them from seeing the path. When Ãngela is asked how she saw Tristana, she says she saw her through the camera's night vision.

He hitchhikes to his childhood home, a decrepit place now owned by Jeremiah. Run down as it is, it is the dream home for Wes Merritt and his wife Louise. They are painstakingly saving up the money to buy it from Wes's meager wages as a cowhand. Wes recognizes Jeff as a once-prominent rodeo rider, and introduces himself, then helps Jeff gets a job at the same ranch. Wes has competed in some local rodeos, but has the ambition to do more, and wants Jeff to help him improve his skills. Wes enters a local rodeo behind his wife's back. When he does well, he decides to join the rodeo circuit, with Jeff as his partner and trainer. Louise is wholeheartedly against the idea, but goes along. She makes her husband promise to quit once they have saved enough for the house. As Louise becomes acquainted with rodeo life, she becomes more and more disenchanted.

Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.\\" He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.

The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie). Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Skinny Puppy is noted for theatrical and controversial live performances which blend performance art with music, especially in an ambitious period that spanned their Head Trauma (1987-1988), VIVIsectVI (1988), Too Dark Park (1990), and Last Rights (1992) tours. Ogre has been critical of the bands early performances, telling Spin magazine in 1992 that \\"I would do things on stage that would blow-they just wouldn't work\\". Live performances involved periods of musical improvisation, film projections, and elaborate stage props and machines, many of which are designed and built by Ogre himself. While discussing Skinny Puppy's performances, Ogre once remarked that \\"our shows combine images with theater. It works better than just coming out and doing a horror magic routine\\".  On-stage theatrics included Ogre being suspended from racks and cables, play with a hangman's noose, Key cutting steel with an angle grinder, and mock executions of Ogre and George H.W. Bush. Following the 2004 Presidential Election in the United States, promoters began to ask the band to refrain from using fake blood during their performances. This reaction was prompted by the performance of a mock execution on stage, during which Ogre was decapitated by actors dressed as then U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. The band was also asked by Samsung (who had been asked by Ogre to sponsor the band with a large flat screen) to \\"not insult the president\\" while performing on stage. In a 1987 television interview with Kim Clarke Champniss, Key explained that while Ogre follows a \\"rough guideline\\" during a live performance, a majority of his on-stage theatrics are thought up of spontaneously. Key told Champniss that Ogre's demeanor on stage could \\"range from just a sort of laid back kind of lurking to a rampant psycho\\". Ogre once remarked that touring was, for himself, like \\"dating hydrogen peroxide\\", referencing the numerous injuries which he would acquire over the course of touring.  Though Ogre and Key have remained the only constant members of Skinny Puppy's live act since the death of Dwayne Goettel, several other musicians have been hired to accompany the pair since 2004. They include drummer Justin Bennett, guitarist William Morrison, and guitarist Matthew Setzer. Entity:","output":"Skinny Puppy"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: In more than 15 years on the bench, Orange County Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly said, he had never run into a case like the 19-year-old child molester facing a minimum 25-year prison term.            A jury had convicted Kevin Rojano-Nieto of sodomizing a 3-year-old girl who had wandered into a garage where he was playing video games, and the judge conceded the crime was despicable.            But Kelly said he wrestled with the case and finally decided that giving Rojano-Nieto such a sentence — even though it was the mandatory minimum sentence under state law — would be \\"cruel and unusual punishment.\\"            So he gave him 10 years instead.            The judge's decision has landed him at the center of a growing firestorm. On Thursday, three Orange County supervisors called on him to resign, thousands signed petitions condemning his actions and conservative talk show hosts revised their programming to discuss the case and news blog.            Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, meanwhile, said he plans to appeal the sentencing.            More than 50,000 names have so far been added to a Change.org petition calling for his resignation, and a Facebook page titled Remove Judge M. Marc Kelly From the Bench page had thousands of likes.            \\"He must have forgotten that his job is to protect the victim, not the perpetrator,\\" Supervisor Lisa Bartlett said at a Thursday afternoon news conference, describing the decision as \\"an unconscionable ruling\\" by an \\"activist judge.\\"            News of the reduced sentence caused other victims to remember their mistreatment at the hands of judges, said Patricia Wenskunas, founder and chief executive officer of Crime Survivors Inc.            \\"It is not right, it is not just, and we will not stand for it,\\" she said.            Gesturing toward the towering court building behind them, Supervisor Todd Spitzer said Kelly had overstepped the bounds required of Superior Court judges by making law instead of following it.            If Kelly does not resign, he said, the judge could be recalled.            Kelly, who declined to comment Thursday, said during Rojano-Nieto's sentencing that he saw the defendant as being \\"extremely remorseful\\" and that a prison term stretching a quarter of a century would be \\"grossly disproportionate,\\" according to court transcripts.            The judge said statements had shown that Rojano-Nieto was not a sexual predator but a confused young man raised in a fractured family.            The young man, he said, had \\"inexplicably became sexually aroused\\" when the girl wandered into the garage but never intended to harm the child, a relative. He said Rojano-Nieto did not fit the classic definition of a predator.            He also said the girl now \\"appears to be a happy healthy child.\\"            \\"So it's hard to gauge how this crime may affect her mental state in the future,\\" he said. \\"It certainly may, but I hope it does not. It doesn't appear she suffered any serious violent physical injuries, and by all accounts she appears headed for a normal life.\\"            At the time of the crime, Rojano-Nieto was working as a grocery store bagger and lived in a Santa Ana home with at least five other children, according to court documents. A high school graduate, he told the court he had aspirations of joining the military.            \\"It has been not only extremely difficult, but utterly devastating for me and my family to fully come to terms with the events that took place,\\" a relative of both the girl and defendant wrote in a statement that her husband read to the court during a hearing in February.            \\"It has rocked the very foundation of my family to the core.\\"            Rojano-Nieto, who is now 20, also spoke before he was sentenced.            \\"Despite my actions and what people might say about me, that is not what is in my heart. Regardless about what people say about me, that is not who I am.\\"            Times staff writer Veronica Rocha contributed to this report. ||||| [UPDATE 08/20/15 – OFFICIAL SIGNATURE GATHERING EVENT TO REMOVE JUDGE KELLY IS TODAY!!!

VISIT: HTTP://WWW.RECALLJUDGEMARCKELLY.COM]      A convicted child rapist didn't mean to hurt the toddler he sodomized. The rapist didn't commit an act of violence. The child rapist didn't callously disregard the three year old he anally raped. At least, that's what Judge M. Marc Kelly of Orange County Superior Court in California would have you believe.      On Friday, April 3rd, 2015, Judge Kelly used his judicial discretion to sentence convicted rapist Kevin Jonas Rojano to 10 years in prison for sodomizing a 3 year old female child. That is 15 years *less* than the mandatory minimum sentence for such a crime. He stated that imposing the mandatory sentence would amount to \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" for Rojano.      Judge Kelly felt that this particular child rapist deserved less of a sentence than other child rapists get. He is quoted as saying this: \\"Although serious and despicable, this does not compare to a situation where a pedophilic child predator preys on an innocent child.\\" He further stated, \\"there was no violence or callous disregard for (the victim's) well-being.\\"      Judge Kelly continued, \\"In looking at the facts of Mr. Rojano’s case, the manner in which this offense was committed is not typical of a predatory, violent brutal sodomy of a child case.\\"      Judge Kelly further showed empathy with the rapist in this case by stating, \\"Mr. Rojano did not seek out or stalk (the victim). He was playing video games and she wandered into the garage. He inexplicably became sexually aroused but did not appear to consciously intend to harm (the victim) when he sexually assaulted her.\\" He added that the rapist \\"almost immediately\\" stopped his actions and \\"realized the wrongfulness of his act.\\"      Judge Kelly made these remarks knowing the 3 year old girl suffered tissue injuries to her anus as a result of the sodomy she endured. He also made these comments knowing Rojano covered the little girl's mouth to remain undetected while her mother frantically looked for her.      ... Something must be done ...      Despite Judge Kelly's statements, *any* rape is violent, and imposing such a light sentence on the perpetrator of this violent act is itself a callous disregard for the victim.      Despite Judge Kelly's statements, the sodomy of a 3 year old girl is predatory, brutal, and violent in its very nature, and any circumstances surrounding the action do not change this fact.      Despite Judge Kelly's statements, \\"almost immediately\\" stopping is little too late for the helpless victim, who was raped the moment she was penetrated by Rojano.      Judge Kelly's statements are nothing short of reprehensible. It is clear that Judge Kelly's empathy towards the perpetrator of this horrific crime has clouded his judgment.      Mandatory minimum sentences are created for crimes deemed so heinous that any sentence less than the mandatory would be unjust. Judge Kelly has taken it upon himself to impose a sentence that is just that: unjust.      I call on Judge Kelly to do the right thing and step down from his official position OR FACE A RECALL.      I call on the State of California Commission on Judicial Performance to open an official inquiry into Judge Kelly's actions to determine what discipline may be necessary in light of his words and in light of the unjust sentence he imposed in this case.      What Judge Kelly has done has severely and permanently damaged any public trust in him. It calls into question whether he can impose any future judgments fairly, and it calls into question his past judgments.      [Update] Some Change.org readers have noted that this isn't the first time Judge Kelly has handed down a lenient sentence for a sex offense. In the prior instance, a California Highway Patrol officer was handed probation. (See http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-03-25/news/moxley-confidential-chp-stephen-deck/)      [Update] The US District Attorney's Office in Santa Ana, California has officially appealed the case!

Context: As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim. I hope they grow up and see just how strong their mother is and how she has worked in the community to raise awareness and help others. Question: How does the mom feel about the world? Options:  A.

A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting.  He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style. The \\"Palladian revival\\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio.

Santamental, released in October 2003, is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Steve Vai, and drummer Gregg Bissonette. When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, \\"But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record.\\"The musicians Lukather chose for Santamental, most of whom were involved in the hard-rock genre, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing. Vai provided guitar work for \\"Carol of the Bells\\" along with Lukather's son Trevor, then 14 years old. Slash, who recorded his part in one take, played on the Lukather/Stan Lynch composition \\"Broken Heart for Christmas\\". Lukather spoke highly of Slash after the project, calling him the \\"Keith Richards of our generation\\". Well-known session guitarist Michael Landau played on the song \\"Look Out For Angels\\", and there is a version of \\"Jingle Bells\\" featuring a big band and sung by Sammy Davis, Jr. Santamental was recorded in six days, after which Lukather proclaimed it \\"his first and last Christmas album\\".

Choose from: -unacceptable -acceptable","output":"A linguist would most likely rate the sentence \\"John sounded happy\\" as acceptable linguistically. Here is a detailed analysis of why this sentence is considered linguistically acceptable: 1. Syntax: The sentence follows the basic syntactic structure of subject-verb-object (SVO) that is typical for English sentences. In this case, \\"John\\" is the subject, \\"sounded\\" is the verb, and \\"happy\\" is the object. 2. Verb usage: The verb \\"sounded\\" is a linking verb which is used to describe properties and states of the subject rather than actions. It connects the subject, \\"John,\\" with additional information about him, which in this case is \\"happy.\\" The use of the verb in this sentence is correct. 3. Predicate: \\"Happy\\" is an adjective used as the predicate in this sentence. The purpose of a predicate is to provide more information about the subject. In this case, \\"happy\\" is used to describe John's emotional state. The use of the adjective as a predicate is grammatically correct and adds meaningful information to the sentence. 4. Clarity: The sentence is clear and concise, conveying a simple yet specific idea about John's emotional state. The meaning is easy to understand for speakers of English. 5. Punctuation: The sentence starts with a capital letter, as is appropriate for proper nouns like names, and ends with a period. This demonstrates correct punctuation use for a standard, declarative sentence in English. 6. Semantics: The sentence is semantically sound, as the words \\"John,\\" \\"sounded,\\" and \\"happy\\" are all used appropriately according to their meanings. Based on these factors, a linguist is likely to consider the sentence \\"John sounded happy\\" as linguistically acceptable. This judgement is made with the understanding that languages are dynamic, and there might be contextual or cultural variations that can affect acceptability, but generally, this sentence complies with the standard grammar and syntactic rules of the English language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

About 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.

Here is a news article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department announced a 5 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs over the sale of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.      The deal announced Monday resolves state and federal probes into the sale of shoddy mortgages before the housing bubble and economic meltdown.      It requires the bank to pay a 2.4 billion civil penalty and an additional 1.8 billion in relief to underwater homeowners and distressed borrowers, along with 875 million in other claims.      The agreement is the latest multi-billion-dollar civil settlement reached with a major bank. Other banks that settled in the last two years include Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co.      Goldman had previously disclosed the settlement in January, but federal officials laid out additional allegations in a statement of facts. ||||| (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has agreed to pay 5.06 billion to settle claims that it misled mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Monday.      The settlement, which Goldman disclosed in January, stems from the firm’s conduct in packaging, securitization, marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007, the Justice Department said.      Investors suffered billions of dollars in losses from the securities bought during the period, the department said.      The settlement comprises a 2.385 billion civil penalty and 1.8 billion in other relief, including funds for homeowners whose mortgages exceed the value of their property, as well as distressed borrowers. It also preserves the government’s ability to bring criminal charges against Goldman and does not release any individuals from potential criminal or civil liability, the Justice Department said.      In addition, Goldman will pay 875 million to resolve claims by the New York and Illinois attorneys general, the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago and Seattle.      A state and federal working group formed to investigate wrongdoing in the pre-financial crisis mortgage-backed securities market negotiated the settlement, said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.      The group has reached settlements with five other major financial institutions since 2012: J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM.N) (13 billion), Bank of America (BAC.N) (16.6 billion), Citibank (C.N) (7 billion) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) (3.2 billion).      “We are pleased to put these legacy matters behind us,” a Goldman spokesman said in a statement. “Since the financial crisis, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our culture, reinforce our commitment to our clients, and ensure our governance processes are robust,” he said.      Goldman also acknowledged a Justice Department statement of facts describing how the firm misled investors.      For example, Goldman’s due diligence for one issue of 2006 mortgage-backed securities showed that some of the loan pools reflected an “unusually high” percentage of loans with credit and compliance defects, the Department said.      Slideshow (4 Images)      “How do we know that we caught everything?” asked a Goldman committee tasked with reviewing and approving mortgage-backed securities, according to the Justice Department. “We don’t,” a Goldman manager said.      “Depends on what you mean by everything? Because of the limited sampling... we don’t catch everything,” another Goldman manager said.      Still, the committee approved the securities without requiring additional due diligence, said the Justice Department, which did not identify those involved. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The U.S. Department of Justice announced a 5 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs over the sale of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.

Some crop tops fall to just below the bra-line, while others stop right above the belly button. Longer crop tops can cover most of the belly and just leave a small strip of skin above your waistband.","output":"When considering how to wear crop tops, it is essential to choose a crop top length that best suits your personal style and body type. Crop tops come in various lengths, offering a multitude of options for pairing and coordinating with different wardrobe items. By taking your individual preferences into account, you will ensure you feel comfortable and fashionable in your chosen attire. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to effectively wear crop tops: 1. Know your body type: Understanding your body type will help you select a crop top length that flatters your figure. Apple-shaped or hourglass body types may prefer longer crop tops, while pear-shaped or athletic body types might look best in shorter styles. 2. Choose a crop top style: Crop tops come in various styles, including tank tops, short sleeve, long sleeve, and off-the-shoulder designs. Choose a style that complements your existing wardrobe and the outfits you plan to wear with your crop top. 3. Coordinate with high-waisted bottoms: Pairing a crop top with high-waisted bottoms, such as jeans, shorts, skirts, or leggings, will help elongate your legs and create a balanced look. Plus, high-waisted pants or skirts can offer more coverage for your midsection. 4. Layer your outfit: If you're not comfortable showing too much skin, consider wearing a cropped jacket, cardigan, or blazer over your crop top. Layering can add depth and sophistication to your outfit while providing additional coverage. 5. Experiment with patterns and textures: Don't be afraid to mix and match different patterns or textures when wearing a crop top. Combining a bold patterned crop top with solid-colored pants can create a trendy, eye-catching look. Alternatively, playing with textures like lace, velour, or ribbed materials can add visual interest to your outfit. 6. Pay attention to proportions: Create a balanced outfit by ensuring that your top and bottom proportions complement each other. For instance, if you’re wearing a looser, flowing crop top, try pairing it with slim or fitted bottoms. Conversely, a tight crop top can be balanced with loose or wide-leg pants. 7. Accessorize: Complete your crop top look with appropriate accessories. Depending on the occasion and your personal style, you may choose necklaces, bracelets, earrings, belts, or even hats to accentuate the overall attire. The right accessories can enhance your crop top ensemble and bring out your signature style. 8. Adapt your attire to the occasion: Different events and environments call for different styles. Dress your crop top up or down according to the occasion. For a casual day out, pair it with jeans or shorts, and for a night out or a more formal event, try a high-waisted skirt or tailored pants. 9. Consider wearing a bralette: If you're unsure about what type of bra to wear with your crop top, opt for a stylish bralette. Not only are they comfortable, but they're also designed to be seen, so even if it peeks out from your crop top, it'll look intentional and chic. 10. Confidence is key: The most important aspect of wearing a crop top is feeling confident and comfortable in your outfit. Embrace your chosen style, and don't be afraid to make a statement. Remember, fashion is an expression of your personality, and the more confident you feel, the better you'll appear in any attire. By following these tips, you can successfully incorporate crop tops into your wardrobe, experiment with various lengths and styles, and create fashionable and comfortable outfits suitable for any occasion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This rendition of the song was titled \\"Mbube\\" (pronounced mm-boo-bay), which means \\"lion\\" in the Zulu language.  Born in Pomeroy, South Africa, Solomon Linda was a singer-songwriter and a pioneering figure in the South African music scene. His unique and innovative style later paved the way for various forms of African music to gain global recognition. The melody of \\"Mbube\\" was inspired by childhood experiences in the countryside, where Solomon and his friends would chase away lions sneaking up on their cattle. The song \\"Mbube\\" became immensely popular in South Africa, selling over a hundred thousand copies within a few years. It marked the commencement of the era of commercially released African music. The song's success later extended beyond South Africa, attracting interest from the United States and other parts of the world. In the 1950s, the American folk singer Pete Seeger discovered \\"Mbube\\" and recorded a version of the song called \\"Wimoweh,\\" with his band The Weavers. The song became a hit for the band, yet Solomon Linda remained uncredited and uncompensated for his work. Over the years, \\"Wimoweh\\" underwent numerous adaptations by various artists, eventually resulting in the 1961 hit version titled \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight,\\" recorded by the American doo-wop group The Tokens. Although Solomon Linda's song has been reprised and reinterpreted multiple times, it is his original version - \\"Mbube\\" - that stands as the foundation of what became a classic tune known and cherished by millions around the world.

Use evidence from the fact that as distance from an object decreases , the the pull of gravity on that object increases to answer the following question. Choose from options. \\"while passing Jupiter the\\" pick from the following. (a). better the view; (b). stronger the gravity; (c). moon orbits you; (d). gravitational force weakens;","output":"From the given options, the correct answer is (b). stronger the gravity. To provide a detailed and long answer to this question, we will discuss the concept of gravity and its dependence on distance, and then show how it applies to the situation at hand. Gravity is the force of attraction that exists between any two masses. It is described by Isaac Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. This law states that the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2 where F is the force of gravity between the two objects, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. The inverse square relationship between force and distance means that as the distance between two objects decreases, the force of gravity between them increases. Conversely, as the distance increases, the force of gravity decreases. This relationship applies not just to objects on Earth, but also to celestial bodies like planets, stars, and moons. Now, let's consider the question at hand. While passing Jupiter, we want to determine the effect of Jupiter's gravity on an object as the distance from the planet decreases. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a mass of approximately 1.898 × 10^27 kg. This enormous mass results in a strong gravitational pull. As an object moves closer to Jupiter, the distance between the object and the planet decreases. According to the Law of Universal Gravitation, this decrease in distance results in an increase in the force of gravity acting on the object due to Jupiter's mass. Therefore, the statement - \\"while passing Jupiter, the stronger the gravity\\" - accurately reflects the situation. As the object gets closer to Jupiter, the pull of gravity on that object increases due to the inverse square relationship between force and distance. Consequently, the gravitational force acting on the object becomes stronger. In conclusion, while passing Jupiter, the stronger the gravity best describes the relationship between the distance from the planet and the force of attraction between the object and Jupiter. As the object gets closer to Jupiter, the gravitational force it experiences increases, resulting in a stronger pull. This finding demonstrates the inverse square relationship between force and distance in the Law of Universal Gravitation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sicily is a melting pot of a variety of different cultures and ethnicities, including the original Italic people, the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Saracens, Normans, Swabians, Aragonese, Lombards, Spaniards, French, and Albanians, each contributing to the island's culture and genetic makeup. About five million people live in Sicily, making it the fourth most populated region in Italy. In the first century after the Italian unification, Sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to Northern Italy instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities. The most recent ISTAT figures show around 175,000 immigrants out of the total of almost 5.1 million population (nearly 3.5% of the population); Romanians with more than 50,000 make up the most immigrants, followed by Tunisians, Moroccans, Sri Lankans, Albanians, and others mostly from Eastern Europe.

By putting her life above his own, Xander displayed the kind of courage and empathy that is admired in people of all ages. The heart-wrenching event unfolded at a local pool where Xander noticed a fellow swimmer in distress. The young girl was struggling to stay afloat and seemed to be losing the battle against the water. Without hesitation, Xander swam towards her and managed to push her up above him so she could breathe more easily.  As the girl regained her senses and found solid ground, it became increasingly evident that the helpful young boy had grown tired from his life-saving efforts. Tragically, Xander slipped under the water, unnoticed by others in the chaos that followed the rescue.  By the time he was discovered lying motionless at the bottom of the pool, precious minutes had already slipped away. First responders immediately rushed Xander to a nearby hospital, where medical professionals tried desperately to save his life. He ultimately lapsed into a coma, leaving his family and friends praying for a miracle. Despite the immense efforts of the hospital staff and the unwavering support of his loved ones, Xander's condition did not improve. With heavy hearts, his parents made the difficult decision to take him off life support. Surrounded by the people who cared for him most, Xander passed away, leaving a legacy of bravery and selflessness that has touched the hearts of millions.

Когда вам нужно удалить загрязнение или пятно с тканевой поверхности, к примеру, затруднительно сделать это без дополнительных инструментов и чистящих средств. Один из способов, который можно использовать для того чтобы избавиться от таких нежелательных элементов на фабрике, — это применение старой зубной щетки в сочетании с моющим веществом, также называемым \\"пастой\\". Вначале необходимо подготовить работу с поверхностью. Если вы еще не определили, что реагирует на моющее вещество на данной тканевой основе, рекомендуется сначала как следует протестировать реакцию на малозаметном участке ткани. Далее, вам понадобится старая зубная щётка, которую можно использовать без опасения повредить ткань. Важно заранее испытать степень жесткости щетины зубной щетки, чтобы избежать разрывов и излишнего истирания волокон на поверхности ткани. Следует учитывать, что назначение щетки здесь не совсем традиционное: ее применение в этом контексте предполагает нанесение мягкого, равномерного давления на материал.  Приступив к очистке, возьмите зубную щетку и аккуратно нанесите на неё небольшое количество моющего средства. Многие чистящие пасты имеют слабоабразивное действие и некоторые агрессивные составляющие. Вот почему прежде чем применить пасту, необходимо точно изучить состав и инструкцию к препарату, удостоверившись в том, что он безопасно взаимодействует с тканью. Используя зубную щётку с нанесенной на неё пастой, втерите её в ткань. Проведите эту процедуру с лёгкостью, аккуратно перемещая щетку волокон ткани, затем оставьте материал, чтобы паста проникла внутрь на глубину волокон. Это позволит активным веществам очистить поверхность от загрязнения и возможных пятен. После 20 минут подействия моющего средства, необходимо аккуратно промыть ткань водой, чтобы полностью удалить остатки пасты. Это гарантирует, что поверхность будет чистой, без следов загрязнений и пятен. В завершении можно использовать полотенце, чтобы снять излишки влаги, и оставить ткань высохнуть на протяжении некоторого времени. Для этой цели лучше всего подойдет хорошо вентилируемое место, где влажность быстро испарится, а ткань приобретет свежий вид."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It shares borders with Venezuela to the west, Brazil to the south, and Suriname to the east. Georgetown, the capital and largest city of Guyana, is situated along the country's Atlantic coast, specifically on the eastern bank of the Demerara River's mouth. Established in the early 1800s by the British, Georgetown was initially called \\"Stabroek\\" before its name was changed in 1812 to honor King George III. Georgetown enjoys a unique mix of colonial architecture, rich cultural heritage, and diverse demographics due to its long history with the Dutch, French, and British colonial powers. Georgetown serves as Guyana's political, economic, and cultural center, hosting various ministries, government agencies, diplomatic missions, and organizations, such as the Guyana Parliament Building, the Supreme Court of Guyana, and the seat of the Presidency. Besides these, the city is also home to the University of Guyana and the Guyana National Museum, which showcase the nation's history, culture, and achievements. Guyana's economy primarily depends on agriculture, mining, and forestry, with rice, sugar, gold, bauxite, and timber being major products.

The film scrutinizes their inner struggles to overcome or surrender to their misfortunes.The first story, entitled The Stranger, focuses on Arden (Toni Collette), a quiet and diffident woman who lives with and cares for her verbally abusive, invalid mother (Piper Laurie). Arden is the character who finds the titular body and alerts the authorities, much to her mother's dismay.

While Arden prepares for the date in secrecy, her mother calls for her assistance. Upon her arrival to her mother's room, Arden is berated with questions as to her appearance. Arden reacts angrily and attacks her mother before packing her suitcase and leaving home. She then meets Rudy and has masochistic sex with him.The second story, The Sister, revolves around Leah (Rose Byrne), a depressed forensics student, whose sister had gone missing 15 years ago. She is in despair over the fact her parents (Mary Steenburgen and Bruce Davison) are still searching for her lost sister and won't accept her not coming back.

The company reverted in name to Universal Pictures. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In 1964 MCA formed Universal City Studios, Inc., merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as Universal Television in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964. Television production made up much of the studio's output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with NBC (which later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal; see below) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   In which case the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other, case A or case B?  Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A. But the other house didn't have short circuit. He labeled that as case B.  Hint: In the wiring of a building, the wires carrying the current in and out are different and never touch directly. The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires. Answer:","output":"The incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other in case A.  As given in the paragraph, Greg is an electrical engineer who works for an engineering firm that builds houses. He was checking two of the houses and noticed that one of the houses had a short circuit, which he labeled as case A. The other house did not have a short circuit, and he labeled that as case B.  A short circuit occurs when the wire carrying current in comes into direct contact with the wire carrying current out or the ground wire, bypassing the resistor or appliance that is meant to limit the amount of current flowing through the circuit. This causes a massive amount of current to flow through the wires due to the reduced resistance in the circuit, which can lead to damage or even fire. Based on the information provided, we can infer that it is in case A where the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other, as that is the house with the short circuit. In case B, the house did not have a short circuit, which means that the incoming and outgoing wires did not come into direct contact with each other. In this scenario, the wiring is presumably correctly set up, with resistors or appliances ensuring a proper level of electrical current throughout the circuit for safety purposes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:Tests in rats, reported in Stem Cells Translational Medicine, showed the human cells could restore some vision to completely blind rats. The team at University College London said similar results in humans would improve quality of life, but would not give enough vision to read. Human trials should begin within three years. Donated corneas are already used to improve some people's sight, but the team at the Institute for Ophthalmology, at UCL, extracted a special kind of cell from the back of the eye. These Muller glia cells are a type of adult stem cell capable of transforming into the specialised cells in the back of the eye and may be useful for treating a wide range of sight disorders. In the laboratory, these cells were chemically charmed into becoming rod cells which detect light in the retina. Injecting the rods into the backs of the eyes of completely blind rats partially restored their vision. Brain scans showed that 50% of the electrical signals between the eye and the brain were recovered by the treatment. One of the researchers, Prof Astrid Limb, told the BBC what such a change would mean in people: \\"They probably wouldn't be able to read, but they could move around and detect a table in a room. \\"They would be able to identify a kettle and cup to make a cup of tea. Their quality of life would be so much better, even if they could not read or watch TV.\\" The cells might be able to help patients with disorders such as macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. Human stem cell trials are already taking place using material taken from embryos. However, this is ethically charged and takes several months to prepare the cells. The Muller glia cells can be ready within a week. Prof Limb commented: \\"They are more easily sourceable and very easy to handle in the lab so from that perspective they're better, but they do express antigens that could induce an immune response.\\" It means the donated cells could be rejected like an organ transplant. The next step is to prepare the cells as a clinical grade treatment in order for human trials to begin. The researchers believe it could take three years before such a trial takes place. Dr Paul Colville-Nash, the regenerative medicine programme manager at the Medical Research Council, which funded the study, said: \\"This interesting study shows that Muller glial cells are another viable avenue of exploration for cell therapy in retinal diseases. \\"It's not clear yet which approach will be most effective when these experimental techniques enter human trials, which is why it is important to progress research across all avenues in pursuit of a cure for sight loss.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Researchers at University College London have reported in Stem Cells Translational Medicine that human cells were able to partially restore vision in completely blind rats.

FDA favors first drug for HIV prevention WASHINGTON – Federal drug regulators on Tuesday affirmed landmark study results showing that a popular HIV-fighting pill can also help healthy people avoid contracting the virus that causes AIDS in the first place. While the pill appears safe and effective for prevention, scientists stressed that it only works when taken on a daily basis. The Food and Drug Administration will hold a meeting Thursday to discuss whether Truvada should be approved for people who are at risks of contracting HIV through sexual intercourse. The agency's positive review posted Tuesday suggests the daily pill will become the first drug approved to prevent HIV infection in high-risk patients. FDA reviewers conclude that taking Truvada pre-emptively could spare patients \\"infection with a serious and life-threatening illness that requires lifelong treatment.\\" Despite the positive results, reviewers said that patients must be diligent about taking the pill every day. Adherence to the medication was less than perfect in clinical trials, and reviewers said that patients in the real world may forget to take their medication even more than those in clinical studies. First announced in 2010, Truvada's preventive ability was hailed as a breakthrough in the 30-year campaign against the AIDS epidemic. A three-year study found that daily doses cut the risk of infection in healthy gay and bisexual men by 44 percent, when accompanied by condoms and counseling. Another study found that Truvada reduced infection by 75 percent in heterosexual couples in which one partner was HIV infected and the other was not. The FDA's panel of advisers will take separate votes on whether Truvada should be approved for: — gay and bisexual men — men or women in relationships with HIV-positive partners — other people at risk of acquiring HIV through sexual activity The FDA is not required to follow the advice of its panels, though it usually does. An estimated 1.2 million Americans have HIV, which overwhelmingly affects men who have sex with other men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HIV attacks the immune system and, unless treated with antiviral drugs, develops into AIDS, a fatal condition in which the body cannot fight off foreign infections. Because Truvada is already on the market to manage HIV, some doctors currently prescribe it as a preventive measure. FDA approval would allow the drugmaker Gilead Sciences to formally market its drug for the new use. But support for FDA approval is not unanimous. Some researchers stress that condoms remain the best weapon against AIDS, and a prevention pill is not the chemical equivalent. \\"We know that if the person doesn't take the medication every day they will not be protected,\\" said Dr. Rodney Wright, director of HIV programs at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \\"So the concern is that there may not be adequate adherence to provide protection in the general population.\\" Wright, who is also chairman of the AIDS Health Foundation, added that some upcoming medications may be more effective at preventing infection than Truvada. Researchers also worry about Truvada's mixed success rate in preventing infection among women. Last year a study in women was stopped early after researchers found that women taking the drug were more likely to become infected than those taking placebo. Researchers speculated that women may need a higher dose of the drug to prevent infection. They also said the disappointing results may have resulted from women not taking the pills consistently. Still, many HIV patient advocacy groups say the drug should be a prescribing option to prevent HIV, alongside condoms, counseling and other measures. \\"If we're going to reduce the more than 50,000 new HIV infections in this country each year, we need to increase the available options for people,\\" said Ronald Johnson, vice president of AIDS United. He added that more studies are needed to determine the drug's effectiveness in women and other patient subgroups. \\"The current state of the data warrants going forward, but we believe additional clinical trials should also go forward to broaden the use of Truvada.\\" Last month, AIDS United and more than a dozen other advocacy groups sent a letter to the FDA, urging approval of Truvada. Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead Sciences Inc. has marketed Truvada since 2004. The drug is a combination of two older HIV drugs, Emtriva and Viread. Doctors usually prescribe the medications as part of a drug cocktail that makes it harder for the virus to reproduce. Patients with low viral levels are far less likely to develop AIDS. Side effects with Truvada include diarrhea, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. More serious problems can include liver toxicity, kidney problems and bone thinning. Company shares fell 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 49.34 What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The FDA is considering approving a pill called Truvada for people at risk of getting HIV through sexual intercourse.

Please answer the following question: Article: The ruins of Moore, Oklahoma, a town destructed for the fourth time in 14 years by a major tornado , are a reminder that current building codes  can't do much to prevent property destruction and loss of life, especially when a powerful tornado cuts through town. But the total death number can be reduced when people take shelter in underground storm bunkers and hardened safe rooms. The tornado that carved a path of destruction through Moore took 24 lives. Its winds were clocked at 400 kilometers per hour. With only 15 minutes' warning, residents fled town or took refuge in the firmest corners of their homes. The luckiest were able to climb into shelters or move to safe rooms.  In Moore those rooms saved lives. But at two schools destroyed by Monday's tornado, no such shelter was available. Leslie Chapman Henderson is CEO of a non-profit group called the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. She's an advocate for tornado safe rooms.   \\"The safe room is an interior room of the home that has been reinforced and tested to withstand high wind. In fact, we've already heard of stories of survival of people who were in safe rooms, either above or below ground,\\" she said.  Better storm forecasts give people more time to react. But they need someplace safe to go. Buildings can be built to resist strong winds, but not like those in the F-5 tornado that touched down in Moore. Chapman Henderson says even the building codes that do exist are not widely adopted or enforced.  As its residents prepare to rebuild, Moore's mayor is pushing for an order to make safe rooms compulsory in all new construction. Similar proposals were made following each of the previous tornado strikes, but none were adopted. Question: According to Chapman Henderson, which of the following does she probably agree with?

Answer the following question: Information:  - An accident, also known as an unintentional injury, is an undesirable, incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term \\"accident\\" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity (Robertson, 2015).  - Death is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include biological aging, predation, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, starvation, dehydration, and accidents or trauma resulting in terminal injury. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death.   - Nazareth (\\"Narat\\" \\"Narath\\" \\"an-Nira\\") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \\"the Arab capital of Israel\\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. \\"Upper Nazareth\\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974.  - Lazarus of Bethany , also known as Saint Lazarus or Lazarus of the Four Days , is the subject of a prominent miracle attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John , in which Jesus restores him to life four days after his death . The Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life . In the context of the seven signs in the Gospel of John , the Raising of Lazarus is the climactic narrative : exemplifying the power of Jesus \`\` over the last and most irresistible enemy of humanity -- death . For this reason it is given a prominent place in the gospel . '' A figure named \`\` Lazarus '' ( Latinised from the Aramaic :  , Elzr , cf. Heb. Eleazar -- \`\` God is my help '' ) is also mentioned in the Gospel of Luke . The two Biblical characters named \`\` Lazarus '' have sometimes been conflated historically , but are generally understood to be two separate people . The name \`\` Lazarus '' is frequently used in science and popular culture in reference to apparent restoration to life ; for example , the scientific term \`\` Lazarus taxon '' denotes organisms that reappear in the fossil record after a period of apparent extinction . There are also numerous literary uses of the term .  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.  - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books.  - Malnutrition or malnourishment is a condition that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems. It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals. Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition. Malnutrition is often used specifically to refer to undernutrition where there is not enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development. Extreme undernourishment, known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen. People also often get infections and are frequently cold. The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking. Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery. Efforts to improve nutrition are some of the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and...  - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of...

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Johns is which band's primary songwriter? , can you please find it?   In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony.

With a career spanning six decades, she has reached legendary status in multiple fields of entertainment and is among a small group of entertainers who have been honored with an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award. She is considered both an American icon and a gay icon.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - The Big Bird Cage is a 1972 American exploitation film of the \\"women in prison\\" subgenre. It serves as a non-sequel follow-up to the 1971 film \\"The Big Doll House\\". The film was written and directed by Jack Hill, and stars Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Anitra Ford, and Carol Speed.  - A cinematographer or director of photography (sometimes shortened to DP or DOP) is the chief over the camera crews working on a film, television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image. The study and practice of this field is referred to as cinematography. Some filmmakers say that the cinematographer is just the chief over the camera and lighting, and the director of photography is the chief over all the photography components of film, including framing, costumes, makeup, and lighting, as well as the assistant of the post producer for color correction and grading.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Joe D'Amato (birth name: Aristide Massaccesi; 15 December 1936 in Rome  23 January 1999 in Rome) was an Italian filmmaker who directed roughly 200 films, usually whilst also serving as producer and cinematographer, and sometimes providing script-writing duties as well. While D'Amato contributed to many different genres (such as spaghetti westerns, horror, war movies, swashbucklers, peplums, and fantasy), the majority of his films are exploitation-themed pornography, both soft and hardcore. He is generally considered the most prolific Italian filmmaker of all time.  - A gladiator (\\"swordsman\\", from , \\"sword\\") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals.

Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.  - Pornography (often abbreviated to porn or porno in informal language) is the portrayal of sexual subject matter for the purpose of sexual arousal. Pornography may be presented in a variety of media, including books, magazines, postcards, photographs, sculpture, drawing, painting, animation, sound recording, writing, film, video, and video games. The term applies to the depiction of the act rather than the act itself, and so does not include live exhibitions like sex shows and striptease. The primary subjects of pornographic depictions are pornographic models, who pose for still photographs, and pornographic actors or porn stars, who perform in pornographic films. If dramatic skills are not involved, a performer in a porn film may also be called a model.  - An exploitation film is a film that attempts to succeed financially by exploiting current trends, niche genres, or lurid content.  - Women in prison film (or WiP) is a subgenre of exploitation film that began in the early 1900s and continues to the present day.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Coffy is a 1973 American blaxploitation film written and directed by American filmmaker Jack Hill.

Which country experienced an increase in collection amounts?  The country of Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would mean more money for government spending. On the other hand, Silvania, a southern country increased taxation hoping they would increase collection amounts. The problem was that Silvanian people increased taxation above the critical rate.  Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.","output":"The country which experienced an increase in collection amounts is Hinland. The paragraph explains that Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would lead to more money for government spending. By doing so, they likely brought their tax rate below the critical rate described by the Laffer curve. On the contrary, Silvania increased taxation above the critical rate, which would result in decreasing government revenue due to a decline in labor supply caused by high tax rates.  The Laffer curve demonstrates that when the tax rate surpasses a certain critical point, the government's revenue will decrease as the tax rate increases. This is because, at higher tax rates, individuals are less inclined to work, reducing the overall labor supply and thereby lowering the government's tax revenue. By decreasing the tax rate, Hinland was able to stimulate an increase in labor supply, which in turn led to higher government revenue."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This legendary English rock band is known for its transformative influence on the music industry and pop culture during their active years between 1960 and 1970. \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" is one of their iconic songs and a crucial milestone in their career. \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and originally released in the UK on 29 November 1963 by Parlophone as the group's sixth UK single. Then, after introducing it to the American music scene, it was released in the US on 26 December 1963 by Capitol Records and it marked the Beatles' breakthrough there. The song has a significant history behind it. Marsha Albert, a 15-year-old resident of Silver Spring, Maryland, was instrumental in coaxing a reluctant American music industry to introduce the Beatles to the U.S. airwaves. After seeing a segment about the Beatles on CBS Evening News, she wrote to Washington D.C. radio station WWDC requesting Beatles music, saying, \\"Why can't we have music like that here in America?\\" The station's disc jockey, Carroll James, arranged to have a copy of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" flown in from England. On December 17, 1963, James played it on the radio for the first time in America, recalling how he had requested Albert to introduce it. That moment proved pivotal for the Beatles' success in the United States. \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" became their first number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, holding that position for seven weeks, and was the beginning of the British Invasion of the American music scene.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Definition: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Input: find the average price_in_euros and the minimum price_in_pounds in Catalog_Contents table Output:","output":"In this task, you are asked to provide an SQL statement based on the given English description. The description wants you to find the average price_in_euros and the minimum price_in_pounds from the Catalog_Contents table. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to construct this SQL statement: 1. Since we are required to find the average and minimum price, we will use the aggregate functions AVG() and MIN(). 2. We will use SELECT to choose the columns needed (average price_in_euros and minimum price_in_pounds). 3. We will use FROM to specify the table Catalog_Contents. The SQL statement to achieve the above task is: \`\`\`sql SELECT AVG(price_in_euros) AS avg_price_in_euros, MIN(price_in_pounds) AS min_price_in_pounds FROM Catalog_Contents; \`\`\` This statement finds the average of the price_in_euros and the minimum of the price_in_pounds from the Catalog_Contents table and returns the result. The column names are then renamed as avg_price_in_euros and min_price_in_pounds using the AS statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Now it's called what?  Choices:  - bedroom - istanbul - body - human being - treasure  The rationale to choose \\"istanbul\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The answer 'Istanbul' is the most logical choice, given the context of the question and the available options. This rationale is based on several factors, such as historical evidence, geographical changes, cultural implications, and the inapplicability of the other options to the situation. We can break down the reasons for choosing \\"Istanbul\\" as follows: 1. Historical evidence: Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is a city with a rich history that has undergone several transformations due to political shifts and cultural changes. In 1453, when the Ottoman Empire conquered the city, it was renamed Istanbul. Mary's grandfather might have been originally from Constantinople, and thus, it is no longer called by the same name as when he left. Considering the timeline of events and the history of the city, Istanbul is the most likely correct option. 2. Geographical changes: Changing the name of a place is not unusual throughout history. For example, many cities have been renamed due to political reasons, either by the ruling government, after gaining independence, or following an invasion. If Mary's grandfather was from such a place, then it is reasonable to assume that the city she could no longer return to is now called Istanbul. 3. Cultural implications: The name Istanbul is deeply rooted in Turkish culture, dating back to the ancient period of the Byzantine Empire. The influence of the Ottoman Empire on the city made it an important center for the Islamic world and Europe. Choosing \\"Istanbul\\" as the answer is also a subtle acknowledgment of the cultural significance of the city and its historic connection with various civilizations. 4. Inapplicability of other options: The other options presented as potential answers - bedroom, body, human being, and treasure - do not align with the context of the question. Each of these options refers to something entirely different from a place or geographical location. For instance, \\"bedroom\\" is a room, \\"body\\" and \\"human being\\" are biological terms, and \\"treasure\\" signifies something valuable. None of these options accurately represents a place that Mary's grandfather might have come from or where she could no longer return to. In conclusion, using historical references, geographical changes, the cultural significance of Istanbul, and the inapplicability of other options, we can confidently choose \\"Istanbul\\" as the correct answer to the question. Mary's grandfather's birthplace is no longer called by the same name due to a shift in political landscape, and the place's name has changed to Istanbul, making it the most relevant selection among the choices provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? The answer is:","output":"The product review conveys a negative sentiment.  The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of the book, \\"The Bride of the Wind,\\" noting that it fails to bring the subject, Alma Mahler, to life.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Hill members grill CDC on Ebola at hearing Washington (CNN) -- A House panel sharply questioned health officials Thursday over the U.S. response to the Ebola virus, as well as steps to prevent an outbreak of the disease in the United States. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden and other government officials faced tough questions from members of both parties after a second Texas nurse was diagnosed with Ebola, but the line of questioning from Republicans and Democrats on the investigative committee pushed two contrasting paths to keep the disease from spreading in the U.S. Republicans again called for travel restrictions to prevent new Ebola cases from coming to U.S. shores while Democrats provided backup for the Obama administration and gave health officials, including Frieden, a chance to explain why a ban would not be effective and could, in fact, make the situation worse. Rep. Tim Murphy, the Republican who chaired the hearing, asked the CDC director how the Texas nurse who treated the only patient to have died in the U.S. of Ebola was able to board a plane after checking in with the Center. He also raised questions about policies to keep Ebola off of U.S. soil. \\"The trust and credibility of the administration and government are waning,\\" Murphy said, adding that the U.S. should \\"do everything in our power to keep the American people safe from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\\" How did nurse who treated Ebola patient fly on commercial jet? Murphy said a ban on travelers from West Africa could keep the disease from spreading further in the U.S and said that screening patients for fever is not enough to present a disease, citing a study that about 13% of patients infected with Ebola in West Africa had no fever. Frieden insisted that current screenings at U.S and West African airports were sufficient to protect Americans, but said he would \\"consider any options to better protect Americans. The ranking Democrat Rep. Diana DeGette agreed with Friden that a travel ban would be effective and said that while another person with Ebola symptoms will likely land at a U.S. hospital, the American health system can prevent the disease from spreading. \\"We should not panic. We know how to stop Ebola outbreaks,\\" she said. \\"The best way to stop Ebola is to fight it in Africa.\\" How the Ebola virus spreads Murphy suggested the administration would not establish a ban to avoid hurting \\"fledgling democracies\\" in West Africa, but said that shouldn't be a concern for American officials as they look to protect Americans. Rep. Fred Upton, the full committee's chairman, suggested banning people who have been in the most affected West African nations from entering the U.S. to keep those who may have been infected with Ebola but haven't yet showed symptoms of the disease at bay. \\"I just don't understand [how] we can't look at one's travel history and say, 'no, you're not coming here, not until this situation' -- you're right it needs to be solved in Africa, but until it is we should not be allowing these folks in. Period,\\" Upton said. But Frieden said a ban could encourage people in West Africa to take advantage of porous borders in the region and get to the United States another way, which would undermine U.S. efforts to screen patients at airports and be able to track and monitor potentially infected people. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman used some of their time during the hearing to blame spending cuts for undercutting the Centers for Disease Control and National Institute of Health's ability to fight the disease. Waxman noted that the CDC budget has dropped by 12% since 2006 and that the public health emergency preparedness fund has been cut to 612 million from 1 billion in 2002. Waxman also used his time during the hearing to feed questions to Frieden and infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Health to push their explanation of the unintended consequences of imposing a travel ban. \\"It's certainly understandable how someone might come to a conclusion that the best approach would be to just seal off the border from those countries,\\" Fauci said. \\"[A travel ban would lead to] a big web of things we don't know what we're dealing with.\\" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, picked up on Frieden's \\"porous borders\\" comment thinking the CDC director was referring to the U.S.'s borders and asked if the U.S. should \\"worry about having an unsecured southern and northern border.\\" \\"Oh you're referring to that border and not our porous border,\\" Blackburn said after Frieden corrected her. In his opening remarks, Frieden also said the U.S. has helped implement effective airport screenings at airports in affected countries and noted that those screenings identified 74 people with fever in September. He also noted his agency's heightened efforts to increase awareness among physicians about how to identify Ebola. 5 things nurses say the Texas hospital got wrong A second health care worker was diagnosed with Ebola on Wednesday. Amber Vinson, 29, works as a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was treated. Duncan died last week. But many are questioning how Vinson was able to board a commercial flight and travel back and forth to Ohio after she was being monitored as part of the team that cared for Duncan. Vinson was moved from Dallas to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Wednesday, where two others who contracted Ebola were treated. But Frieden said that Vinson should never have traveled on a commercial plane. Nina Pham, a nurse who also treated Duncan, was the first at the Dallas Hospital to be diagnosed with Ebola, but her condition has improved, and she is being transfered to NIH in Maryland. House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement late Wednesday, \\"A temporary ban on travel to the United States from countries afflicted with the virus is something that the president should absolutely consider along with any other appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow.\\" So far Administration officials have cautioned that putting a ban in place could complicate the ability to get supplies and personnel to the affected region, and make it harder to stop the spread of the disease. The Texas hospital where Duncan was treated has been criticized for how it responded to Duncan's symptoms, and for failing to put protocols in place to protect those health care workers who came in contact with him. In prepared testimony, Daniel Varga, the Chief Clinical Officer for the Texas company that includes Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, apologized to the House committee. \\"Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes. We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry,\\" Varga said.","output":"A group of important people in the US government talked to health officials about how the US is dealing with the Ebola virus. They want to make sure everyone in the US is safe from the disease. Some people think that the US should not let people from countries where Ebola is a problem come to the US. Others think that stopping people from coming won't help and may make it harder to help those countries that are affected by Ebola. The health officials said that they are doing their best to keep Americans safe, and they are working to stop the disease from spreading in Africa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who bakes pies? is inside the article: Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is shot. The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after he is interrogated and confesses to the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house during a weekend jaunt, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With the help of her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is a success.

In the latest study on what may well be a superfood, scientists at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, report in the journal Food Research International that red onions in particular boast an ability to disrupt cancer cell communication and promote a generally poor environment for cancer cells, \\"which inhibits growth.\\" The team was looking specifically at colon cancer, but they found that the onion cells are just as good at killing breast cancer cells. The trick, reports Huffpost, will be to extract the key ingredient, dose it just right, and use it medicinally. That key ingredient is quercetin, a flavonoid already known for its cancer-fighting properties. This study finds that onions in general have unusually high levels of quercetin compared to other foods, and that Ontario onions in particular have high levels of the compound compared to onions grown elsewhere. But red onions also boast high levels of anthocyanin, a plant pigment that help make quercetin molecules better scavengers. (Because anthocyanin helps make foods colorful, it makes sense to the researchers that red onions, which are so dark, have the greatest cancer-fighting potential.) It's unclear whether red onions from outside of Ontario will be as effective, but Time reports the researchers think it's likely, and plan to start clinical trials. (Onions also help reduce the risk of heart disease.) Expand this summary.","output":"Onions, specifically red onions, have long been considered a healthy addition to a balanced diet due to their numerous health benefits. Recently, scientists at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, conducted a study published in the journal Food Research International, which revealed that red onions could potentially be labeled as a superfood thanks to their remarkable cancer-fighting properties. The study focused mainly on colon cancer but also found that onion cells had similar effects on breast cancer cells. Red onions displayed a unique ability to disrupt cancer cell communication and create an unfavorable environment for cancer cells to grow in. This new information opens up further possibilities for cancer treatment through extracting the specific compound responsible for these effects and using it as a therapeutic agent with appropriate dosage. The key cancer-fighting ingredient found in onions is a flavonoid called quercetin. It is already well-known for its anticancer properties among researchers. The study discovered that onions in general, compared to other foods, had significantly higher levels of quercetin. Furthermore, onions cultivated in Ontario were found to contain even higher concentrations of this particular compound. However, what sets red onions apart from others is their elevated levels of another compound called anthocyanin. Anthocyanin is a plant pigment responsible for the vibrant colors in various fruits, vegetables, and flowers. In red onions, anthocyanin is thought to enhance the effectiveness of quercetin molecules, making them stronger scavengers. The presence of anthocyanin in red onions lends credence to the researchers' hypothesis regarding their superior cancer-fighting potential compared to other onions. As of now, it remains uncertain whether red onions grown outside of Ontario will exhibit similar cancer-fighting properties. However, the research team believes that this is probably the case and intends to proceed with clinical trials to evaluate the effects of red onions on cancer patients. In addition to their cancer-fighting potential, onions have been known to offer numerous other health benefits. They are an excellent source of vitamins (A, B6, C, and E), minerals (potassium, calcium, sodium, and iron), and dietary fiber. Furthermore, red onions have been linked to reduced risk of heart disease, improved digestive function, and enhanced immune function. In conclusion, incorporating red onions into a balanced diet may provide a wealth of health advantages, including their newly discovered cancer-fighting properties. As research continues to unravel the full potential of this flavorful vegetable, it becomes increasingly evident that red onions may indeed be a superfood worth adding to our plates."},{"instruction":"Title: Bed Frame Product review: I received the bed frame quickly and the price appeared to be a good price.

Lindsey rigged the system in their favor to beat Victoria, because  Choose from: -Lindsey was never going to win otherwise. -Victoria was never going to win otherwise.","output":"Lindsey rigged the system in their favor to beat Victoria, because Lindsey was never going to win otherwise. Ever since they were kids, Lindsey and Victoria were pitted against each other, whether it was in academics, sports, or extracurricular activities. While it wasn't always a contentious rivalry, it was clear that both of them felt the pressure to succeed and outdo the other. Growing up, Victoria had always been the one who received accolades, awards, and admiration from their peers and teachers. She was naturally talented and had a charismatic personality that drew people to her. Lindsey, on the other hand, had always been more of a 'middle of the pack' type. They had to work harder just to match Victoria's level, and this intense competition put a strain on their friendship. As they grew older, the disparity in their abilities, success, and popularity widened. Victoria seemed to excel at everything she tried, whereas Lindsey often fell short. This imbalance led Lindsey to develop feelings of inadequacy, frustration, and jealousy towards Victoria. When the opportunity presented itself for a devious plan, Lindsey saw this as a chance to finally steal the spotlight. They knew they couldn't hope to compete with Victoria on a level playing field, so they began scheming to tip the scales in their favor. In the weeks leading up to the big competition, Lindsey spent countless hours researching tactics, loopholes, and tricks that would enable them to achieve victory at any cost. As the competition day neared, Lindsey put their plan into action. They used every resource at their disposal to manipulate the odds in their favor. They hacked the competition's computer system to alter the scores and tampered with the judging criteria, ensuring that they would be given a significant advantage over Victoria. When the competition finally arrived, all of Lindsey's manipulations and months of planning paid off. They successfully rigged the system, and Victoria was defeated - a first in all their years as rivals. But even as they stood on the winner's podium, basking in the glory of their hard-won triumph, Lindsey couldn't shake off the nagging feeling that their victory was tainted. The recognition, the attention, and the satisfaction that they'd always craved felt hollow. They realized that in their desperate bid to prove themselves, they had sacrificed the genuine friendship they once shared with Victoria. This victory had come at a high price, one that Lindsey wasn't sure they were willing to pay. As their peers showered them with praise and congratulations, they couldn't help but wonder if it was all worth it. In the end, the true cost of Lindsey's deceit was much higher than they had anticipated. Sure, they had finally managed to outdo Victoria in this one instance, but the damage done to their own self-esteem and to the relationships that mattered most to them was irreversible. It was a harsh lesson, as they learned that sometimes the pursuit of victory can lead to the ultimate defeat in the game of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, He is actually supermans son, who would have ever thought....) and the acting was horrible. This movie has one good thing going for it, and it's name is Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie.

Comments on Superman as a character: The reviewer mentions that Superman deserves respect but criticizes the portrayal of the character in the movie (\\"Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen\\"). 3. Negative comments on the actor (Brandon Routh): The reviewer asserts a strong dislike for the actor, wanting to \\"shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat\\" and stating that he looks \\"silly\\" in the costume. 4. Negative comments on the actress (Kate Bosworth): The reviewer states that Kate Bosworth was a \\"bad choice\\" for Lois Lane, and her portrayal of the character didn't fit the expectations of a \\"hard-ass reporter.\\" 5. Comments on the plot: The plot is described as \\"weak and predictable,\\" indicating dissatisfaction. 6.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? A professional mental health therapist can help you identify the source of your negative emotions and develop healthy skills to lead a more satisfying life. Your self-worth may have been jeopardized by unhealthy relationships or abuse from your past. Talking about these experiences in a unbiased and supportive context can lead to healing.  One recognized form of therapy for those who self-sabotage is dialectical behavior therapy. This treatment approach is directed at gaining a better understanding of your feelings in order to build skills that help you stop problematic behaviors. You may work with your therapist to prevent overeating, stop risky sexual activities, and establish healthy relational patterns.  Another is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT will help you identify beliefs that fuel your self-worth. Once you identify those beliefs, you can explore their origins and validity and eventually replace them with thoughts and beliefs that are true. Self-sabotage is prominent in people who feel depressed but do not know how to express or improve their emotions. If feeling unloved has led to depressive symptoms, you need to see a doctor.  Depression may manifest as a loss of interest in once pleasurable activities, withdrawing from loved ones, having trouble eating or sleeping, and feeling hopeless. A certain class of prescribed medications known as antidepressants are effective at improve depressive symptoms. This may be advisable if therapy alone does not improve your symptoms. Support is imperative for anyone struggling with mental illness. It's vital to build a network of health care providers and loved one who are there for you as you heal. However, meeting with other people who have gone through what you are going through can also be comforting. Ask your mental health provider about support groups for people who are struggling with the same issues as you. Attending these groups can help you learn how others cope with feeling unloved and help you gain a sense of belonging in a supportive group. Summary:","output":"This article highlights the benefits of professional mental health therapy, such as dialectical behavior therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, in helping individuals identify negative emotions, self-sabotaging behaviors, and depressive symptoms, while suggesting the importance of support networks including healthcare providers, loved ones, and support groups in promoting healing and improved self-worth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking?  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake.

A:","output":"Tree city experienced the release of energy that was stored in the rocks less often. This is because Tree city had fewer and less frequent earthquakes compared to Red city. The distance to a volcano and plate boundaries could be a contributing factor for this difference, as Tree city is further away from the volcano (60 miles) compared to Red city (10 miles).

Herbert Sausgruber was born close to which Central European freshwater lake? Answer:","output":"Herbert Sausgruber was born in Hohenems, Austria. Hohenems is a town situated in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, which is in the westernmost part of Austria, sharing borders with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. Having this information, we can now determine the prominent Central European freshwater lake near his birthplace. In this region, there are several lakes, but the most significant one is Lake Constance (known as Bodensee in German). Lake Constance borders Germany, Austria, and Switzerland and is the largest lake in Western Europe's Alpine region. With an area of approximately 536 square kilometers, the lake spans over 63 km in length and 14 km in width. It was formed by the Rhine Glacier during the last ice age and is now a crucial water source for the region. Hohenems, the birthplace of Herbert Sausgruber, is approximately 40 kilometers east of Lake Constance as the crow flies, making it the most relevant lake in the context. While there might be smaller freshwater bodies closer to Hohenems, Lake Constance holds significant importance as a Central European freshwater lake due to its size, historical relevance, and impact on the region's ecology and economy.

Answer the following question: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. What can put the presidency at risk?

This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.Several years would pass before Simon & Garfunkel worked together again.

Intergalactic travel for humans is therefore possible, in theory, from the point of view of the traveller. Question: if travelling at the speed of light would it take 1 million years to reach the andromeda galaxy?","output":"To answer the question, let's first understand the important concepts involved in this scenario, and then calculate how long it would take to reach the Andromeda Galaxy if traveling at the speed of light. Step 1: Know the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy The distance between Earth and the Andromeda Galaxy is approximately 2.54 million light-years. Step 2: Understand the concept of time dilation Time dilation occurs when an object is moving close to the speed of light. The faster the object travels, the slower the time passes for that object relative to an observer at rest. Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the traveler if traveling at the speed of light If the traveler was hypothetically traveling at the speed of light (which is physically impossible for any object with mass), time dilation would be at its maximum. The time experienced by the traveler moving at the speed of light would theoretically be infinitely less than the time experienced by an observer at rest. As a result, if a traveler could somehow achieve the speed of light, from their perspective, it would take less than 1 million years to reach the Andromeda Galaxy. However, this is only a theoretical concept, as no object with mass can reach the speed of light. If and when humans develop intergalactic travel technologies, they would need to rely on speeds closer to but less than the speed of light, and the travel time would be subject to time dilation effects accordingly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered to be in the Taxisco area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army.

You know waves, right? Like when you throw a stone into a puddle and you see circles moving away from the stone?  Let me explain each one to you: 1. \\"Intensity and energy of a wave\\": This is a bit like the difference between how hard you shout and how long you shout. The energy of a wave is like how long you shout. It's the total amount of \\"wave\\" you have to use, which depends on both how loud (or \\"big\\") the wave is and how long it lasts. On the other hand, intensity is like how hard (or \\"loud\\") you shout. It's the energy the wave has at a certain place at a certain time, or the amount of \\"wave\\" that hits a certain place in a certain time.  2. \\"Wave speed and wave frequency\\": This is like the difference between how fast you run and how often you jump while you're running. The speed of a wave is like how fast you run—it's how fast the wave moves. If you imagine you and your friend are holding a long, stretched slinky and you move one end, the wave you create will move to the other end, right? That's wave speed. But then, frequency is like how often you jump while running—it's how many waves pass by a certain point in a certain time. If you move the slinky back and forth two times in one second, the frequency of your waves is two per second.  Does that help, kiddo?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: When I was young I wanted to be a model,so when a national contest was staged,I convinced my parents to take me for an audition  .I was selected and told I had potential.They said that for only 900 I could attend a weekend event which dozens of the most prestigious   modeling agencies from around the world would attend.At 13,my hopes of fame and fortune clouded all judgement and I begged my parents to let me go.We have never been rich,but they saw my enthusiasm and agreed. I imagined being signed by some famous model companies.For months,any boredom or disappointment I faced was pushed aside because I knew I would soon have the chance to be real model.I thought I would grace the covers of famous magazines! Of course,I wasn't signed,but what hurt the most was being told that if I grew to 5'9''(about 1.75 metres) I could be a success.I prayed for a growth spurt   because I could not imagine giving up my dream.I made an appointment with a local modeling agency and the agent demanded 500 for classes.500 for a photo shoot,and 300 for other expenses.My parents only agreed after hours and hours of my begging. The agency sent me out on a few auditions,but with every day I didn't receive a call,I grew more depressed. _ came in July after I had decided to focus on commercial modeling.There was an open call in New York City.We spent hours driving and another few hours waiting,only to be told that I was too short.I was devastated  . Years later,I realized that the trip to New York was good as it made me notice I didn't actually love modeling,just the idea of it.I wanted to be special and I was innocently determined to reach an impossible goal.The experience has made me stronger and that will help me in the future. What's the author's parents' attitude toward her dream? A) Encouraging. B) Worried. C) Doubtful. D) Enthusiastic. Answer:","output":"A) Encouraging. The justification for this answer is found throughout the text. Despite the fact that the author's parents were not rich, they agreed to invest a significant amount of money in her dream, indicating their encouragement and support. They paid for the expensive weekend event when she was 13 years old and later also agreed to pay for the classes, photo shoot, and other expenses charged by the local modeling agency, even though these expenditures were significant.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

Context: Yes, after my mother died I found out from my supposed half-sister that my dad was not my birth father. She was 19 yrs older than me and had been living in Colorado since I was young. I was born and raised in N.J. I did not see her she did not come to see us. I was grown, married, had children and was living in FL. when she showed up at my door with her husband. I was shocked since we never heard from her and I did not know she even knew where I lived. She stayed all of about 20 minutes, just long enough to very unpleasantly state that “my father is NOT your father and I am NOT your sister!” I always wondered why my mom hated me SO much, I found out that both my mom and “dad\\" were having affairs while married and both had children by someone else. I have never met my birth father (to my knowledge) only know his name, but understand that he was the father of my supposed half-brother (which would make him my only whole sibling out of seven siblings.) Obviously my oldest “half-brother\\", who is 20 yrs older than me, is not actually related to me either. I don't have for sure “proof\\" about my other siblings, but they all have strong resemblances to my “dad\\" and each other. Growing up people would comment about how much I looked like my mom but I also was told a lot that you would never know me and my other sisters were sisters, we used to laugh about it as kids because my sisters (all light haired/light skinned) and I (dark haired/deeper skin toned) were very different in appearance but we “knew\\" we were sisters. I also found out that my apparently ONLY whole brother, approximately 9 yrs older than me, did not even know his real fathers name even though he knew our “dad“ was not his birth father. Question: How long probably was it since the author had seen her supposed half-sister?

Available choices: [A]. yes [B]. no","output":"[B]. No, the answer is incorrect because it does not provide information about the length of the Plymouth Sound Breakwater in kilometers. The Plymouth Sound Breakwater is a man-made structure located in Plymouth Sound, a body of water situated off the coast of Plymouth in England. The breakwater was built to provide a safe anchorage for naval vessels and to protect the harbor from destructive waves caused by storms. The construction of the Plymouth Sound Breakwater started in 1812 and was completed in 1841. Throughout these years, about 4 million tons of limestone from nearby quarries on the shores of Plymouth Sound was used to form the breakwater. The Plymouth Sound Breakwater measures 1,560 meters long, or 1.56 kilometers. Its width at the base is approximately 65 meters, while its width at the top is about 10 meters. The breakwater stands around 4 meters above the high-water level. To further enhance its protective role, a lighthouse known as the Plymouth Sound Breakwater Fort was built on the breakwater. Its main goal was to protect the entrance to Plymouth Sound, recognizing the strategic importance of Plymouth Sound as a point of naval and merchant shipping.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Spiders are not insects as many people believe. They belong to a class of animals called arachnids . Spiders have eight eyes, four pairs of legs, and can grow a new leg if they lose one. A spider's body is divided into two sections: the abdomen  and the thorax .The legs, eyes, and mouthparts are in the thorax section. Most spiders have poison glands and sharp teeth. They use their sharp teeth to force poison into the insects they catch for food. This poison can make an insect lose the ability to move, and the helpless insect is then _ by the spider. Spiders usually have silk glands under their abdomen. They produce a liquid that is thicker than water from their glands. When the liquid comes into the air, it dries into silk. Many spiders use this silk to form webs to catch insects and to make cocoons that protect their eggs. This amazing silk is also used to create lines that spiders hang onto as they travel to new areas. Spiders live in almost everywhere on earth. The only places where there are no spiders are the coldest places, the highest mountains and the seas. According to the passage, which of the following is WRONG? A) Spiders are not insects. B) All spiders have poison glands. C) Spiders make cocoons to keep their eggs safe. D) There are no spiders in the coldest places. Answer:","output":"B) All spiders have poison glands. Although most spiders have poison glands, it is not accurate to say that all spiders have them. There are some spider species that do not possess venom glands, and they use other methods to catch and subdue their prey. For example, the Uloboridae family of spiders lack venom glands completely and use their specialized silk instead to immobilize their prey.

What same word can be a word for theatrical scenery, a list of songs performed at a concert or a sequence of legs in darts?","output":"The word that can be used to describe theatrical scenery, a list of songs performed at a concert, or a sequence of legs in a darts game is 'set'. As a highly versatile word in English language, 'set' has several definitions depending on the context in which it's used. 1. 'Set' in Theatrical Scenery: In theatre, a 'set' refers to the environment in which the action of the play occurs. This might include physical structures on the stage, such as buildings or interiors, as well as more abstract or symbolic elements like lighting and sound. The set works to support the world of the play, helping to convey setting, mood, and character. The design, fabrication, and arrangement of set pieces is a key aspect of stagecraft and is often overseen by a dedicated set designer or team of designers. 2. 'Set' in Music: In the context of a concert or musical performance, a 'set' typically refers to a pre-determined list of songs to be played by the band or artist. This set list serves as a roadmap for the performance, allowing musicians to structure their show, control the pace and flow of the concert, and ensure that they cover all of the material they intend to perform. The ordering of songs within a set can have a significant impact on the audience's experience, potentially heightening emotional engagement or building anticipation for fan-favorite tracks. 3. 'Set' in Darts: In a darts game, a 'set' refers to a sequence of legs, which are individual games within a match. Essentially, each game is one leg and a set is a collection of these games. The numbers of legs in a set can vary, but commonly there are best of 5 or best of 7 legs in a set. The player or team that wins a predetermined number of these sets faster than their opponent wins the match. This system allows for clear, incremental progress within the larger structure of the darts match. The versatility of the word 'set' illustrates the richness of English vocabulary, where single words can carry multiple meanings across a variety of different contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A silver dress is already a bold fashion move, and adding a loud necklace will only make your outfit seem unnecessarily gaudy. Your necklace should not compete with your dress.  If sticking with silver or silver and gold, a dainty chain with a simple pendant works nicely, depending on your dress’s neckline. For an appropriately bolder look, wear a necklace with chunky black or blue beads mixed with gunmetal. It can be a choker or a long loop that drapes across your torso. A delicate silver or two-toned chain bracelet adds a touch of class. Thin silver bangles are festive yet feminine. A thick, chunky bracelet in black, gunmetal, or deep blue adds contrast to your dress but avoids clashing or competing with it. Earrings can add just enough sparkle by your face to help correct the potential imbalance caused by having too much silver concentrated on the middle of your body. Choose the right posts, hoops, or dangling earrings to match your color scheme. Sparkly, decorative hair clips can either be playful or elegant, depending on the design. These, like earrings, can also help balance out the silver on your body.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. On Wednesday, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in my case challenging the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, widely known as DOMA. I was honored and humbled by the opportunity to have my case considered by our nation's highest court. I have also been overwhelmed by the love and support I have received from people all across the country. To be honest, I never could have imagined that this day would come -- the day that I would be \\"out\\" as an 83-year-old lesbian suing the federal government. My late wife, Thea Spyer, was, and is, the love of my life. Although we couldn't live openly for much of our relationship, we became engaged in 1967 with a circular diamond brooch that symbolized the rings we weren't able to wear on our fingers. And we stayed engaged for the next 40 years, caring for each other, sharing all the joys and sorrows that came our way. Victory years after longtime partner's death. We lived through good times -- with jobs that we loved, great friends and a lot of dancing. But we also depended on each other for strength through the vicissitudes of aging and illness. In 1977, Thea was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis, which became debilitating over time. First, she had to use one cane, then two crutches, then a wheelchair. In Thea's last years, she was quadriplegic. We were lucky that the MS never affected her brilliant mind or her cognition, and that she was able to continue seeing patients as a psychologist until the day that she died. In 2007, we learned from Thea's doctors that she had only one year to live. When we realized that we were running out of time, we decided to marry in Canada. That marriage was recognized in our home state of New York. We wanted to be married for the same reason most people want to marry: to publicly and legally express our love and commitment to one another. When our wedding announcement ran in The New York Times, we heard from hundreds of people from every stage of our lives -- playmates and schoolmates, colleagues, friends and relatives -- pouring out love and congratulations because we were married. That's why marriage is different -- it's a magic word recognized by everyone as a demonstration of commitment and love. When my beautiful Thea died two years later, I was overcome with grief. Over the next month, I was hospitalized with a heart attack, and, in the midst of my grief, I realized that the federal government would not recognize our marriage. DOMA restricts federal marriage benefits and state-to-state recognition of marriages only to unions between a man and a woman. Because of DOMA, I was required to pay 363,000 in federal estate taxes that I would not have had to pay had I been married to a man instead of Thea. This was not only painful, it was wrong. I knew that Thea would want me to stand up for our marriage -- and for so many other gay couples and their families who are harmed by this unjust law. I believe that all marriages should be treated equally by the federal government in accordance with the Constitution. We won our case in two lower courts, and have now made it all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States -- which is a monumental feat in itself. I know that Thea's spirit was with us Wednesday at the oral argument. But our journey is not yet over. If, through my case, our story can help to ensure that the federal government treats all marriages equally, that will be the best possible final chapter in our love story.

UPDATED:. 08:40 EST, 1 October 2013. A respected cancer specialist killed a 21-year-old cyclist who was on a bike ride with her boyfriend while driving on the bend of a road, a jury heard today. Dr Helen Measures told the jury how she overtook two cyclists in her red Mini only to drive into the path of two more riders coming from the opposite direction. She collided with waitress Denisa Perinova, who was out on a bike ride with her new boyfriend. Cyclist Denisa Perinova (left) died after colliding with the car of Dr Helen Measures (right), a jury heard. Miss Perinova, originally from the Czech Republic, allegedly lost control of her £300 second-hand bike, which was bought for her by her boyfriend, Ben Pontin, just four days before. She was flung 15 yards from the seat of her new racing bike and, despite wearing a helmet, died in hospital from severe head injuries a week later, the Oxford Crown Court jury was told. Measures, who has a doctorate in oncology and has worked as a scientist for leading pharmaceutical companies for the past 30 years, has denied causing Miss Perinova’s death by careless driving. A keen cyclist herself, she told the court: 'I can’t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I’m approaching them and comes into my line of travel.' The 51-year-old divorced mother-of-four said she was travelling back from a garden centre to her home in Pishill, near Henley-on-Thames, at 40-50mph on July 15 last year. She was with her four-year-old daughter and her long-term boyfriend. The former parish church bell ringer said she had not seen the cyclists coming from the other direction when she overtook, and thought there was 'sufficient room' to make the manoeuvre. Measures said she was 'surprised' to see Mr Pontin and his girlfriend coming towards her as she rounded the curve in the road - but felt they still had enough room to get past. 'I don’t know why I didn’t see them,' she said. 'I had to make a decision of what to do. I felt the safest decision was to continue straight ahead because they were in single file. 'If I had been concerned, I would have stopped suddenly.' Mr Pontin had earlier told the jury he saw Measures make a 'stupid manoeuvre' in front of them on a bend in the A415. Describing the moment the oncoming car overtook the cyclists on the opposite side of the road, he said: 'I just couldn’t believe the person driving had overtaken at that point.' Miss Perinova, shown here with her parents and younger brother, died after the collision in July 2012. Mr Pontin said he was forced to aim for a 'tiny' gap and then felt his girlfriend’s wheel touch the back of his bike before looking around and seeing she had been flung 15 yards away in the collision. Her body lay motionless at the entrance to a field. Her helmet was smashed, and Mr Pontin said it was unclear whether she had been struck by the defendant’s Mini. Miss Perinova was initially rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, in Reading, before being transferred to a specialist neurological unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where she later died. Taking to the stand, Measures, who has previously been on family cycling holidays, said she did not have a chance to break. She said the first cyclist, Mr Pontin, went past her. However, Miss Perinova came at her at 'right angles' after losing control of her bike. In a heated exchange at Oxford Crown Court, Measures was challenged by prosecutor Sandra Beck, who said: 'You are relying on other road users avoiding you when you are on their side of the road?' Measures replied: 'I can’t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I’m approaching them and comes into my line of travel. 'I would expect cyclists to generally remain upright as the first cyclist did and went past. 'When I looked, it was sufficiently clear not to stop me doing that manoeuvre. 'You do not make a manoeuvre if you don’t think it is safe to do so. 'Had everyone stayed upright, there would not have been an issue. 'I had my daughter in the car. I do not drive without due care and attention.' The trial, before Judge Patrick Eccles, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

Study A explained how increased greenhouse gases would affect the climate. On the other hand, study B showed how decreased greenhouse gases would affect the climate. Rob found the studies very interesting.  But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  What is an answer for this question: Would study B see less or more wildlife population than study A? A:","output":"Based on the provided background and understanding of the situation, Study A focuses on the effects of increased greenhouse gases on the climate, which would likely lead to more severe global warming. This increase in global warming results in the destruction of natural habitats and a subsequent reduction in wildlife population. Study B, on the other hand, addresses the impact of decreased greenhouse gases on the climate. This would imply that the effects of global warming would be less severe, potentially slowing down the destruction of habitats and allowing for a more stable environment for wildlife populations.  Therefore, it can be concluded that Study B would likely see a higher wildlife population compared to Study A, since it investigates the potential benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and alleviating some of the negative consequences of climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners. Sound & Vision critic Brent Butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments, rock and funk drumming, and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre's fans...

As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment.

Given the below context:  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

Once a coach has identified potential recruits, they begin reviewing these athletes more closely. They will verify your highlight reel and your statistics with your club and high school coaches. They will also verify your high school transcript with your school. At this stage it is important to have all of your information organized. Coaches want to see that potential recruits are taking this process seriously and are able to follow up with them with the information that they request. This is the stage where coaches or the recruiters they work with will come to watch you play. They may invite you on official or unofficial visits of the university and contact your family members.   Coaches want to see that you are an upstanding young person who is responsible, a team player, committed to soccer, and interested in their university. During this time, you will need to spend time visiting the schools and meeting other players on the team. Continue to build your relationship with the college coach and emphasize that you are very interested in playing for them. Coaches that are interested in offering you a scholarship at this stage will extend verbal or formal written commitments. Depending on the school, you may receive this offer through your high school or club coach. You may have room to negotiate the terms of the offer but you should review them carefully. Read over each offer very carefully with your parents and coaches. There may be terms for the offer, like maintaining a certain grade point average or participating in a training camp before school starts, that you have to understand and follow. Unless you are a top recruit at one of the best Division I schools, you will probably be unable to negotiate any offer you receive. If there are some specific terms that you can negotiate, proceed cautiously. Teams have been known to pull offers from athletes that they believe to be too pushy or disrespectful. If you receive multiple offers, you may be able to leverage one offer against another. Keep in mind that some schools will offer a scholarship for a specific amount, like 20,000 each year, or a percentage, like 50% of tuition. A coach that offers you the highest amount, even if it is not a full ride, is unlikely to up their offer when they hear that schools are offering you less money. Congratulations!

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the actual person who began composing songs in a distinctive, original style on his return to England in 1918? , can you please find it?   Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented involves the person having a compromised immune system and its potential effect on the occurrence of more/more powerful lightning. However, there is no direct or indirect correlation between an individual's immune system and the natural atmospheric processes that result in lightning.  To reiterate the process of lightning formation, it occurs due to the separation of electrical charges within a cloud. As small ice particles collide with each other, they cause a build-up of electrical energy. Positively charged particles accumulate at the bottom of the cloud, and negatively charged particles gather at the top. When the charge difference becomes significant enough, lightning ensues as a discharge of this accumulated electrical energy. In summary, a person's immune system has no bearing on the formation or intensity of lightning, as lightning is a natural atmospheric phenomenon caused by the separation of electrical charges within a cloud.

Translate this to English?","output":"A week ago, we mentioned the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but today we also have to acknowledge that many states not only fail to comply with human rights, but blatantly violate them. In this statement, the author is reflecting on the significance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which is a historic document that sets out fundamental rights and freedoms for all individuals. The UDHR was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948, and its 60th anniversary marks an important milestone in the global recognition and protection of human rights. However, the author acknowledges the unfortunate reality that many countries around the world continue to disregard and actively violate these basic rights. Despite the international community's ongoing efforts to hold accountable those who violate human rights, it remains a challenge to ensure the fair treatment and recognition of every individual's inherent rights. The UDHR itself consists of 30 articles, which enumerate various rights and protections afforded to all human beings, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, or other distinctions. These rights cover various aspects of life, from civil and political rights like freedom of speech and assembly to social and economic rights such as the entitlement to work and education. Nonetheless, human rights abuses persist in many countries, often taking the form of oppressive government action, discrimination, and violence against marginalized communities, denial of basic services and opportunities, and the undermining of democratic institutions. These violations are not only a grave injustice at the individual level but also impede the global progress towards a more equitable and inclusive society. In order to address this critical issue, multiple organizations and initiatives have been established, including the United Nations Human Rights Council, numerous non-governmental organizations (NGOs), national human rights institutions, and ratification of various treaties and conventions. These actors work together to monitor, report, and respond to human rights abuses, as well as to promote awareness, education, and advocacy to improve the overall human rights situation worldwide. While much progress has been made since the adoption of the UDHR, there is still a long way to go in terms of fully realizing the vision of a world where everyone's human rights are respected and protected. By acknowledging the ongoing challenges, as well as the achievements made so far, we can continue to work towards eradicating human rights abuses and building a better, more just future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Snakes on a Plane Movie plot: After witnessing gangster Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We have the equation: 68949*o + 1303 = 68692*o - 496 Step 1: Let's find out the difference in the number of o's on both sides. So, subtract 68692*o from both sides: (68949*o - 68692*o) + 1303 = -496 Step 2: Now, let's do the subtraction of the o's. We get: (68949 - 68692)*o + 1303 = -496 That leaves us with: 257*o + 1303 = -496 Step 3: We need to isolate o, so we'll move everything not attached to o to the other side. Let's subtract 1303 from both sides: 257*o = -496 - 1303 Step 4: Now, let's do that subtraction. We get: 257*o = -1799 Step 5: Finally, we need to find out the value of o. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 257: o = -1799 ÷ 257 When we do that division, we find that:  o = -7 So, the value of o is -7!

Edmund Burke (1729-1797), an Irish political philosopher, was a strong advocate of parliamentary democracy and a keen observer of the very significant political and social changes happening during his time. Richard Price's sermon, a well-known Unitarian minister, and philosopher, had a profound effect on Burke. Price praised the French Revolution and ardently advocated for the cause of liberty and human rights. He delivered a sermon that became well-known, titled \\"A Discourse on the Love of Our Country.\\" This particular sermon acted as a catalytic moment for Burke, instigating him to pen down his thoughts and reactions on the French Revolution. Simultaneously, it triggered a debate between those who supported the revolution and those who saw it as something profoundly threatening.  As mentioned in the statement, Burke wrote a draft in response to Price's sermon, which finally culminated in his masterpiece, \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France.\\" Published in 1790, this work was a direct response to Price's sermon and the events that were unfolding in France at the time. \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\" is a thorough and comprehensive critique of the French Revolution, which Edmund Burke views as being fueled by abstract, metaphysical ideas while lacking a proper understanding of the historical and social realities. In conclusion, the statement provided accurately answers the question, and the appropriate response from the options given would be option 1: Yes. Price's sermon was the catalyst for Burke's writing of \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France,\\" a pivotal work that sparked considerable debate on the revolution and its consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, I will highlight the pros and cons of the app to provide a balanced and fair review. Review: Title: \\"Decent tool for sheet music enthusiasts, but could use some improvements\\" Rating: 3 out of 5 stars As a musician who frequently works with sheet music, I was excited to try out the app com.midisheetmusic. Though the app does have a few redeeming qualities, it also has some drawbacks that left me wanting more. On the positive side, the app has a simple and clean user interface, and it is quite easy to navigate. The in-app library of MIDI files is a great feature, allowing users to access and play various pieces on the go. Additionally, the zooming and scrolling controls make it convenient to move through the sheet music. However, on the downside, the app's performance could use some improvements. At times, the sheet music rendering was slow and sluggish, which affected my overall experience. Moreover, the app was missing some important features, such as the ability to edit and annotate the sheet music, as well as the option to synchronize it with an external audio source. This limits the functionality of the app and could be a dealbreaker for some users. In conclusion, the com.midisheetmusic app serves as a decent tool for sheet music enthusiasts but falls short of providing the complete package. Although it is beneficial for accessing and playing sheet music on the go, the app's current limitations make it challenging to utilize as a professional tool.

Scott Applewhite, File) (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the dismissal of Andrew McCabe, a former FBI deputy director, and the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election (all times local):      9:30 a.m.      President Donald Trump is reviving concerns that the special counsel team investigating Russian election interference may be biased against him.      Trump tweeted Sunday: \\"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\\"      The tweet marks one of the first times that Trump has mentioned special counsel Robert Mueller by name.      Trump allies previously have questioned whether Mueller can lead an unbiased probe because some of his investigators have made campaign contributions to Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton. Mueller is a former FBI director appointed by Republican President George W. Bush.      Other Trump backers have noted that Mueller interviewed with Trump to serve another term as FBI director. Trump instead nominated Christopher Wray to lead the bureau.      ___      8:35 a.m.      President Donald Trump is raising doubts about whether former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe kept personal memos outlining McCabe's interactions with the president.      McCabe was fired Friday by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Associated Press is reporting that McCabe's memos have been provided to special counsel Robert Mueller, who's investigating possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.

The AP reports that the memos are similar to the notes compiled by Comey, who was fired last year as FBI director.      McCabe's memos could factor into Mueller's investigation as his team examines Trump campaign ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice.      McCabe's memos include details of his own interactions with the president. They also recount different conversations he had with Comey, who kept notes on meetings with Trump.

Here's a detailed explanation for each choice: [a]. A fish in the pond would not be interested in acorns, as they generally consume food that is found in their aquatic environment. Common food sources for fish include insects, plankton, algae, and other aquatic organisms. Acorns would not be a part of their natural diet, and they would not be physically able to leave the pond to retrieve the bag of acorns. [b]. A dog in the house could potentially be curious about the bag of acorns on the playground, but it would not be the most likely creature to take it. While dogs sometimes eat plant-based foods, most dogs primarily consume meat or other protein sources. Also, considering the dog is in the house, it would have less opportunity to access the bag of acorns compared to an animal that is already outdoors. [c]. A stray local chipmunk would be the most probable candidate to take the bag of acorns. Chipmunks are known to eat acorns, and this food source forms a significant part of their diet. Chipmunks also have a strong instinct to gather and store food, particularly nuts and seeds, to prepare for winter. Additionally, assuming the playground is located within the chipmunk's habitat or near wooded areas, the chipmunk would have easy access to the acorns. [d]. A tiger in the zoo would have no interest in the bag of acorns, as they are carnivorous animals with a diet primarily consisting of meats. Furthermore, if a tiger were in a zoo, it would not have direct access to the playground to take the bag of acorns. The zoo enclosure and caretakers would prevent the tiger from leaving its designated area, making it impossible for the tiger to retrieve the bag of acorns on the playground. In conclusion, considering the fact that chipmunks eat acorns, the most likely scenario is that a stray local chipmunk would take the bag of acorns left on the playground. The other options listed either have no interest in acorns, live in an environment where they could not access the bag, or are under restrictions that prevent them from retrieving it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following guide aims to simplify this process by providing step-by-step instructions and valuable suggestions. So, let's delve into the details and bring you closer to finding that special someone. Step 1: Identify Your Needs and Desires The first step to discovering your ideal match is determining what you want in a relationship. Reflect on your long-term goals, values, and preferences. Do you envision a committed partnership or something more casual? Are shared interests essential, or do you appreciate unique perspectives? Determining what you genuinely desire in a boyfriend will serve as your compass, guiding you in your journey. Step 2: Acknowledge Your Genuine Intentions Before diving into the dating world, honestly assess whether you are genuinely seeking a boyfriend or just filling a void in your life. Pursuing a relationship for the sake of companionship can lead to dissatisfaction and eventually emotional turmoil. Ensure that your motivations are rooted in a genuine desire to connect and share your life with someone special. Step 3: Look for Open-Minded Men An essential criterion during your search is finding a man who is receptive to a same-sex relationship. Mutual understanding and acceptance will foster a healthy, supportive partnership. Focus on people who are open-minded and embrace diversity so that you can be your authentic self in the relationship. Step 4: Tap into Your Social Circle You never know who might know someone perfect for you. Talk to friends, family members, and colleagues, asking if they can introduce you to someone who might be a good match. This connection may already be within your social circle, and a personal recommendation can go a long way in sealing the deal. Step 5: Explore Social Media Platforms Social media is a powerful tool for meeting new people, especially during this digital era. Utilize various platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, to broaden your horizons. Join groups, participate in discussions, and interact with others who share your interests. Be open to forming new connections, as they could potentially lead to your ideal partner. Step 6: Try Online Dating Services Online dating websites and apps have revolutionized the way we connect with potential romantic partners. Tailored specifically for gay men, platforms like Grindr, SCRUFF, and OkCupid offer extensive options for meeting people who share your interests. Create an attractive profile, be honest and clear about your intentions, and engage in meaningful conversations to locate the one you desire. Conclusion Finding your ideal boyfriend as a gay man may take time, but with determination and patience, you can successfully navigate the dating world. Focus on understanding your preferences, embrace the opportunities presented by social media and online dating services, and maintain a positive attitude throughout the journey. Your special someone might just be around the corner.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where were sixty thousand more were sold in 2005? ?  The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost.  However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US19,572,000.Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network.  Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas.  There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold.

In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

As they reach the jetty, the youngest members of the quartet, Karin (Harriet Andersson) and her teenage brother, Fredrik, known as Minus (Lars Passgard), are sent off to get some milk at a nearby farm, while Karin's physician husband, Martin (Max von Sydow), and her father, David (Gunnar Bjorstrand), a writer, go and set up their fishing nets. David has just returned from Switzerland, where he was finishing writing his latest novel, and their task gives them a private opportunity to discuss Karin's status, whose schizophrenia has been diagnosed as most likely incurable.On the way to the farm, Minus expresses his hope that their father will be successful with his latest novel's publication. On the way back, Minus confides in his sister his sexual apprehensions, which eventually degenerates into his admonishment of Karin for the (maybe) too intimate attention she keeps showing toward him. But most importantly, he confesses how much he wishes he could communicate with his father.The quartet is reunited for the evening dinner around a table in front of their cottage. Again, a festive atmosphere prevails, but soon turns sour. David confesses that while he was anxious to return to his family after his long absence, that he is about to leave again, in spite of his earlier promise to his children not to travel so often. Somewhat guiltily, and seeking forgiveness, David distributes some presents, all of them turning out to be unsuitable. He goes into the house under the pretense of getting his pipe tobacco, but it is only to release his pent-up anguish at... Answer:","output":"David"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's important to drink eight to 10 8-ounce glasses of water a day. This keeps the discharge thin and more fluid, making it easier to drain.","output":"Chronic sinusitis is a common condition where the cavities around nasal passages (sinuses) become inflamed and swollen for at least 12 weeks, despite treatment attempts. Treating chronic sinusitis is essential to alleviate discomfort, ensure proper sinus function, and prevent complications. In addition to drinking eight to 10 glasses of water a day, there is a range of other treatments and recommendations that can help manage and, ideally, resolve this condition.  1. Medical treatment: Seek advice from your healthcare professional regarding appropriate medications to alleviate symptoms and address any infections. This may include:    - Nasal corticosteroids: These nasal sprays can help reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms.    - Saline nasal irrigation: A saltwater solution can be used to clear the nasal passages and reduce congestion.    - Oral or injected corticosteroids: In severe cases, physicians may prescribe oral or injected corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.    - Antibiotics: If a bacterial infection is present, your doctor may suggest antibiotics for treatment.    - Antifungal medications: In cases of fungal infections, antifungal medication may be prescribed. 2. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications: Some OTC medications, such as decongestants or antihistamines, can help relieve symptoms. However, long-term use may cause side effects. Consult your healthcare provider before starting any OTC medications. 3. Lifestyle changes and home remedies:    - Use a humidifier: Adding moisture to the air can help to soothe irritated nasal passages and reduce sinus congestion.    - Practice good hygiene: Regular handwashing and avoiding contact with individuals who have colds or respiratory infections can reduce the risk of sinus infections.    - Avoid irritants: Tobacco smoke, pollution, or allergens can worsen sinusitis symptoms, so try to minimize exposure to these irritants.    - Apply warm compresses: Warm compresses applied to the face can help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.    - Refrain from alcohol consumption: Alcohol can worsen sinusitis symptoms by contributing to dehydration and increasing sinus inflammation. 4. Allergy management: If you have allergies, leading to chronic sinusitis, consider working with an allergist or immunologist. Immunotherapy, allergy shots, or oral sublingual tablets can help desensitize your immune system to specific allergens and reduce symptoms. 5. Alternative therapies: Some individuals find relief from chronic sinusitis through alternative therapies such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, or homeopathy. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before starting any alternative treatment. 6. Surgical intervention: In cases where conservative treatments don't help or when structural abnormalities are contributing to chronic sinusitis, surgery may be necessary. Endoscopic sinus surgery involves removing obstructions or correcting structural issues to improve sinus drainage and function. It is essential to work with a healthcare professional to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your specific needs and circumstances. In addition, maintaining a healthy lifestyle by staying hydrated, managing stress, exercising, and focusing on a balanced diet can also improve your body's ability to manage chronic sinusitis. Remember that addressing chronic sinusitis might take some time, and treatment may need to be adjusted to find the most effective combination of therapies for you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

President Barack Obama's choice for the No. 2 job at the Homeland Security Department is under investigation for his role in helping a company run by Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony Rodham. Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is being investigated for his role in helping the company secure an international investor visa for a Chinese executive, according to congressional officials briefed on the investigation. Anthony Rodham is president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC in McLean, Va. Under investigation: Alejandro Mayorkas, who is being probed, (pictured far right) stood with President Obama and Director of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano (center) in March 2013 at the White House. The officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details of the investigation. Mayorkas was named by Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office as a target in an investigation involving the foreign investor program run by USCIS, according to an email sent to lawmakers late Monday, Associated Press has learned. In that email, the IG's office said,'At this point in our investigation, we do not have any findings of criminal misconduct.' The email did not specify any criminal allegations it might be investigating. White House press secretary Jay Carney referred questions to the inspector general's office, which said that the probe is in its preliminary stage and that it doesn't comment on the specifics of investigations. The program, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to get visas if they invest 500,000 to 1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for U.S. citizens. The amount of the investment required depends on the type of project. Investors who are approved for the program can become legal permanent residents after two years and can later be eligible to become citizens. Clinton connections: Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony Rodham (pictured right with his bride Nicole Boxer in 1999) is president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC in McLean, Va. If Mayorkas were confirmed as Homeland Security's deputy secretary, he probably would run the department until a permanent replacement was approved to take over for departing Secretary Janet Napolitano. The email to lawmakers said the primary complaint against Mayorkas was that he helped a financing company run by Anthony Rodham, a brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton, to win approval for an investor visa, even after the application was denied and an appeal was rejected. Mayorkas, a former U.S. attorney in California, previously came under criticism for his involvement in the commutation by President Bill Clinton of the prison sentence of the son of a Democratic Party donor. Another of Hillary Clinton's brothers, Hugh Rodham, had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. Mayorkas told lawmakers during his 2009 confirmation hearing that 'it was a mistake' to talk to the White House about the request. Hillary Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state on Feb. 1, is considered a possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. According to the Inspector General's email, the investigation of the investor visa program also includes allegations that other USCIS Office of General Counsel officials obstructed an audit of the visa program by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The email did not name any specific official from the general counsel's office. Family ties: Another of Hillary Clinton's brothers, Hugh Rodham (pictured with Bill Clinton in 1999) had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. The email says investigators did not know whether Mayorkas was aware of the investigation. The FBI's Washington Field Office was told about the investigation in June after it inquired about Mayorkas as part of the White House background investigation for his nomination as deputy DHS secretary. The FBI in Washington has been concerned about the investor visa program and the projects funded by foreign sources since at least March, according to emails obtained by The AP. The bureau wanted details of all of the limited liability companies that had invested in the EB-5 visa program. Of particular concern, the FBI official wrote, was Chinese investment in projects, including the building of an FBI facility. 'Let's just say that we have a significant issue that my higher ups are really concerned about and this may be addressed way above my pay grade,' an official wrote in one email. The FBI official's name was redacted in that email. Appointed by Obama: Alejandro Mayorkas is director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent the FBI a lengthy letter Tuesday asking for details of its review of the foreign investor visa program and Chinese investment in U.S. infrastructure projects. Chinese investment in infrastructure projects has long been a concern of the U.S. government. In September, the Obama administration blocked a Chinese company from owning four wind farm projects in northern Oregon that were near a Navy base used to fly unmanned drones and electronic-warfare planes on training missions. And in October, the House Intelligence Committee warned that two leading Chinese technology firms, Huawei Technologies Ltd. and ZTE Corp., posed a major security threat to the U.S. Both firms have denied being influenced by the Chinese government. The most routine users of the EB-5 program are Chinese investors. According to an undated, unclassified State Department report about the program obtained by the AP, the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China, processed more investor visas in the 2011 fiscal year than any other consulate or embassy. The document says 'applicants are usually coached and prepped for their interviews, making it difficult to take at face value applicants' claims' about where their money comes from and whether they hold membership in the Chinese Communist Party. Party membership would make an applicant ineligible for the investor visa. Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC is one of hundreds of 'Regional Centers' that pool investments from foreign nationals looking to invest in U.S. businesses or industries as part of the foreign investor visa program. There was no immediate response to an email sent to Gulf Coast requesting comment. It is unclear from the IG's email why the investor visa application was denied. Visa requests can be denied for a number of reasons, including a circumstance where an applicant has a criminal background or is considered a threat to national security or public safety.

Now, US scientists have discovered not only does retail therapy exist,but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. Researchers found materialistic people thought terrorism and war more stressful than others. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its treatment effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. The scientists from Michigan State University said people with possession obsessions often have lower self-esteem than others so are more likely to shop as the result of severe psychological suffering. Ayalla Ruvio,a business professor studying people's shopping habits while rockets fell in Israel, said, \\"When the going gets tough, the materialistic people go shopping. This stress spending is likely to produce even greater stress and lower well-being. Essentially, materialism appears to make bad events even worse. Dr Ruvio led a two-part study of Israeli citizens living in a town that came under extreme rocket attacks for about six months in 2007. She compared 139 residents of the southern town with 170 from another town that was not under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. Dr Ruvio found that, when faced with a deadly threat, those who are highly materialistic suffered much higher levels of stress,while their tendency to shop was increased. Dr Ruvio said, \\"The relationship between materialism and stress may be more harmful than commonly thought.\\" The second stage of their research surveyed 855 Americans about their materialistic nature and fear of death. They found shopping was used to relieve feelings of stress and anxiety about death but this was in response to fear of a variety of life-threatening events like car accidents, criminal attacks and natural disasters.

Mary had an arrogant professor. Mary's accounting class had started off on a rocky note. Unlike Felicia, who was enjoying her time in school and felt motivated in her class, Mary was struggling to keep up with the material her instructor presented. It wasn't that Mary couldn't understand accounting or that she wasn't smart enough - it was simply because her professor was making things difficult. Step 1: Highlight the challenges faced by Mary because of her arrogant professor. --- Mary's professor, Mr. Johnson, displayed a high degree of arrogance. He believed that he was the ultimate authority on accounting and that no one else's input or questions had any value. Whenever Mary or her classmates asked questions in class, Mr. Johnson would dismiss them as irrelevant or not important. He refused to provide further clarification when asked to explain complex concepts, making it difficult for the students to comprehend the subject matter. Step 2: Show how the situation affects Mary's confidence and performance. --- Mary's confidence began to falter under his sardonic remarks and dismissive attitude. As the semester progressed, Mary found herself dreading the class and losing her passion for accounting. She started avoiding asking questions, even when she didn't understand certain topics, for fear of being belittled in front of her peers. Consequently, Mary's overall class performance began to suffer. Step 3: Introduce a moment of hope or an opportunity for Mary to overcome the challenges. --- One day, after another humiliating encounter with Mr. Johnson in class, Mary decided to approach Felicia for help. Feeling vulnerable, she opened up to her friend about her struggles and sought advice. Felicia, being the kind and supportive friend that she was, decided to assist Mary by sharing her notes and study techniques. Step 4: Show how Mary's hard work and determination pay off. --- With Felicia's unwavering support, Mary started studying harder than ever before. She practiced accounting problems for hours on end, determined to understand and apply the concepts she had missed. She refused to let Mr. Johnson's arrogance hinder her growth and love for accounting. Step 5: Demonstrate the resolution or achievement by Mary. --- Eventually, Mary's hard work paid off. Despite Mr. Johnson's arrogance and unhelpful demeanor, she managed to grasp the material and excel in her studies. When the final exams came, Mary not only passed the course but scored one of the highest marks in her class. In the end, Mary overcame the challenges posed by her arrogant professor and reaffirmed her passion for accounting. This experience taught her that she could overcome any obstacle, even those created by the most formidable of adversaries, as long as she believed in herself and had the right support system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: The American Medical Association may throw its clout behind sales and advertising bans of “high-energy/stimulant drinks” to young people under age 18, pending more scientific study about health risks.      A debate schedule for this weekend by the AMA’s policy-making House of Delegates comes amid intensifying scrutiny of energy drinks, which are popular particularly among young adults who get a boost from caffeine and other ingredients in the beverages.      But a resolution from the New York State Medical Society that will be discussed at this year’s annual AMA meeting in Chicago cites an increase in emergency room visits the physicians said was “linked to the consumption of ‘stimulant’ drinks.” Doctors have also cited probes like that of the New York State Attorney General’s investigation into drink makers that include Monster Beverage Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST) and PepsiCo PepsiCo Inc. (PEP).      Though any action this weekend by the AMA’s policy-making House of Delegates has no legal authority over the sale of high-energy drinks, the national doctor’s group has a bully pulpit on public health issues. The AMA is also considered a powerful lobby in Washington and in state capitols across the county where it holds sway when it comes to medical policy and health regulations.      “The popularity of stimulant drinks has increased markedly in recent years with sales increasing 240 percent from 2004-2009, with further data indicating that these drinks are consumed by 30 to 50 percent of children, adolescents, and young adults,” the New York delegation to the AMA House of delegates said in its resolution. “Studies have shown that high ‘stimulant’ drinks contain excessive amounts of caffeine with one can having the equivalent of up to 50 cups of coffee. Excessive caffeine can cause adverse effects such as dizziness, insomnia, agitation, restlessness, anxiety, GI disturbances, myocardial infarction and death.”      Any push by the AMA could meet resistance from drink makers.      Monster, for example, earlier this year has fought back against curbs on sales of its drinks such as a suit it filed against the San Francisco City Attorney this spring. Monster has also said labeling on its drinks caution that the beverages are “not recommended for children, pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine,” according to an April report in the Wall Street Journal linked here.      The resolution regarding energy drinks is among dozens that will be debated at the AMA’s 524-member House of Delegates, which convenes Saturday to Wednesday at the Hyatt Regency Chicago.      Aside from endorsing a ban on such drinks, AMA delegates are also pushing for more scientific study of energy drinks.      On June 18, the AMA’s policy-making House of Delegates adopted policy supporting a ban on the marketing, but not on the sale of “high stimulant/caffeine drinks to adolescents under the age of 18. Here’s a link to AMA statement on the new policy.      Said AMA board member Dr. Alexander Ding, “Energy drinks contain massive and excessive amounts of caffeine that may lead to a host of health problems in young people, including heart problems, and banning companies from marketing these products to adolescents is a common sense action that we can take to protect the health of American kids.” ||||| Doctors To Vote On Whether Cheerleading Is A Sport      Enlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP      This weekend the American Medical Association will kick off its annual exercise in medical democracy.      The group's House of Delegates will meet in Chicago to vote on resolutions that range from a demand that private insurers pay doctors at least as much as Medicare does to a call for federal legislation affirming the right of doctors to talk about gun safety with patients.      Oh, and one other thing, the Illinois delegation is putting forward a resolution asking the AMA to \\"support the designation of cheerleading as a sport.\\"      Yep, you read that right. And the health logic is pretty straightforward, actually.      Cheerleading has become a competitive activity in its own right, and there's a considerable risk of serious injury, including concussion, spinal damage and broken bones.      What Should The AMA Do? Should cheerleading be considered a sport?      So it ought to get the same attention to health consequences as other sports, including the training of coaches to minimize injury risks for cheerleaders, proponents say.      A 2011 report from the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research found that \\"high school and college cheerleaders account for approximately two-thirds of the catastrophic injuries to female athletes.\\"      The NCAA hasn't recognized cheerleading as a competitive sport. Last August, a federal appeals court ruled that Quinnipiac College in Connecticut couldn't count cheerleading as a sport under Title IX as way to offset disbanding women's volleyball.      If the AMA delegates go along with the proposal, they'll be following in the footsteps of the pediatricians. Last October, The American Academy of Pediatrics called for more attention to cheerleading injuries and giving the go-ahead to the sports label. ||||| Summary:","output":"The American Medical Association (AMA) has been discussing the possibility of supporting sales and advertising bans of high-energy and stimulant drinks to young people under the age of 18, citing the need for further scientific study on the potential health risks associated with these beverages.

They argue that by tightening the belt now, Latvia can bolster its economic outlook by controlling expanding national debt and paving the way for a stronger economy in the future. Advocates also point out that Latvia has no other plausible choice to escape the downward spiral of economic collapse; international lenders like the International Monetary Fund or the European Union can only provide conditional aid, typically contingent upon such severe fiscal restraints. On the flip side, critics argue that such severe cuts risk exacerbating the recession and deepening social inequity. They warn that the ongoing contraction of the Latvian economy – most acutely represented by the increasing unemployment, wage reduction, and escalation of poverty – could precipitate a deeper, longer economic downturn that may push Latvia into a near-depression state. Critics contend that such austerity measures would disproportionately affect the most vulnerable groups of society, escalating wealth disparity and social inequity.  Some political commentators have voiced concern over the potential implications for the nation's social fabric and political stability. By imposing deeper cuts, there's a risk of fanning social unrest and exacerbating discontent amongst the populace, which could lead to even more significant problems in the long run.  The government, however, appears resolute in its decision to implement further cuts, arguing that the alternative—defaulting on its debts—would have catastrophic implications not just for Latvia, but for the global financial system as a whole. Thus, despite the mounting social, economic, and political pressure, Latvia remains fixed in its contemplation of deeper cuts, reflecting the sheer severity of the crisis it faces. In conclusion, while the Latvian government's move to implement deeper cuts in response to its ongoing economic crisis is a clear testament to the severity of the situation, it also opens up a larger discussion about the ramifications of such measures on the social and economic fabric of the country, an issue that will likely continue to reverberate far into Latvia's future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:The Jones family and the Bell family both entered a medical study for diabetes.The members of Jones family had mostly type 1 diabetes, while Bell family members had type 2 diabetes because they ate junk-food.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which family got diabetes 2 because of junk-food?  Hint: Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells no longer respond normally to insulin. The pancreas still makes insulin, but the cells of the body can’t use it. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes usually develops in adulthood. However, it is becoming more common in teens and children because more young people are overweight now than ever before.

The first quarter was all field goals, as Dallas scored first with a 41-yarder by Dan Bailey, followed by a 23-yarder for the Vikings by Blair Walsh. In the second quarter, Bailey made another field goal from 44 yards to put the Cowboys up by 3, but the Vikings took a 10-6 lead into halftime, capping the ensuing 79-yard drive with a 6-yard run by Ponder. After the half, Cowboy quarterback Tony Romo completed two consecutive 26-yard passes to tight end Jason Witten to give them an early touchdown and restore their three-point lead. On the very next play from scrimmage, Ponder fumbled the ball as he was sacked in the end zone, and the Cowboys' Nick Hayden recovered it for a touchdown, meaning the Vikings went from 10-6 up to 20-10 down in the space of two scrimmage plays. The Vikings responded immediately with a quick, six-play drive, culminating with a 31-yard pass from Ponder to Kyle Rudolph to cut the Cowboys' lead back to three points. After a series of punts going into the fourth quarter, Adrian Peterson scored for the Vikings with an 11-yard run with almost six minutes to go, but Walsh pushed the extra point kick wide right, giving the Vikings a three-point lead over the Cowboys. Vikings cornerback A. J. Jefferson intercepted Romo on the Cowboys' ensuing drive, putting the Vikings in a position to potentially take over the game, but the offense went three-and-out and was forced to punt.

We have this equation: -11 = -5*o + 9 Now, we want to find the number 'o'. To do this, follow these steps: 1. Move the 9 from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:    -11 - 9 = -5*o + 9 - 9 2. Now, our equation will look like this:    -20 = -5*o 3. To find 'o', we need to divide both sides of the equation by -5. This is because we want to get 'o' by itself:    (-20) / (-5) = (-5*o) / (-5) 4. After dividing, our equation will now look like this:    4 = o So, 'o' is equal to 4.

He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. After moving to Patras, Rouvas continued to look for performance opportunities until he met Dakis (a popular Greek artist who was the first person to help him professionally). Rouvas moved to Athens, and made his first professional appearance in 1991 at the Show Centre. His showmanship attracted the attention of music executives such as Nikos Mouratidis, who encouraged songwriter Giorgos Pavrianos to produce him. Rouvas, singing Michael Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\" was discovered by PolyGram executives who signed him to his first recording contract. After moving to Athens he lived with an older English woman named Sally, with whom he had begun a relationship on Corfu. Their relationship ended when Psinakis became Rouvas' manager, and the singer became more career-oriented. The media has speculated about Rouvas' personal life and relationships with model Zeta Logotheti, Sofi Kantarou (a Corfu bar manager) and singer Elli Kokkinou. Several months later he debuted at the Thessaloniki Song Festival, losing Best Vocal Performance to Giorgos Alkaios but singing the Best Composition (\\"Par'ta\\"; \\"Take Them\\", with music by Nikos Terzis and lyrics by Giorgos Pavrianos). There was a brief earthquake during the festival.  Rouvas released his eponymous debut album, which topped the Greek Albums Chart, the day after the festival. \\"Par'ta\\" became a radio hit, and other songs of the album such as \\"1992\\", \\"Ego S'agapo\\" (\\"I Love You\\") and \\"Gia Fantasou\\" (\\"Imagine\\") also became popular.  In September 1992 Rouvas released his second album, Min Andistekese (Don't Resist), also composed by Nikos Terzis.

At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.\\"?

Summarize this article: Peers amended the legislation paving the way for the in-out poll, due before 2018, to lower the voting age. But the move was overturned in a Commons vote, by 303 votes to 253 - a government majority of 50. The government said it would be wrong to alter the \\"tried and tested\\" general election franchise for a single poll. But Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems all favour allowing 16 and 17-year-olds - who were allowed to take part in last year's referendum on Scottish independence - to vote on whether to remain in the EU. Labour's shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, said the government's decision to block the move was \\"wrong-headed and unfair\\". Speaker John Bercow certified that the changes proposed by the House of Lords were covered by \\"financial privilege\\" rules, because the government had estimated that it would cost about Â£6m to implement. These rules can be used by the House of Commons \\"as grounds for overruling any House of Lords proposal that has cost implications\\". But BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Labour peers still hoped to force the government to lower the voting age, and would table a fresh motion that did not fall foul of the rules, on Monday. No date has been set for the referendum, but David Cameron has promised to hold it by the end of 2017. Summary:","output":"The UK government has blocked a move to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the upcoming EU referendum, overturning the legislation amendment made by peers. The Labour party, the SNP (Scottish National Party), and the Liberal Democrats are in favour of allowing this age group to vote, as they were allowed to participate in the Scottish independence referendum. The government argued that it would be wrong to change the general election franchise for a single poll.

What is the best way to: how do you turn off the alarm on a car with the remote.","output":"The best way to turn off the alarm on a car using the remote depends on the specific make and model of the vehicle, as well as the type of remote being used. However, here are some general guidelines to help you understand the process: 1. Identify the correct remote: Ensure that you have the correct remote for your vehicle, as many remotes are brand-specific and may not work with other vehicle models. In most cases, the remote that came with your car will be the appropriate one to use. 2. Locate the disarm or lock button: Look for a button on the remote with an icon of a locked padlock or one that says \\"disarm\\" or \\"unlock.\\" This button is typically used for disarming the vehicle's security system and unlocking the doors. 3. Stand within range of the vehicle: Make sure you are within the specified range specified by the manufacturer for the remote to effectively communicate with the vehicle. This is typically around 30 to 100 feet. 4. Point the remote towards the vehicle: Direct the remote towards the vehicle, ensuring that there are no obstructions between the remote and the car. 5. Press the disarm/lock button: Press the disarm or lock button once, and hold it for one to three seconds. Most car alarms will turn off and the vehicle's lights will flash, indicating that the alarm has been disarmed. 6. Check for confirmation: After pressing the disarm/lock button, wait for a confirmation signal, such as a flashing of the vehicle's lights or an audible chirp. This indicates that the alarm has been successfully turned off. 7. Unlock the doors: If your remote has a separate button for unlocking the doors, press this button once the alarm has been disarmed to unlock the doors and gain access to the vehicle. 8. Manual override (if necessary): If the remote does not successfully disarm the alarm, you may need to use a key to manually unlock the door and start the vehicle. Inserting the key in the ignition and turning it to the \\"on\\" position may reset the alarm system, allowing you to turn off the alarm. 9. If problems persist, consult the vehicle's owner manual: If the above steps do not work, refer to the owner's manual for your specific vehicle make and model to find the recommended procedure for disarming the alarm system. 10. Seek professional help, if needed: If the alarm cannot be disarmed following these steps and the suggestions in the owner's manual, consider contacting an automotive locksmith or the dealership for assistance. They can help diagnose and fix any issues that may be preventing you from disarming the car alarm. Remember that the exact procedure may vary depending on your specific vehicle and remote, so always consult your vehicle's owner manual or contact the manufacturer for the most accurate information on disarming your car's alarm system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A man went to a place called a nightclub with his friends to have some fun. A nightclub is a big room where people go to dance, listen to music, and enjoy time together.  While the man was there, something not nice happened. Another person at the nightclub got very angry and did a mean thing. That person punched the man, just one time, but it was very hard. This punch, like when you hit something with your fist, hurt the man very much.  He got very, very sick, and his body didn't work the way it was supposed to anymore. His family and friends were very worried, and they took him to a place called a hospital. A hospital is a special place where doctors and nurses help people get better when they're sick. The man's daddy wanted to let other daddies and mommies know how bad it is to hit someone, even if you're angry or upset. So, he decided to show other people a picture, called a photograph, of his son in the hospital. The photograph showed his son in a bed, full of machines that were helping him feel better.  The dad hoped that by sharing this photograph, other people would look at it and remember to be nice and kind to each other, even when they get angry.

Does word \\"pain\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? Your mother is a right pain. That kid is a terrible pain.","output":"Yes, the word \\"pain\\" essentially carries the same connotation in both sentences but it's being used in an idiomatic context, more specifically a colloquial expression rather than its literal meaning. This idiomatic usage is indicating that someone is annoying or a source of bother rather than inferring physical discomfort or distress. In the sentence \\"Your mother is a right pain,\\" it suggests that the person's mother is perceived as annoying, bothersome, or is causing some sort of mental stress, irritation or inconvenience to the speaker. For instance, the person may feel like the mother is somewhat intrusive, controlling, excessively worrying, or perhaps failing to respect their boundaries, rendering the individual to find her presence or behavioral traits burdensome. The second sentence \\"That kid is a terrible pain\\" employs the word \\"pain\\" in a similar sense. Here, it is suggesting that the mentioned kid is found to be highly bothersome or annoying by the speaker. This could be because the kid is acting naughtily, is excessively noisy, is disobedient, or is engaging in some sort of behavior that the speaker finds disruptive or distressing. The use of the word \\"terrible\\" enhances the degree of annoyance or inconvenience, indicating that the kid is not just a mild irritation, but a significant nuisance. So, while the specific source and nature of annoyance may vary from situation to situation, the core connotation of the word \\"pain\\" as an expression of strong inconvenience, bother, or annoyance remains consistent in both sentences. It's worth noting that this usage is quite informal and metaphorical, and typically seen in casual conversation. It's important to note that language is complex, nuanced and context-dependent. The personal relationship with the person referred to as a \\"pain\\", the situation, the tone and other contextual factors can add layers of emotion and connotation to the meaning of these sentences beyond the basic definition of the word \\"pain\\"."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, a more detailed and long answer would be as follows: The Watergate scandal started with the break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington on June 17, 1972. A group of burglars, who were later discovered to be connected with President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign, were arrested for breaking into the DNC offices and attempting to wiretap the phones. The burglars were later identified as former CIA operatives and former FBI agents. This break-in was only the tip of the iceberg, as it soon became clear that it was connected to a much larger web of illegal actions and abuses of power by the Nixon administration. The scandal was further fueled by the revelation that there was a secret White House taping system that had recorded conversations and discussions related to the break-in and its cover-up. Nixon was accused of several wrongdoings, which can be summed up in the following points: 1. Obstruction of Justice: President Nixon and his administration attempted to cover up their involvement in the break-in and other illegal activities throughout the investigation. This included the payment of hush money to the burglars, destruction of evidence, and interference with the FBI's investigation. 2. Abuse of Power: Nixon was accused of using his presidential powers for personal and political gain by ordering the break-in to collect information on the DNC and their election strategies. Additionally, Nixon had misused government agencies, such as the FBI, CIA, and IRS, to harass political opponents and gain control over them. 3. Contempt of Congress: Nixon refused to comply with subpoenas issued by the congressional committee investigating the scandal, leading to his being charged with contempt of Congress. As the investigation progressed, and as more evidence of Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up was revealed, his support in Congress diminished. Facing an almost certain impeachment and removal from office, on August 8, 1974, President Nixon announced his resignation, becoming the first U.S. president to resign from office. The Watergate scandal had significant implications on American politics and public trust in the government, leading to various reforms aimed at increasing government transparency and accountability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Q: What type of minerals form when salt water evaporates?   A: OPT: (1). sulfide; (2). carbonate; (3). fermite; (4). halide; A:","output":"When salt water evaporates, it leads to the formation of a specific group of minerals known as evaporite minerals. These minerals are formed due to the precipitation of dissolved ions in the saltwater as it loses water content. The process of evaporation concentrates the minerals in the remaining water, resulting in the crystallization of these minerals. The most common evaporite minerals formed by this process can be categorized into the following groups: 1. Halide minerals: Halides are compounds in which one or more halogen elements, such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I), combine with a metal ion. In the context of salt water evaporation, the most common halide mineral that forms is halite (NaCl), commonly known as rock salt. Halite is a natural source of sodium chloride and is widely used in various industries, including food processing, agriculture, and chemical production. Other halide minerals include sylvite (KCl), which is an important source of potassium, and carnallite (KMgCl3·6H2O), which is a hydrated magnesium-potassium chloride. 2. Sulfate minerals: Sulfate minerals are characterized by the presence of an anion group (SO4)2-. After halides, sulfates are the second most common group of evaporite minerals. Gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O), anhydrite (CaSO4), and epsomite (MgSO4·7H2O) are some of the common evaporite sulfate minerals. Gypsum has various commercial applications, such as in the production of plaster and cement, while anhydrite is used as a soil amendment and in the production of sulfuric acid. Epsomite, also known as Epsom salt, is used in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and as a bath salt. 3. Carbonate minerals: While carbonate minerals are not as commonly formed by saltwater evaporation as halides and sulfates, they may still occur in certain conditions. Carbonates contain a carbonate ion (CO3)2- that combines with a metal ion. Some of the common carbonate evaporite minerals include calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2]. These minerals can play a significant role in the formation of sedimentary rocks like limestone and dolostone. 4. Borate minerals: Borate evaporite minerals, which contain the borate anion (BO3)3-, occur less frequently in comparison to the other evaporite minerals. However, they are still an important group of minerals due to their industrial applications. Borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O) and kernite (Na2B4O7·4H2O) are two common borate minerals that can be found in evaporite deposits. Borate minerals are used in various applications, such as detergents, glass manufacturing, and as a flame retardant. The formation of these evaporite minerals through the evaporation of saltwater is a natural process, and these minerals can be extracted from vast deposits called salt pans, salt flats, or salt beds. The concentration of minerals in saltwater, along with various environmental factors, can influence the types and quantities of evaporite minerals formed during the evaporation process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
