The speaker is expressing a deep sense of dissatisfaction and regret about having watched the movie, and as a result, they wish they could go back in time and undo the experience altogether. The statement refers to Celebi, a mythical Pokémon with the ability to travel through time.

Article:State television declared on Thursday that the Old City was \\"totally clean of armed terrorist groups\\" but officials later confirmed that the evacuation was not fully over. Earlier, Homs Governor Talal al-Barazi said more than 1,500 fighters and their relatives had left since Wednesday. The evacuation marks the end of three years of resistance in Homs. Syria's third city was once dubbed the \\"capital of the revolution\\". Much of Homs fell to the opposition in 2011, but over the past two years government forces have gradually regained control by subjecting areas once home to tens of thousands to continuous siege and bombardment. By Paul WoodBBC News, Beirut War-weariness key to ending fight over Homs In pictures: Homs evacuated in ruins Government forces took full control of the heart of Homs on Thursday, state media said, after rebels in the Old City boarded buses and were transported to rebel-held territory to the north. \\"Old Homs is totally clean of armed terrorist groups,\\" state television said, using the government's term for those seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad. However, Syrian officials have since told the BBC that 280 fighters are still to be evacuated from the city, and the process will resume on Friday. Earlier Mr Barazi and UN officials were also quoted as saying the evacuation was not fully over. Mr Barazi said Homs would be declared a \\"secure city\\" once the UN-supervised evacuation was complete, and that reconstruction would begin immediately. The army is expected to move in fully on Friday, when the Old City will be swept for explosives. Earlier, Hezbollah's al-Manar television broadcast footage of a group of rebel fighters walking past security forces personnel and boarding several green buses. There were similar scenes on Wednesday, when 980 people were evacuated. The fighters, who were each allowed to leave with a rifle and a bag of belongings, pledged to continue the armed struggle and one day return. Speaking to the BBC at the end of the first day of the operation, the UN's resident co-ordinator in Syria, Yacoub El Hillo, said he hoped Homs would now be free from violence. Homs: Syrian revolution's 'capital' He expressed hope that people would be able to return to their homes, but he cautioned against rushing back because the area was \\"inundated with unexploded ordnance, including landmines and booby traps\\". The Old City was \\"incredibly and comprehensively destroyed\\" and was currently \\"uninhabitable\\", Mr Hillo said, adding that it would be a \\"huge task\\" to rebuild and restore homes and infrastructure. The withdrawal is part of a deal that will also see rebels release 70 captives in Aleppo and Latakia provinces, and ease sieges of two predominantly Shia towns in the north - Nubul and Zahraa - that are loyal to President Assad. Mr Barazi told the BBC that those released by the rebels were all Syrians, with the exception of an Iranian woman married to a Syrian man. Efforts to ensure the release of other captives were continuing, he added. The agreement followed months of negotiations between security officials and rebel representatives, reportedly mediated by the Iranian ambassador to Syria. There is now only one district in Homs - al-Wair in the north-western outskirts - that is still controlled by the opposition. However, Mr Barazi said he expected a similar evacuation deal to be reached in the coming weeks. More than 150,000 people are believed to have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began in March 2011. Another nine million have fled their homes. Despite the conflict, the Syrian government is planning to hold a presidential election on 3 June. The opposition have dismissed the poll, which Mr Assad is widely expected to win, as a farce. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Syrian government forces have taken full control of the heart of Homs after rebels in the Old City were transported to rebel-held territory to the north.

Answer the following question: TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers. I get a lecture and a warning, the end. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How old was the customer?

Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did.  and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Please answer this question : Which town caused more fertilizer runoff? Answer:","output":"Gold town caused more fertilizer runoff since it used fertilizers and pesticides, while Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any.

Answer:","output":"Among the given answer choices, the best answer is \\"cloudy and rainy weather.\\"  When warm air advances on cold air, it forms a warm front. A warm front is the transition zone between a mass of warm air and the colder air it is replacing. In meteorology, we recognize that different air masses have distinct characteristics, such as temperature and humidity. The interaction between these air masses at their boundaries, known as weather fronts, often leads to distinct weather phenomena. In the case of a warm front, the warm air is less dense and tends to rise over the colder, denser air. As the warm air lifts and cools, the amount of moisture it can hold decreases, leading to the condensation of water vapor into clouds. These clouds can cover a wide area, sometimes extending hundreds of miles ahead of the warm front. As the warm front advances on cold air, it results in areas of prolonged and widespread cloud coverage and steady precipitation, which is why we associate warm fronts with cloudy and rainy weather. The other answer choices provided are not directly related to the question or are otherwise incorrect. White outs are caused by blowing snow and are more related to strong winds than air masses. Heat production, energy of moving objects, freezing nitrogen, and kinetic energy are not specifically related to the interaction of warm air advancing on cold air. A tree falling is an unrelated event, and tsunamis are triggered by underwater earthquakes or other geological events and are not directly associated with atmospheric conditions.  In conclusion, when warm air advances on cold air, forming a warm front, the most likely result is cloudy and rainy weather, as this best represents the meteorological phenomenon associated with the interaction of these air masses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Fossella, a Staten Island native, was born to a family that included several politicians. Fossella initially took office in 1997, after winning a special election held to replace the resigning Susan Molinari. As a result of a DUI arrest in Alexandria, Virginia on May 1, 2008, followed by the public disclosure a week later that he had had an affair with Laura Fay, a retired US Air Force lieutenant colonel, that had resulted in a three-year-old child while Fossella was married, he announced on his official website on May 20 that he had chosen to serve out the remainder of his term, which ended on January 3, 2009, but decided not to run for re-election. Before Fossella announced that he would not run in 2008, he was included in the National Republican Congressional Committee's list of Republican candidates who qualified for fundraising help because they were thought to be particularly vulnerable.  Steve Harrison hoped to run against Fossella again in the 2008 election, but New York City Council member Domenic Recchia also began seeking the Democratic nomination.  For several days after his DWI arrest and his admission of an adulterous affair and fathering an out-of-wedlock child, Fossella gave indications that he might run for re-election despite these problems. On May 20, however, he dropped out of the race.  On May 28, the Staten Island Democratic Party endorsed City Councilman Michael E. McMahon for the Democratic nomination, although Harrison said he would remain a candidate in the Democratic primary. On the Republican side, several prominent elected officials considered running but decided against it. On May 29, the Staten Island Republican Party endorsed Frank Powers, a member of the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority who had never held elective office but who promised to spend 500,000 of his own money on the race. However, Powers died on June 22. Powers's son (Frank M. Powers) was also in the race, running as a Libertarian; however, the Libertarian Party did not endorse him. Robert Straniere was on the ballot for the Republican Party, and Susan Overeem was the Libertarian Party candidate.  McMahon won the election on November 4, 2008, and replaced Fossella in Congress on January 3, 2009. Did he win?","output":"No, Vito Fossella did not win the 2008 election.

If you want the duvet to hang over the sides a little more, or you’re really tall, you might consider getting the next size up. The ticking, or the outer part of the duvet, is what holds the filling and is usually made of 100% cotton. It’s important to look at the thread count of the ticking, especially if buying a down or feather duvet. The higher the thread count, the tighter the fabric is woven, meaning it will be much harder for feathers to escape.  Buying a duvet made of cotton ticking, or cotton-polyester, ensures your duvet is super breathable. Aim for a thread count of 200 or more. To keep the filling spread out, sewn through box construction has both sides of the duvet sewn together to create boxes. While this keeps the filling in place, it also doesn't allow filling to reach the edges of each box, making it less warm. In a baffle box structure, small walls are built between each square so that the filling remains spread out while still retaining its warmth. In this construction, there aren't any cold spots. Baffle box construction is more expensive than sewn through box construction due to its more intricate structure. Since duvets aren't easily cleaned, choosing a cover for your duvet will help protect it and make the cleaning process much easier. Duvet covers come in many different materials and styles, allowing you to choose one that matches your bedroom or personal preferences.  Duvet covers are less expensive than regular duvets, making them an affordable option. The covers attach to the duvet with zippers, buttons, or ties. Summary:","output":"Duvets are available in various sizes, including twin, full, queen, and king, corresponding to mattress sizes. For extra coverage or taller individuals, consider choosing a size larger. The outer part (ticking) is usually made of 100% cotton, and its thread count should be considered, particularly for down or feather duvets. A higher thread count indicates a tighter fabric weave, preventing feather escape. Cotton ticking or cotton-polyester duvets are breathable, with a recommended thread count of 200 or more. There are two types of construction for duvets: sewn-through box and baffle box. Sewn-through box construction involves sewing both sides of the duvet together, creating boxes that evenly distribute filling; however, this design can lead to less warmth. Baffle box construction uses small walls between squares to maintain filling distribution and warmth, without cold spots. This construction is more expensive due to its complex structure. Duvet covers are essential as they protect the duvet and simplify the cleaning process. They come in various materials and styles to match personal preferences and bedroom aesthetics.

But considering the scale of the abuses that the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee revealed on Tuesday in its report on CIA torture, one might have expected a bit more outrage from the leaders of the Old World. Instead, the most common reaction was to praise the report as a sign of American transparency and accountability—two of the values meant to bind the West together—while many European statesmen have so far avoided saying anything at all. That includes the leaders of France and Germany, who made no public reaction in the 24 hours that followed the report’s release. British Prime Minister David Cameron only mentioned it while on a visit to Turkey on Wednesday when a reporter asked him for a response. “I’m satisfied that our system is dealing with all of these issues,” Cameron said. The practice of torture, he confidently added, is “wrong.” The most prominent sign of European contrition came from Poland, whose former President finally admitted during a press conference on Wednesday that his country hosted one of the CIA’s “black sites,” or secret prisons, where the abuse of detainees occurred. The U.S. had asked Poland “to find a quiet place, where effective measures could be taken to obtain information,” said Alexander Kwasniewski, who served as President from 1995 to 2005. Poland had consented to the request, he added, without knowing that the “quiet place” could be used for torture. He did not clarify the year when the facility was shut down. But the prevailing sentiment among Europe-watchers was that these revelations were considered old news. “All of this was ten years ago,” explains Constanze Stelzenmueller, an expert on European politics at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. “What’s striking is that the Americans are now really trying to do a reasonably honest and non-partisan accounting of what happened.” That American admission of guilt, and the integrity it required, did not go unnoticed even in some of the most damning editorials published in the mainstream European press. “The United States makes mistakes, sometimes terrible ones,” read an editorial in Der Spiegel, Germany’s leading newsmagazine. “But it has the strength to acknowledge it and learn from it.” The muted reaction from European leaders, says Stelzenmueller, is perhaps best explained by the dilemma this issue presents. If one of them praises the report’s transparency, they could be perceived as downplaying the gravity of the crimes committed in the execution of the war on terror. If one of them condemns those crimes, they will almost certainly face questions about their own country’s complicity, if not also its direct involvement, in torture and illegal detention. “The risk of the follow-up question is in any case greater than the political gains,” Stelzenmueller says. But that did not stop some European politicians from using the report as political ammunition. In Germany, the co-chairman of the opposition Left Party, Bernd Riexinger, called for Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to resign over the revelations. He also demanded Berlin rethink its cooperation with the U.S. on matters of intelligence. “I see no basis for cooperation with torturers,” Riexinger, whose party controls about 10% of the seats in the German parliament, told the Handelsblatt newspaper. The Foreign Minister, who also held the position from 2005 to 2009, did not deign to respond to the remarks, though he did issue one of the harsher condemnations against the CIA’s torture practices to issue from the European leadership. “What was then considered right and done in the fight against Islamic terrorism was unacceptable and a serious mistake,” Steinmeier told the German daily Bild, adding that the CIA’s activities amounted to a “gross violation of our liberal, democratic values.” But experts still saw no real chance of the report forcing Berlin or any other major European power to question their transatlantic ties. The reason, says Joerg Forbrig, an expert on Central and Eastern Europe at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, has to do with the ongoing standoff with Russia over Ukraine, which has urged the West to band together against what they perceive as a common threat to their security. “The key ingredient to any successful Russia policy is Western unity,” he says. And as German Chancellor Angela Merkel pursues an ever tougher line against Moscow, “She needs to rally the Europeans, and she needs to make sure the coordination with the Americans remains intact.” So if the White House was expecting the Senate report to freeze relations across the Atlantic, it can probably breathe a sigh of relief. Read next: Here’s What the CIA Actually Did in Interrogations","output":"Recently, the US Senate Intelligence Committee released a report about the CIA using harsh treatments, like torture, on people they thought were bad. Many people thought that European leaders would be upset about this news. However, most of the leaders either praised the report for being honest or didn't say anything about it at all. The president of Poland admitted that his country helped the CIA by providing a secret place for them to work, but he didn't know they would use it for torture. Some politicians in Europe used the report to criticize others, but there isn't expected to be any big changes in the relationships between Europe and the United States because of the report."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A card with a large black ace (of spades) is put on his chest. Another \\"Black Ace\\" victim. The killer sends his victims a Black Ace card, warning them they are to die and then kills them, his way of taunting the police. Neil Broderick, an author, intends writing a book about him and is on his way to see Thornton Drake to get more information about him. Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago. Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: \\"At seven tomorrow night\\", the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go. On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him. At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction. Neil goes to another room and makes a phone call, then signals to someone outside. After he finishes his call, the line is cut. Meanwhile one of the pilots has taken off in the plane, leaving the other pilot, Henderson, behind who claims he does not know anything though he was out of the cockpit when Winters was killed. The coroner finds a letter on the dead man which is to be read if Winters dies. It will reveal the identity of the Black Ace.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The general rule for lure color is \\"bright day, light colors; dark day, dark colors.\\" On bright, sunny days and in clear water conditions, choose lures that are light in color and mimic natural patterns. On cloudy days and in dirty water conditions, choose darker lures and those with a non-natural coloration, preferably types that make noise or vibrate as they move through the water. A notable exception to this rule is the use of 2-toned plastic worms that feature a darker head color and a fluorescent pink or yellow tail color. Many anglers use plastic worms colored like this when fishing in cloudy water conditions. In general, choose smaller jigs and grubs when fishing for panfish (bluegill, sunfish, crappie, perch) and larger lures such as spinnerbaits and crankbaits when fishing for bigger fish (bass, walleye, and pike). Smaller lures are best suited for light and ultralight spinning and spincasting tackle (or fly rods in the case of dry and wet flies) with lines of 4 to 10-pound test (2 to 5 kg class), while larger lures are meant to be fished with medium to heavy action rods, spinning or baitcasting reels, and lines of 12 to 20-pound test (6 to 10 kg class) or better. (Lures used to fish for muskellunge, the largest member of the pike family, are decidedly larger than those used for bass, walleye, and northern pike, and often require the use of a wire leader because of the muskie's sharp teeth.) Lure size can also be dictated by weather conditions and how fish react to them. In early spring, or when cold front conditions clear the skies and cool the water to make fish lethargic, smaller lures are usually better choices than larger lures. (Lures used for ice fishing are exceptionally tiny, usually grub jigs or small spoons.) In high-wind conditions, you may need to use a larger lure simply to have enough resistance on the end of the line to keep the wind from bowing it so that you can't detect if fish are hitting the lure. Also try casting out a spinner and just keep casting and retrieving the lure.","output":"Choose light-colored lures on bright days and in clear water, and darker, noisier ones in murky conditions or on cloudy days, adjusting size based on target fish and weather conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do another round of smoothing with your hands to get the material as flat and even as possible. Try to match the overlapping of the original headliner fabric, if possible. Spray the adhesive onto the edge of the panel and the 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric that’s left after you trimmed the material. Fold the fabric so it wraps over the side of the panel. Use your hands to smooth it out.  Don’t pull or stretch the fabric or it can form air pockets between the fabric and the board. The folded bit of fabric will allow the material to stay better attached to the board. Use a utility knife or razor blade to trim the fabric covering the holes where the accessories, such as a light or a mirror, were inserted. Cut the fabric so it’s flush against the edge and there isn’t any excess material hanging over the side. Trim any of the holes in the headliner board that are used to insert accessories so you can install it properly. Turn the panel and rotate it so you can fit it back inside the vehicle with the fabric side facing out.

Emerging from a closed meeting with the heads of foreign militaries, President Obama told reporters the effort to dismantle the terror group ISIS \\"is going to be a long-term campaign. \\" \\"There will be days of progress and there are going to be periods of setback,\\" he said, adding that an influx of fighters from outside the region joining ISIS makes it a threat beyond the Middle East and into the U.S. Defense chiefs from 22 nations fighting ISIS met all day at a secure facility to discuss the current military operations and \\"the way ahead' according to a senior U.S. military official. The full coalition will be needed, according to Obama. \\"We are going to have to pay attention to how all the countries in the region begin to cooperate in rooting out this cancer and we are going to have to continue on delivering the humanitarian assistance of all the populations that have been affected.\\" The meeting Tuesday was chaired by General Martin Dempsey, U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with General Lloyd Austin, commanding general of the U.S. Central Command which is largely running the operations in both Iraq and Syria. President Obama attended for a portion near the end of the day at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington, DC. Iraqi military officials were expected to attend. Syrian opposition members were not invited because the meeting is for \\"sovereign nations\\" only, the official said. Classified discussions are expected to take place on the current operations. There was expected, however, to be some discussion of arming and training moderate Syrian opposition forces. ISIS militants march on despite airstrikes, international outrage. It was not expected that the coalition defense chiefs would discuss some significant change in strategy, the official said before the meetings got underway. \\"This meeting is to share our vision, discuss coordination and our common understanding of the way ahead.\\" The defense chiefs are not policymakers, so any significant changes in the mission would require a decision by governments on a political level. This is the fourth such meeting of coalition partners, but the largest gathering to date. Similar meetings have been held in recent months in Jordan, Paris and Bonn. The military operation against ISIS now does have a name but the Pentagon is not expected to reveal it until later this week, a U.S. military official confirms to CNN. The name will not be made public until a formal 'execution order' covering the entire mission against ISIS is published by the Defense Department's Joint Staff perhaps as soon as Wednesday. Naming the operation is a fairly bureaucratic matter, but it is typically done in large scale or significant military operations as a means of providing a mechanism for everything from budgeting of funds to awarding of medals. The execution order will spell out these details, as well as potential command arrangements, and a formal military definition of the mission. Related: Pentagon to release ISIS codename.

Scientists are finding evidence that gum chewing may be good for your health. It may even help improve your test scores. This exciting research is just beginning. And in the meantime, companies are also experimenting with adding vitamins, minerals, medicines, and other substances that could give gum the power to cure headaches and fight everything from serious diseases to bad breath. Other researchers are finding that gum might work better than a pill to deliver medicines and other substances into the bloodstream. That's because the lining   of our cheeks can absorb certain substances more quickly than our stomachs and intestines   can. That discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial   gums that cure bad breath. Those projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake. Researchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert. Each stick has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. It can take an hour for the caffeine in coffee to have its full effect, but the caffeine in Stay Alert _ in just a few minutes. The gum is easy to transport and it's stable in cold and hot climates. Unlike a pill, it doesn't require water to swallow. Those qualities make it easy for soldiers to use.

Without giving any damm to my privacy she opened the phone and it was my bad luck that there was no screen lock. The movie automatically started and after 5 seconds she took the phone to my dad she said “This is what he is doing when he's alone” My parents called me what is this ?? I said it's a video message from the company and it starts automatically. I have nothing to do with that stuff and suddenly my dad said yes he is right, it's a video from the company and asked me to delete the video.

California authorities have surrounded a wanted parolee accused of shooting federal and local officers, hitting three and wounding one more with shrapnel fragments, police said. After that initial shooting, Samuel Duran ran and hopped fences in a Roseville neighborhood as members of various law enforcement agencies converged on the scene, police said. Authorities located him at an otherwise unoccupied house in Roseville, which is 20 miles northeast of Sacramento. \\"I know he's pinned down,\\" Roseville police Lt. Cal Walstad said. Duran has been sought by authorities \\"for the last couple of weeks,\\" according to Walstad, who did not detail what crimes the suspect had been tied to. After determining where he was in Roseville, local police and a special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit went there Friday afternoon. According to Walstad, \\"once they made contact with him, shots were exchanged.\\" The ICE special agent was shot in the leg and transported to a local hospital, the police spokesman said. He was reported to be stable and alert a few hours later, said ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice. The suspect ran, firing at times and jumping fences. Three Roseville police officers ended up wounded at a third shooting site . One was struck in the jaw, one was hit in the shoulder, and the third wounded by bullet fragments, according to Walstad. One of the Roseville officers was in serious condition, while the other two were stable, he said. Chief Daniel Hahn added later Friday that none of the injuries to the officers, all of them men and veterans of the department, are considered life-threatening. Authorities from multiple agencies quickly converged on the scene looking for Duran, who Walstad said had an \\"assault-type weapon.\\" Neighbors were asked not to leave their houses, but they were never evacuated. The scene was later considered \\"contained\\" -- even though police hadn't said they knew exactly where the suspect was. Now that they do, he's being surrounded by law enforcement. Hostage negotiations are on site as well, though it's not believed that the suspect has taken any hostages. Authorities are talking to the suspect by telephone, Walstad said. Brenda Bell told CNN affiliate KCRA that the suspect is in her house; she went outside after her \\"dogs went crazy,\\" then she ran into a neighbor's house after seeing him run through her back gate. \\"(Police) keep repeating, 'We have the house surrounded. Come out with your hands up,'\\" Jim Stewart, the neighbor who invited Bell in, said Friday night. \\"They've been doing this for hours now.\\" Placer County Sheriff Edward Bonner described the situation as \\"incredibly dangerous,\\" while expressing confidence it'll be resolved as well as possible. \\"This is a very tough day,\\" Bonner said. \\"It's unsettling for all us; no one is immune to this sort of tragedy and criminality.

Hint: Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, it does not give a direct answer to the question on who needs less vitamin C in their diet. However, we can reason that since girls between the ages of 14 and 18 need more iron (15 mg) daily compared to boys between the ages of 14 and 18 (11 mg), Jessica might have a higher requirement for vitamin C in her diet. This is because vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron in the body.

So sad  What is the sentiment of this tweet?","output":"The sentiment expressed in this tweet can be considered a mix of surprise and sadness. The use of the word \\"Wow\\" indicates an element of shock or surprise at the legal proceedings that happened, giving the impression that the news about Jon and Kate's marriage dissolution was unexpected or caught the person off guard. On the other hand, the phrase \\"So sad\\" reveals a sense of empathy, sadness, and disappointment towards the end of Jon and Kate's marriage. Beyond the primary emotions of surprise and sadness, the tweet may imply further levels of concern or disapproval. For instance, the description of the legal proceedings that \\"happened TODAY\\" creates a sense of urgency and suddenness, possibly suggesting that the person who tweeted this may think that the event was rushed or untimely. Additionally, the exclamation \\"So sad\\" could highlight that the dissolution is being seen as a tragic event, maybe reflecting the belief that Jon and Kate should have sought other means for resolving their issues rather than seeking a legal dissolution of their marriage. In summary, the sentiment expressed in this tweet is a mixture of surprise (through \\"Wow\\") and sadness (indicated by \\"So sad\\"), while potentially hinting at additional feelings of concern and disapproval about the abruptness and overall implications of Jon and Kate's marriage dissolution that occurred on that day."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To solve this equation, 15*x - 20*x = 49*x - 810, you combine like terms, which means you gather the \\"x\\" on one side, and regular numbers on the other side. On the left side, 15*x - 20*x gives you -5*x. Do you remember your subtraction? If you have 15 apples, and I take 20 away from you, you will owe me 5 apples! Now, let's rearrange the equation to make it easier to solve. If you look at it now, it is -5*x = 49*x - 810. But, let's move the x-values to one side by adding 5*x to both sides so we have 0 on one side. This will give us 0 = 54*x - 810. Next, we want to isolate x (or, in simpler terms, find out what magic number x is!). To do this, let's move the 810 to the other side of the equation by adding 810 to both sides giving us, 810 = 54*x. Finally, let's find x by dividing 810 by 54 (because division is the opposite of multiplication!). So 810 divided by 54 (810/54) gives an exact answer of 15 as the value for x.  Isn't it fun?

To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly.

Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

Sensor size Along with the megapixel count,the size of the sensor dictates the general image quality as well as the camera's performance in low light. It also determines whether the camera can electronically put the details it captures bigger enough to see--which is what makes the pictures not clear enough to see when you view the photos on a bigger screen.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rajinikanth was born on 12 December 1950, in a Maratha family in Bangalore, Mysore State (present day Karnataka). His mother was a housewife, and his father Ramoji Rao Gaekwad, a police constable, He was named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad after Chhatrapati Shivaji, a Maratha warrior King, and was brought up speaking Marathi at home and Kannada outside. Rajinikanth's ancestors hailed from Mavadi Kadepathar, Maharashtra and Nachikuppam, Tamil Nadu. He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers (Satyanarayana Rao and Nageshwara Rao) and a sister (Aswath Balubhai). Rajinikanth has often been referred to as the most popular film actor in South India by the media and audiences. In 2015, a film about his fandom, For the Love of a Man, premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival.  His popularity has been attributed to \\"his uniquely styled dialogues and idiosyncrasies in films, as well as his political statements and philanthropy\\". Many also cite reasons for Rajinikanth's popularity as coming from his larger-than-life super-hero appearance in many films, supported by gravity-defying stunts and charismatic expressions, all while attempting to maintain modesty in real-life. Almost every film of Rajinikanth has punchlines delivered by him in an inimitable style, and these punchlines often have a message or even warn the film's antagonists. These dialogues are usually fabricated to create new ones or even be taken in a comical way, but do not fail to create a sense of entertainment among viewers. It is suggested by the media that actresses such as Gouthami and Nayanthara got their initial breakthrough after co-starring with Rajinikanth very early in their careers, giving other aspiring actors the urge to work with him.  Rajinikanth is also the only Indian actor to be featured in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus, in a lesson titled From Bus Conductor to Superstar. After opening his first official Twitter account in 2014, Rajinikanth received over 210,000 followers within 24 hours, which according to The Economic Times was deemed by social media research firms as the fastest rate of followers for any Indian celebrity, as well as among the top-10 in the world.  Much like Chuck Norris facts, \\"Rajinikanth facts\\" or \\"Rajinikanth jokes\\" are widely circulated in text messages and memes over the Internet.

The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in... contains an answer for the question: What were the two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow were the number of clerics required to staff the cathedral and the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The growth in these positions was due to the cathedral's various periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390, which led to an increasing need for personnel to both manage the religious aspects of the cathedral and maintain its structural integrity and aesthetics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - John Wesley (or ; 2 March 1791) was an Anglican cleric and theologian who, with his brother Charles and fellow cleric George Whitefield, founded Methodism.  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.  - Martin Luther (10 November 1483  18 February 1546), O.S.A., was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.  - Charles Wesley (or ; 18 December 1707  29 March 1788) was an English leader of the Methodist movement, most widely known for writing more than 6,000 hymns.  - Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestant Christianity which identifies with the theology of Martin Luther (1483-1546), a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer and theologian.  - George Whitefield (30 September 1770), also spelled George Whitfield, was an English Anglican cleric who was one of the founders of Methodism and the evangelical movement.  - Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary work, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Generically, a Galilean is an inhabitant of Galilee. Historically, a Galilean dialect of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic was spoken there. Later, the term was used to refer to the early Christians, among others by the Roman emperors Julian and Marcus Aurelius.  - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or   , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.  - Joseph ( Hebrew  , Yosef ; Greek :  , Ioseph ) is a figure in the Gospels , the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the mother of Jesus , and is venerated as Saint Joseph in the Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodox Church , Anglican Communion , Lutheranism and Methodism . Christian tradition places Joseph as Jesus ' foster father . Some historians state that Joseph was Jesus 's father . Some differing views are due to theological interpretations versus historical views . The Pauline epistles make no reference to Jesus 's father ; nor does the Gospel of Mark . The first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of Matthew and Luke . Each contains a genealogy of Jesus showing ancestry from king David , but through different sons ; Matthew follows the major royal line from Solomon , while Luke traces another line back to Nathan , another son of David and Bathsheba . Consequently , all the names between David and Joseph are different . According to Matthew 1:16 \`\` Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary '' , while according to Luke 3:23 , Joseph is said to be \`\` ( the son ) of Heli '' . Some scholars reconcile the genealogies by viewing the Solomonic lineage in Matthew as Joseph 's major royal line , and the Nathanic lineage in Luke to be Mary 's minor line . In Catholic and other traditions , Joseph is the patron saint of workers and has several feast days . He was also declared to be the patron saint and protector of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius IX in 1870 , and is the patron of several countries and regions . With the growth of Mariology , the theological field of Josephology has also grown and since the 1950s centers for studying it have been formed .  - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.

What is the best way to: To make sure that a bolt stays securely inserted in a piece of wood, you can","output":"use several techniques which can significantly improve the stability and strength of the connection between the bolt and the piece of wood. Some of these methods are mentioned below: 1. Choose the appropriate bolt: Select the correct bolt type, size, and length that is suitable for your project. Factors affecting the bolt choice include the type of wood, the thickness of the wood pieces, and the design of the connection. 2. Pre-drilling: Drill a pilot hole, slightly smaller than the bolt diameter, in the wood where you want to insert the bolt. This will help to prevent the wood from splitting or cracking due to the pressure exerted by the bolt. Make sure to use the appropriate drill bit size for the bolt being used. 3. Use washers: Adding a washer between the bolt head and the wood surface distributes the clamping force evenly, minimizing the risk of the wood cracking under pressure. Additionally, incorporating a washer on the nut side of the connection, helps to prevent the nut from digging into the wood when tightened. 4. Apply a thread locking compound: Using a thread locking compound, such as Loctite, on the bolt's threads can help prevent it from loosening due to vibrations or other external forces. Apply the compound to the bolt's threads before inserting it into the wood and tightening the nut. 5. Tightening torque: To make sure the bolt stays securely inserted, tighten the nut to the appropriate torque based on the bolt size and specifications. Over-tightening can lead to wood damage and compromise the strength of the connection, while under-tightening may result in a loose bolt. 6. Use of locknuts: A locknut is specifically designed to resist loosening when properly tightened on a bolt. They can be used instead of standard nuts to ensure a secure connection that is less likely to loosen over time. Some popular types of locknuts include nylon-insert locknuts and distorted-thread locknuts. 7. Threaded inserts: Installing a threaded insert in the wood can provide a more solid and durable base for the bolt to be thread into. Threaded inserts are metal sleeves that are installed in a pre-drilled hole and can then receive the bolt without causing damage to the wood over time. 8. Periodic inspection and maintenance: To ensure long-term bolt security, perform regular inspections of the bolt and nut connections, checking for signs of loosening, wood damage, or corrosion. Tighten or replace the bolts as needed to maintain a secure connection. 9. Combine with adhesives: In some cases, using adhesives like wood glue or epoxy in conjunction with bolts can create a stronger and more secure hold. Apply the adhesive to the wood surfaces before joining them together and inserting the bolt. However, this option may not be suitable for connections that need to be disassembled or adjusted in the future. 10. Consider using alternative fasteners: Depending on the application, it might be worth exploring other types of fasteners, such as wood screws, dowels, or metal brackets. These alternatives can sometimes provide better holding power and ease of installation. By implementing these techniques, you can ensure that the bolt stays securely inserted in the piece of wood, providing a long-lasting, strong, and sturdy connection for your project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, based on the options provided and the situation described, I will outline some possible explanations. I. She may mistake my truck as a pillar. It seems unlikely that she would mistake your truck for a stationary pillar, but it is possible that she did not recognize the size or position of your vehicle relative to her car. In such a case, she might not have realized that she was moving into your lane and cutting you off. II. None of the above choices. While none of the specific choices may apply in this instance, it is important to consider that there may be other factors at play that we are not aware of based on the information provided. III. She may not be paying attention to the traffic on the roadway. This seems like a plausible explanation, as the woman may have been distracted by something inside or outside her vehicle, or she could have simply been daydreaming or lost in thought. In any case, a lack of attention to her surroundings could have led her to move into your lane without realizing that your truck was there. IV. My truck may be in her blind spot. Blind spots are areas around a vehicle that are not visible to the driver through their mirrors or peripheral vision. It is possible that your truck was in the woman's blind spot when she decided to change lanes, making her unaware of your presence. This scenario is further supported by your description of your truck being in your own \\"A\\" pillar blind spot, as the position of your vehicle relative to hers could very well have placed you in her blind spot as well. Overall, in this particular situation, it seems most likely that a combination of factors (such as not paying attention to the traffic on the roadway and your truck being in her blind spot) could have contributed to the woman moving into your lane without realizing your truck was there."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Title: Bridging Alaska Genre: Drama, Adventure Plot: Our story begins with Chester Davis (played by Chris Evans), a wildlife photographer in his mid-30s, living a successful life in Los Angeles. Although he has money and fame, deep down, Chester feels a void in his life. He yearns for purpose beyond materialistic success. In an effort to change his life, Chester decides to take a significant break from his LA life and embarks upon a journey to Alaska to explore its natural wonders. Upon arrival, Chester meets Amara Clarke (played by Zoe Saldana), a local tour guide, and environmental activist. Amara agrees to show Chester around the Alaskan wilderness. The two instantly develop a strong bond as they come to realize their shared love for nature. As the days turn to weeks, Chester becomes increasingly captivated by Alaska's stunning landscapes and the way life thrives there. He finds particular interest in the diverse wildlife, focusing on capturing the beauty of their existence on his camera. Through his artistic eye, Chester begins to expose the harsh effects of climate change on Alaska's fragile ecosystem. During their journey, Amara introduces Chester to her grandfather, Joseph Clarke (played by Morgan Freeman), a wise and respected indigenous Alaskan elder. Joseph shares with Chester the ancient knowledge and traditions of the native people whose lives have been deeply connected with the land for generations. Chester's appreciation for Alaska deepens, and he begins to question what it truly means to be home and what he can do to protect this newfound paradise. One day, Amara brings Chester to a secluded island known for its unique fauna and flora. Unbeknownst to them, a corporation has plans to build a bridge connecting this island to the mainland, leading to the imminent destruction of the incredible biodiversity found there. Chester and Amara discover the corporation's plans and embark on a quest to expose the proposed bridge's environmental impact and protect the island for future generations. As public awareness of the issue grows, Chester uses his fame and platform to advocate against the bridge and further explore the effects of climate change on the region. He joins forces with Amara and other environmental groups to rally the local community to protest the bridge's construction. The story garners national attention, forcing the corporation itself to reconsider its plans. In the end, Chester's efforts lead to the cancellation of the bridge project, saving the island and its unique ecosystem, thus emphasizing the power of people united for a cause. Having fulfilled his purpose, Chester decides to return to Los Angeles but promises to come back and continue his work in Alaska with Amara and her community. As the story concludes, Chester is seen back in LA, changed by his Alaskan journey. Through his experiences, he has learned that home isn't just a physical place, but rather where your heart and purpose lie. The movie wraps up as Chester displays his stunning Alaskan photographs in a gallery, inspiring others to care for our planet and its diverse ecosystems. \\"Bridging Alaska\\" not only highlights the vulnerability of our world's natural beauty but also shows that one person's determination and passion can inspire a world of change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Local Government Association says a shortfall in children's services budgets will reach £2bn by 2020. The LGA calculates that the shortfall will be £100m more than was suggested by its previous analysis last October, which had put it at £1.9bn. The government said its reforms would deliver quality care for all children. There is already evidence of a funding gap, according to the LGA, with councils having spent £600m more than they had budgeted for in the year 2015-16. It says the overspend is due to increased demand for children's social care, accompanied by cuts to funding from central government, along with inflation. The LGA says that population changes mean extra services will be needed, likely to cost an extra £1.1bn each year by 2019-20. At the same time, reductions to central government grants mean children's services budgets will be down £900m a year, even if councils raise business rates and council taxes to the maximum allowed under government rules, it adds. The LGA is calling for urgent action to address this widening funding gap and warns that services in many areas are \\"being pushed to breaking point\\". It points to significant increases in demand in recent years: Tough decisions on how to allocate scarce resources mean early intervention services have been cut and families must reach crisis point before they receive help, warns the LGA. \\"There are very few savings left to find without having a real and lasting impact upon crucial services that many children and families across the country desperately rely on,\\" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board. \\"Early intervention can help to limit the need for children to enter the social care system, lay the groundwork for improved performance at school and even help to ease future pressure on adult social care by reducing the pressure on services for vulnerable adults. \\"However, councils are in a difficult situation where they are struggling to invest in this vital early help and support.\\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \\"We want every single child, no matter where they live, to receive the same high quality care and support - and this is exactly what our reforms are set up to deliver. \\"We are clear that providing help as early as possible is the most effective way of keeping children safe, and our new What Works Centre for children's social care will ensure social workers across the country are able to learn from best practice.\\" What Works is a government-led initiative to enable commissioners of public services to access independent evidence across a  range of social policy areas.

This is the best answer because it demonstrates the proactive and determined mindset necessary for someone to achieve their dreams. By springing into action, the person is actively seeking the opportunities and working tirelessly to get closer to their desired goals. Accepting his fate would imply that the person has given up on the possibility of achieving their dreams and is resigned to living a life that doesn't align with their aspirations. This is not the best answer because it doesn't reflect an attitude of actively striving for success. Crossing the street is an unrelated action in this context and doesn't have any direct impact on the person's efforts to achieve their dreams. It is a mundane action that does not show any intent of working towards a specific goal. Feeling upset can be considered a natural reaction to setbacks or obstacles when trying to achieve one's dreams. However, this is not the best answer because getting upset or feeling discouraged does not actively contribute to achieving success. It is crucial to acknowledge emotions, but it's also vital to not let them hinder one's progress. Traveling to Europe might be relevant to the person's dreams if their aspirations pertain to this continent or if it offers opportunities to work towards their goals. However, merely traveling to Europe without the context of springing into action does not guarantee that the person will achieve their dreams. Therefore, it is not the best answer.

The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday.

JUST CAUSE showcases Sean Connery as a Harvard law prof, Kate Capshaw (does she still get work?) as his wife (slight age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern cop (!) and Ed Harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer. Weird casting, but the movie plays serious mindf** with the audience. (don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers) First of all, I felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the Liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence. The coroner, witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. Connery is a Harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty. He is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial. Connery is stonewalled (yawn...) by the small town officials and the good IL' boys club but finds that the case against Blair, the alleged killer, now on death row, was all fabricated. The main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him. The beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even played Russian roulette to get the confession out of him. Connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting, Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris, he finds out where Harris hid the murder weapon. He gets a re-trial and Blair is freed. I think... film over.... Then suddenly! It turns out that Blair IS a psychotic psycho and that he used \\"white guilt\\" to enlist Connery. He concocted the story with Ed Harris in return for Blair carrying out a few murders for Harris. now Blair is on the loose again, thanks to Connery's deluded PC principles! The final 30 min. are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama, Connery and Fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts (yes, you read that right) in the everglades. That was one weird film. So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are all just bullies and Abu Graib type torturers, but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry.

Here is a step-by-step solution: 1. Start with the given equation: -420 = -176*s + 1868 2. We want to isolate s, so we need to move the constants (numbers without variables) to the opposite side of the equation. To do this, subtract 1868 from both sides of the equation:    -420 - 1868 = -176*s + 1868 - 1868 3. Perform the subtraction from step 2:    -2288 = -176*s 4. Now, we want to get s by itself. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -176:    -2288/-176 = -176*s/-176 5.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  By 1911, Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

Before you make call using the internet, make sure you’re connected to a WiFi source and not using cellular data.  To make sure you aren’t using data, you can turn it off in your phone’s settings. On an iPhone, for instance, go to Settings, then choose Cellular. Switch the toggle button next to “Cellular Data” off. A lot of places offer free WiFi now.

Article: Take care of how you look and smell especially if you are growing up quickly. You may notice that you sweat a lot more or that you smell very bad. These are not attractive qualities so be sure to shower and wear deodorant every day. Also remember to brush your teeth and style your hair. Keeping basic hygiene makes sure that she does not get grossed out.  Always stay fresh and clean even when you're not in school because if you run into her friends in the mall and they think that you smell, the rumour will spread quickly back to her. Without even knowing it, you may have already blown your chance. Take deodorant to school with you, if allowed, in your sports kit on P.E. days. While each girl will like her own specific style, take pride in how your dress. Have confidence in your appearance and know what works for you. You want to feel comfortable in your outfits so that it will be one less thing to worry about. This does NOT mean forcing your friends to ask out a girl on your behalf but it can mean using them to help you look better or find out information about her. It also has the added effect of showing that you are a sociable person and fun to be around. If you aren't friends already, introduce yourself when you are working in a group or when you are sitting next to each other. Talk to her in class, but don't be obnoxious. Don't talk to her too much, just say hi when you find yourself around her or wave if you see her around school.  Talk to her whenever the opportunity presents itself. Start by simply asking, \\"How's it going?\\" Don't be creepy or awkward by lingering at her location without saying something. If you have nothing to say, don’t force it. Just greet her and move along. Make sure to make a good impression on them as they are her first line of defense. If she is much more popular than you, or in a different social circle, more effort will be required. Try and talk to that group to get closer to her, and be seen in a different light. A girl is much more likely to go out with you if you have gained her trust and respect on a friendship level. Start slow and chat as acquaintances. Don't be too eager to please her. Leave her intrigued and looking forward to her next encounter with you. Becoming friends can happen by sitting next to her in class, teaming up with her for class projects, interacting with her friends, or getting her number or social media handles to chat. Find a topic that interests you both and chat with her as often as you can. Don't be afraid to ask questions and to change topics so that you can continue the conversation and, more importantly, get to know more about her. Don't try to force a conversation and make things awkward with silence. It's okay to end a conversation if you don't feel like it's flowing in your favour.  Try to find common hobbies and interests. For example, you may chat about video games because there are a surprising number of girls that enjoy them as much as boys. Local sports teams are also a great topic to chat about. For example, you can say \\"Hey, did you catch last night's game?\\" If she's sad ask \\"What's wrong\\" and if she doesn't want to tell you about it then say \\"We're friends, you know I would understand\\" Know that you are you're own person and that she should like you for who you are. It's okay to have your own opinion. Disagreeing with her or not liking something that she likes is okay. If she doesn't like you for your opinion then you know it wasn't meant to be, but always respect others and yourself. If your opinion is rude or disrespectful, you may have other problems to address.  If you make body jokes, do it in moderation. If you do it too much you will come off as crude and immature. if you do it in moderation you may make her laugh and come off self confident if you joke about yourself. Do not be a disrespectful or a bully. People are allowed to have their own opinion. Make sure that you're able to have an open conversation without turning it into a shouting match or worse. Open doors for her and help her carry her books without her having to ask for it. Girls really love these small sweet gestures of kindness and they will notice it. You don't have to buy her an expensive gift for her birthday to make her happy when you can give her something sentimental like a small key chain of a funny joke you two shared. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, maintaining good hygiene, presenting yourself well, and developing a genuine connection are essential steps to follow when trying to impress a girl. Start by ensuring your appearance is clean and tidy, and engage in conversations with her to find common interests. Build a friendship and gain her trust through mutual respect and open communication. Show kindness through small gestures, respecting opinions, and avoiding crude jokes.

He found an interesting table that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two different times, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's climatic condition in the previous century. And, time B showed earth's climatic condition in the present century. Keith was amazed to see how the world has changed in just a century.  But I can use this background: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.  What is an answer for this question: Which period would be more harmful for habitat of species, time A or time B? Answer:","output":"Time B would be more harmful for the habitat of species. The reason is that during Time B, the present century, the Earth's climate has continued to change more rapidly due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels. This has resulted in higher average global temperatures and more frequent and severe climatic events, such as heatwaves, storms, and droughts. Species and their habitats are facing increased stress from these environmental changes, making it more difficult for them to adapt and survive. Furthermore, global warming threatens biodiversity and ecosystem stability, as even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for some organisms. In contrast, Time A, the previous century, experienced lower levels of human-driven climate change, making it a comparatively less harmful period for species' habitats."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: what happened to stevie ray vaughan I found the following answer on Google: Often referred to by his initials SRV, Vaughan is best known as a founding member and leader of Double Trouble .

Answer:","output":"The movie produced by Uri Singer that stars the actress who won critical acclaim with her appearance as Lydia Deetz in Tim Burton's \\"Beetlejuice\\" is \\"The Experimenter.\\" The talented actress in question is Winona Ryder, who has had an illustrious career in Hollywood since her breakthrough role as the gothic teenager, Lydia Deetz. \\"The Experimenter,\\" directed by Michael Almereyda, was released in 2015 and is a biographical drama film based on the life of social psychologist Stanley Milgram. The film delves into Milgram's infamous experiments conducted at Yale University in the early 1960s. These experiments aimed to study obedience and authority by persuading subjects to administer electric shocks to another person (an actor pretending to be in pain), who they could not see, under the supervision of an authoritative scientist. Winona Ryder plays the character of Sasha Menkin Milgram, Stanley Milgram's wife. Their relationship is explored throughout the film, providing insights into the life of the famous psychologist beyond his experiments. As the film's lead actress, Ryder delivers a nuanced and powerful performance that adds depth and humanity to the story. \\"The Experimenter\\" is an impressive addition to the prolific career of Winona Ryder, who is known for her diverse range of roles in films such as \\"Heathers\\" (1988), \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" (1990), \\"Dracula\\" (1992), \\"Little Women\\" (1994), \\"Reality Bites\\" (1994), and most recently, the popular Netflix series \\"Stranger Things\\" (2016-present). Uri Singer has produced a handful of critically acclaimed films, with \\"The Experimenter\\" being one of the most notable examples. Its examination of the human condition, obedience, and morality, coupled with Ryder's inspiring performance, make it a compelling piece of cinema."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: “Hedge fund hotel” stocks—stocks with a very high concentration of hedge-fund ownership—have been on a losing streak lately. They’ve been underperforming the broader market, as well as stocks with very low hedge fund ownership, as investors have slashed their risky bets. If the stock market’s volatility continues or picks up, experts expect hedge funds’ most loved stocks to be especially vulnerable. “I want to be short those,” the famed short-seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, known for betting against Enron, tells Fortune. Short selling, of course, can expose you to losses, so typical investors might do better just to avoid these three hedgie favorites—each of which has at least a fifth of its shares owned by hedge funds. Autodesk, which makes design software, is a hedge fund favorite, with 27% ownership. Those investors include activists ­Sachem Head and Eminence Capital, which together scored three board seats in March. That’s not necessarily good: Autodesk’s CEO previously slammed the activists as short-term players whose demands “would almost guarantee [the ­company] would have no long-term future.” Autodesk is on track to lose money this year for the second year in a row, yet it trades at more than 142 times what it earned the last time it was profitable.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 17:41 EST, 9 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:41 EST, 9 May 2013. Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant has scored a victory in an ongoing legal battle with his own mother, who planned to auction off more than a million dollars’ worth of his sports memorabilia. This week, a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Goldin Auctions barring the auction house from selling Bryant's basketball jerseys, jackets, high school championship rings, trophies and other collectibles pending a full hearing. The New Jersey-based auction business has filed a complaint claiming that Bryant's mother, Pamela Bryant, put up for sale a large collection of sports memorabilia, which she had received as a gift from her millionaire son. The items numbering in the hundreds were expected to fetch around 1.5million. Family feud: Lakers star Kobe Bryant has accused his mother, Pamela (pictured) of selling his valuable collection of memorabilia, and even stealing some of the items from his home. He said, she said: Kobe Bryant (left) insisted that his mother (right) was never given consent to take his collectibles and sell them, but Pamela Bryant claims her son had given her permission to auction them off. Earlier this year, Mrs Bryant joined forces with the Berlin, New Jersey-based Goldin Auctions to sell the sports mementos from her son's high school days and early NBA career. In return, Pamela Bryant received a 450,000 advance, which she in turn used to buy a house in Nevada. However, the 34-year-old athlete, who is currently recovering from a season-ending injury to his Achilles’ tendon, filed his own complaint against the auction house insisting that he had never given his mother permission to sell his memorabilia. Mr Bryant went on to stay in his court filing that his mother stole some of his personal items from his house, TMZ reported. 'I never told my mother that she could have my personal property, let alone consign it for public auction,' Bryant wrote. According to the complaint filed Wednesday in US District Court in Camden, New Jersey, the Lakers shooting guard claimed that Mrs Bryant admitted to him recently that she was never given consent to sell his possessions. 'I confronted her about her false. statement that I had given my memorabilia to her,' Bryant wrote in the filing cited by ESPN. 'I said. to her, \\"Mom, you know I never told you that you could have the. memorabilia.\\" 'Her response. was, \\"Yes, but you never said you wanted it, either.\\" Of course, this is. untrue, since my wife and I requested that she return my memorabilia. several years earlier.' Last. week, Kobe Bryant's lawyers demanded that Goldin Auctions scrap the. scheduled June sale. In response, the auction house sued the athlete for. the right to go ahead with the sale of The Kobe Bryant Collection. Mr. Bryant has emphasized that he was only suing the auctioneers and not. his mother, but both he and his wife, Vanessa, had testified in writing. that Pamela Bryant took the memorabilia and put it on the auction block. without their permission, and then refused to return the prized. possessions. Bryant said in. a sworn statement that the items at the center of the dispute  go back. to his teenage years have 'tremendous sentimental value,' adding that he. was planning to hand down his 'well-deserved memorabilia’  to his. children, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Bryant said his mother can claim ownership of only two items, NBA Championship rings that he had custom-made for his parents. For sale: An advertisement for an auction of items belonging to Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is seen just before the basketball star ordered the auction house to stop. Deal: A lawsuit by the New Jersey auction house claims that Kobe Bryant's mother Pamela Bryant, seen beside his father Joe Bryant, already struck a deal with them for the items' sale. Vanessa. Bryant also weighed in on the mother-son spat, stating that when. confronted about the items, her mother-in-law agreed to return theme,. but said that she had moved all the jerseys and championship mementos to. a storage facility. Attorneys for both sides in the legal dispute will present their arguments in the case May 20 in Camden. The disagreement is a high-value,. high-profile version of a question many families face: Can Mom get rid. of the stuff a grown child left at home? In this case, the 900 mementos happen to be worth upward of 1.5 million. Among. the first 100 or so items Pamela Bryant intends to sell: the NBA star's. jerseys, practice gear and sweatsuits from Lower Merion High School;. varsity letters; a trophy for being the outstanding player at the 1995. Adidas ABCD basketball camp; and a signed basketball from the 2000 NBA. championship game. And. then there are rings, for the 1996 Pennsylvania high school. championship, a pair that the Lakers made for Bryant's parents for the. 2000 NBA championship and one from the 1998 NBA All-Star game. According. to court filings, Pamela Bryant struck a deal in January with Goldin. Auctions in Berlin, N.J., which earlier this year sold a rare Honus. Wagner baseball card for a record 2.1 million. In its court filings, Goldin says. Pamela Bryant told the auction house that she asked her son five years. ago what he wanted to do with the items that were in her home. 'Kobe Bryant indicated to Pamela. Bryant that the items belonged to her and that he had no interest in. them,' the auction house's attorneys wrote. So she put them in a. 1,500-per-month New Jersey storage unit. Gifted: A Los Angeles Lakers championship ring given by Kobe to his father Joe Bryant is seen among the items the auction house hopes to sell. Fair game: Two Lower Merion High School basketball jerseys worn by Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant are seen for sale though Bryant contends that his mother doesn't have the right to sell the collectibles. Price tag: The 900 items belonging to Bryant, seen with his wife Vanessa at a cancer research benefit on Thursday, could bring in upward of 1.5 million. The challenge came last Tuesday when Goldin sent a news release announcing the auction. By day's end, Kobe Bryant's lawyer had sent a cease-and-desist letter telling the auction house to call off the sale and return the items to him. Kenneth Goldin, owner of the auction house, says he can't cancel the auction because he's already advanced 450,000 to Bryant's mother and put money into advertising the auction. Kobe Bryant's lawyer Mark Campbell said in a statement, 'Mr. Bryant's personal property has ended up in the possession of someone who does not lawfully own it. We look forward to resolving this legal matter through the legal system.' Bryant has had a sometimes icy relationship with his mother and father, Joe 'Jellybean' Bryant, a former pro basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers who is now coaching in Thailand.

The NHS is expected to see 95% of A&E patients in four hours. Nationally, this has not been met on a weekly basis since September. In Somerset, Yeovil District and the Royal United Hospital in Bath have both been on \\"black alert\\" this winter with Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton on \\"red alert\\" due to the pressure on A and E services. Liberal Democrat Tessa Munt said the most important thing was to \\"get people out of acute hospitals as soon as possible and as soon as it is safe, and into community hospitals\\". James Heappey for the Conservatives, agreed with Ms Munt, saying patients need to be moved out of wards to convalesce at home and be visited by a carer, or moved into community hospitals. Chris Inchley from Labour said bed blocking was \\"a major issue\\" and said the social care system in Somerset and the health service needed to be \\"joined up better\\". UKIP candidate Helen Hims said her party would bring in \\"a pilot programme to put GPs on duty in A&E departments seven days a week\\".

These leader-people all agreed that sometimes, people have to wait too long to see a doctor. Especially in places where people go when they get very sick very quickly, like the hospital's emergency room. They've set a goal that they should see almost all the people who come to the emergency room in less than four hours but they haven't been doing so well at that goal since around when school starts in the fall. Two hospitals in a place called Somerset, and another hospital, have all been really busy this winter.

Another man named James agreed with Tessa, but also thought maybe some patients could get better at home with someone to help take care of them. A man called Chris pointed out a problem where patients who can't leave the hospital beds causes issues, and said the health service and social care system need to work together better. A woman named Helen said they should test having doctors at the emergency room all week.

He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him.\\" In 2013, Waters said he had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the...

In the jungle they find empty cages, plants with a neurotoxic poison that Edwin collects on a scalpel, and a deceased US Special Forces soldier. Arriving at higher ground, they find themselves staring at an alien sky and realize that they are not on Earth. The party is attacked by a pack of quadruped alien beasts. Cuchillo is killed, and his body is then used as bait to lure the survivors into a trap, but they avoid it.

Please answer this question: what is the highest temperature ever recorded in the us?","output":"The highest temperature ever recorded in the United States occurred in Death Valley, California, on July 10, 1913. On that day, the temperature reached a scorching 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.7 degrees Celsius). This measurement was taken at the Furnace Creek Ranch (previously known as Greenland Ranch), which is located in the heart of Death Valley National Park, one of the hottest and driest places on the planet. Death Valley, a desert valley located in Eastern California within the Mojave Desert, is known for its extreme weather conditions, searing heat, and staggeringly low humidity levels. Due to its unique geological features, such as its below-sea-level basin and high surrounding mountain ranges, air temperatures in Death Valley can soar to unbearable levels during the summer months. It is worth mentioning that there was another temperature record of 136.4 degrees Fahrenheit (58 degrees Celsius) recorded on September 13, 1922, in Al Azizia, Libya. However, after an in-depth investigation by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), this reading was declared invalid in 2012 due to various inconsistencies and issues with the measurement process. Consequently, the 1913 Death Valley reading remains the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth's surface. The extreme heat in Death Valley and other parts of the US has various consequences, such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and dehydration for living beings. Additionally, these soaring temperatures can exacerbate drought conditions, increase wildfire risk, and contribute to a myriad of environmental and ecological problems. While the high temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit in Death Valley is an extreme record, it serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by humans, animals, and plants that inhabit such harsh environments. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of continued research and monitoring of temperature extremes to better understand the impacts of climate change and how best to adapt and respond to these changes in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and kilims not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to mosques, which often amassed large collections of them.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The art of carpet weaving first gained significant prominence in the nomadic cultures of Central Asia. This region, comprising modern-day countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, is known for their rich and diverse tapestry of art, including the intricate craftsmanship of carpet weaving. The nomadic tribes of Central Asia found carpet weaving particularly suitable for their way of life because the rugs served as easily transportable forms of furnishing. These carpets were not merely decorative objects but carried immense practical value as well. They were designed to provide warmth and insulation, especially as nomadic tribes lived in harsh and barren landscapes with extreme weather conditions. Additionally, the carpets symbolized the tribe’s wealth and social status, playing a fundamental role in their culture and traditions. As these nomadic tribes interacted with neighboring regions, the art of carpet weaving started spreading across other areas, eventually reaching Anatolia. The arrival of the Turks in this region played a crucial role in further popularizing and refining the craft of carpet weaving. As the Ottoman Empire emerged and began to conquer new territories, the art continued to flourish, ultimately making it synonymous with the empire's grandeur, wealth, and taste in fine arts. In the context of the Ottoman Empire, the role of carpets extended beyond practical use. They were considered both a luxury item and an essential part of the daily life, taking on religious and symbolic meanings. This could be observed in their use in residences, where it was customary to remove one's shoes. Carpets adorned not just the floors but also the walls and doorways, enhancing insulation and creating a plush domestic environment. Moreover, the tradition of donating carpets to mosques further amplified their religious and cultural significance. These carpets, often featuring intricate patterns and luxurious materials, embellished the sacred spaces and represented a way to honor the divine. As a result, mosques often accumulated vast collections of sumptuous carpets, reflecting the devotion and wealth of their patrons. In conclusion, the art of carpet weaving first gained significance in the nomadic cultures of Central Asia. Over time, it found its way to Anatolia, where it flourished under the patronage of the Ottoman Empire, transforming the craft into a decorative and functional object imbued with religious symbolism and cultural importance. Today, the legacy of this art form can be seen in the continued appreciation and collection of these carpets worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Street musicians played uplifting tunes around every corner, and the tantalizing aroma of food from various world cuisines greeted us. Cozy cafes and bustling restaurants lined the streets, inviting visitors to sit down and enjoy a delicious meal. The local markets offered fresh produce and handmade items, while stylish boutiques showcased the trendiest clothing and accessories. The uniqueness of each establishment appealed to us, as every shop seemed to have its own story to tell. Moreover, the downtown community was diverse and welcoming. People from all walks of life could be seen walking the streets, and open-minded conversations took place around every corner. The community embraced art and culture in a way that the uptown neighborhood had forgotten. Street art adorned the walls of buildings, and local galleries displayed the work of talented artists, both well-established and emerging. We found a sense of camaraderie and unity within this downtown community that was missing from the declining neighborhood uptown. In addition to the vibrant cultural atmosphere, downtown boasted a flourishing job market. With many innovative startups, coworking spaces, and countless networking opportunities, we saw the potential to both find and create our own career paths.

With a well-rounded curriculum and focus on both the arts and sciences, the schools prepared students to excel in the ever-changing global landscape. After considering all these factors, we knew that moving downtown was the right decision for us. We engaged a local real estate agent who quickly helped us find the perfect place in the heart of the downtown area. Upon moving, we began to make friends and connections within the community that would prove invaluable over time. The more we immersed ourselves in the downtown lifestyle, the more we realized that we had made the right choice.

In his zeal to promote nuclear power, filmmaker Robert Stone inserted numerous half-truths and less-than-half-truths in his new documentary \\"Pandora's Promise,\\" which CNN is airing on November 7. One of Stone's more misleading allegations was that scientists at a U.S. research facility, the Argonne National Laboratory, were on the verge of developing a breakthrough technology that could solve nuclear power's numerous problems when the Clinton administration and its allies in Congress shut the program in 1994 for purely political reasons. Like the story of Pandora itself, the tale of the integral fast reactor (IFR) -- or at least the version presented in the movie -- is more myth than reality. In the final assessment, the concept's drawbacks greatly outweighed its advantages.

Write an article with the title: \\"Should bankers be paid in bonds?\\"","output":"Title: Should Bankers Be Paid in Bonds? Introduction: Bankers have traditionally been compensated in various ways, including salaries, annual bonuses, stock options, and other performance-based rewards. With the increasing public scrutiny over excessive bonus payments and the growing interest in aligning compensation with long-term, responsible performance, the idea of paying bankers in bonds has gained traction. This article explores the concept of bond-based compensation for bankers and weighs its potential risks and benefits. Step 1: Understanding Bond-Based Compensation Paying bankers in bonds means compensating them at least partially in the form of long-term debt instruments rather than traditional cash bonuses or stock options. The goal of this approach is to encourage responsible risk-taking, reducing the likelihood of situations like the financial crisis of 2008, where short-term profit maximization by some financial institutions led to significant losses for investors and taxpayers. Step 2: Analyzing the Advantages 1. Aligns interests with long-term financial stability: Bond-based compensation can incentivize bankers to make decisions that prioritize a bank's long-term success rather than just short-term profits. This can lead to more sustainable growth and reduce the chance of crises caused by short-sighted risk-taking. 2. Reduces excessive risk-taking: Paying bankers in bonds can motivate them to avoid high-risk investments that could jeopardize their payouts. Bonds are a more conservative investment vehicle, being less volatile than stocks and usually offering a fixed-income over time. This risk-averse profile can help to instill a culture of responsible investing in the banking industry. 3. Encourages better compliance and ethical practices: As bankers are directly financially tied to the bank's success, they will be more inclined to ensure they adhere to regulations, minimize conduct risk, and maintain good relationships with regulators and stakeholders. Step 3: Considering Potential Drawbacks 1. Attractiveness to top talent: It may be more challenging for banks to attract top talent if their compensation packages are perceived as less competitive than those of their peers. Talented bankers might prefer to work for institutions that offer traditional cash bonuses or stock-based compensation, which are often seen as more attractive and lucrative opportunities. 2. Motivation for short-term gains: Bankers paid in bonds might still find ways to boost short-term profits or manipulate performance metrics that determine their bonuses. This could undermine the intended goal of promoting long-term stability and responsible decision-making. 3. The behavior of bondholders: It could be argued that bondholders are not always focused on long-term financial stability. During times of financial stress, bondholders may be motivated to sell particular bonds, which could depress bond prices and lead to unintended market disruptions. Conclusion: Paying bankers in bonds is an approach worth considering for aligning banker interests with long-term financial stability and reducing excessive risk-taking. However, it is essential to be aware of potential drawbacks, such as the challenge of attracting top talent and the possibility of still fostering short-term profit maximization. Banks should carefully weigh the pros and cons of bond-based compensation and work towards creating a compensation structure that achieves a balance between financial stability and competitiveness in the market."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: While I was in training, my class was 2 months out from graduation.

Title: The Eagle of the Ninth Movie plot: The Year is A.D. 140, and it has been 20 years since Rome's legendary Ninth Legion marched north into Caledonia (modern Scotland) to gain control over all of Britain. The Legion was completely defeated, to Rome's embarrassment, and the Legion's prized standard, a golden eagle, captured. Marcus Flavius Aquila (Channing Tatum) is the son of the Legion's General, and is determined to exonerate his father and the family name. Choosing Britain for his first active station, he must prove himself to his men when local Barbarian tribes, led by an angry Druid, attack the fort at night.Marcus senses the attack and wakes his men in time. They fight the intruders and win the battle, but the next day the Druid returns with prisoners of war - an expedition Marcus had sent out to find a grain convoy. The leader of the expedition is beheaded before their eyes.Unwilling to bear the guilt of his men's death, Marcus leads the best of his men out of the fort. Using their shields and proven Roman infantry battle tactics, they push back the Celts and defend the prisoners. They have started moving back to the fort when the Druid summons his chariots, which race forward with scythes on the wheels and hack down the retreating men. Marcus grabs a spear, steadies his aim, and launches it toward the Druid. The spear kills the driver, causing the chariot to topple onto Marcus.With his leg badly injured, Marcus is sent to his Uncle (Donald Sutherland)'s house to recover.

Summarize this article: But political analysts are sceptical about whether Jordan will be able to realise the changes demanded by street protesters since January. Jordanian demonstrators are calling for the election of the prime minister by popular vote, want to see corruption seriously tackled and unemployment - which tops 13% - alleviated. Protests here have been smaller and mainly peaceful, with no calls for the king to be removed. The king has responded by establishing a national dialogue committee tasked with amending the constitution to give the public greater political say. Last week, the absolute monarch also unveiled a new system to select future cabinets. Starting next year he will involve parliament in forming cabinets until prime ministers can be popularly elected. The king also wants to see Jordan's 33 political parties merge into political groupings such as left, right and centre from which a prime minister can emerge. He has said this process could take up to three years. But independent analyst Labib Kamhawi called this tinkering with the system as a \\"waste of time\\". \\"There is no need to establish such a mechanism. Parliamentary governments are well-defined,\\" he said. \\"The problem lies in the system which prohibits political parties from taking their lawful share in parliament by manipulating the process itself by rigging elections.\\" Political observers and members of the opposition, including the powerful Islamic Action Front (IAF), allege that widespread election fraud took place during the last two parliamentary elections. The IAF, which is affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood, said they were deprived of votes in the 2007 elections and boycotted the 2010 polls as a result. Mr Kamhawi and other analysts such as University of Jordan international relations professor Hassan Barari accuse Jordan's all-pervasive security services, special interest groups and members of the ruling elite of undermining the drive for reform in the country. \\"The ruling elite, by this I mean the bureaucracy, corrupt politicians and businessmen, have no interest in giving people genuine reforms,\\" Mr Barari said. \\"The king has realised that the status quo is untenable and swift moves to contain the street are needed. That's why he started constitutional amendments, some political reforms and firing the weakest government in a decade.\\" On 17 October, the unpopular Prime Minister Marouf al-Bakhit stepped down a day after 70 out of 120 parliamentarians called for him to go. A tough ex-army general, Mr Bakhit was viewed as incapable of enacting needed reforms and his time in office had been tainted by charges of corruption. The king appointed the respected jurist and former deputy of the Hague-based International Court of Justice, Awn al-Khasawneh, as the third prime minister to take the job since protests broke out in January. Mr Khasawneh's government is the tenth since Abdullah ascended the throne in 1999. This turnover is pretty much traditional in Jordan. The king's father, King Hussein, also changed cabinets about every eight months during his reign. Mr Barari of the University of Jordan said the king cannot keep prime ministers in office for a longer time because people in the street would \\"explode\\". The prime ministers deflect criticism and work as a \\"buffer\\", while the monarch is viewed as responding to people's demands for change. Observers also criticised some of the king's past choices for the post and said the endless cycle of cabinet reshuffles should be broken. \\"Parliament should select a prime minister and cabinet. A government should be the outcome of political balances within parliament,\\" said Mr Barari. \\"A good electoral law and no state interference in elections are required. Let the people decide who their representatives are. Parliament will then appoint the prime minister,\\" he added. Prime Minister Khasawneh has announced that \\"there will be no more rigged elections\\" in Jordan. \\"The country will not tolerate any more manipulation in any future elections.\\" How will this be accomplished? He said the government will set up an independent organisation to oversee municipal and parliamentary elections. But the fact that the government is once again involved would seem to undermine the independence of the monitoring group. Shadi Hamid and Courtney Freer of the Brookings Center in Doha called the king's tactic of replacing his prime ministers as a means to \\"demonstrate his seriousness about change\\". But they also said the Jordanian monarchy has a \\"long history of pledging reform yet failing to deliver, beginning in 1989 with an initially promising but soon aborted democratic experiment\\". King Abdullah recently urged parliamentarians to devise a political parties' law and amend a controversial election bill, which Islamist and other opposition claim has provided pro-monarchy landslide victories and produced weak parliaments. While these measures are necessary to the political reform process, Mr Kamhawi still faults the powers that be with delays to realising true democratic transformation in Jordan. \\"At the end of the day, it boils down to what compromise the king is willing to live with. It seems to be that we have not yet reached that point,\\" he said. And Shadi Hamid and Courtney Freer argue that while King Abdullah is often seen to be above the political fray he, \\"like all dominant monarchs, is at least partly responsible for the stagnation of political reform in Jordan\\". For the first time in decades, youth, Islamist and leftist opposition protesters are challenging the monarchy's grip on power. Analysts are warning that although deference to the king persists, it may not last forever. Summary:","output":"Since January, street protesters in Jordan have been demanding political changes, including the election of the prime minister by popular vote, addressing corruption and alleviating unemployment, which is currently over 13%.

Judge Jeff Sessions by What He Does Next President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to be the next U.S. attorney general has raised an understandable furor. To be sure, Sessions isn’t likely to be the last among Trump’s nominees for the 1,000 positions requiring Senate confirmation to arrive dragging unhappy baggage, and there’s no point in everyone getting outraged at all of them. A bit of history, however, might help the doubters decide how to think about Sessions -- and, perhaps more important, help Sessions understand what he owes to the doubters. First, a bit of background on the nominee. In 1986, Sessions became the first of President Ronald Reagan’s nominees for a federal judgeship to be defeated. The reason, we are now told, was that he had made “racially insensitive” statements. He had indeed. His comments included the opinion that the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP were “un-American” (a remark he said under oath that he did not recall making) and a stupid joke about how he thought members of the Ku Klux Klan “were O.K. until I found out they smoked pot” (a remark for which he apologized). That was lot to swallow in 1986, and it’s a lot to swallow today. Abraham Lincoln famously said that in politics the statute of limitations should be short. But how short should it be? In the case of Sessions, as it turns out, history affords us a useful analogue. In 1959, the state of Georgia elected as its governor Samuel Ernest Vandiver, who during his campaign had pledged that under his administration “neither my three children, nor any of yours, will ever attend a racially mixed school or college in this state.” He promised that no black students -- “no, not one” -- would ever be admitted to a white public school. Among his advisers at the time was a young Atlanta lawyer named Griffin B. Bell. In 1961, President John Kennedy appointed Bell to the federal appellate bench. When Jimmy Carter was elected president in 1976, he chose Bell to be his attorney general. These and other details of Bell’s past came out. He belonged to lily-white clubs. His civil-rights jurisprudence was said to “give clear signals and hope to those in this country who would want to do less than provide equal educational opportunity.” The NAACP fought his confirmation fiercely. I was a first-year law student at the time, and as details of Bell’s past emerged, I was every bit as furious as everyone else I knew. When in early January he was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Democratic-led Senate, a lot of us saw evidence that Dixie had indeed risen again and was now in charge. But Bell seemed to understand that he had to repair his image in the public eye. He was wise enough to see that something more than words would be required to quiet the fears aroused by his background. Part of Bell’s immediate response was to select for senior posts in the Justice Department two black men and one white woman, a move many of his critics met with praise. His years as attorney general included any number of racially charged disputes: cases about school busing for integration, the decision whether to file charges in the police killing of a young Hispanic man, and a very public argument over which position the administration should take in the Supreme Court’s first encounter with affirmative action in college admissions. Through it all, he developed a reputation for moderation. If his positions were not always my positions, neither were they dangerously radical. And Bell took another step, one that all too few recent attorneys general have attempted. Many observers were worried because he and Carter were so close. They had grown up together in Sumter County, Georgia; the press called them “cronies.” Bell responded by building “a giant barrier” to preserve the independence of the Justice Department from White House meddling. He even internalized most judicial selection, keeping the choices away from the president’s political operatives. All of these steps helped to quiet the fears of those who looked at Bell’s early career and worried. Probably the worries never really went away. And certainly he did not always live up to his own standards. But it was obvious to everyone that he was trying, and that simple fact made a difference. If Bell is not on the list of the truly great attorneys general, neither does he land on the list of failures. He did reasonably well, then slipped into history. There are lessons aplenty in this history, both for Sessions and for his critics. For the critics, perhaps it is best to accept that he will be a conservative, but on the issue of the now-ancient racial comments, give him, warily, a chance to prove himself. For Sessions himself, the lessons require action more concrete. He should do what Bell did, both by reaching outside the expected circle to find aides who, if not precisely of the left, at least show his critics that he is willing to meet them halfway. (And, yes, racial diversity will help.) Much more important is that he try, as Bell tried, to prove that he isn’t simply there as the president’s crony. This will require that he rebuild the wall, to let the White House know not to call anyone in the building but him -- and then to inform whoever is on the line that he is leaving the issue, whatever it may be, to his assistants, and would not insult them by passing on the administration’s views. Donald Trump isn’t Jimmy Carter, and people are tired of being told to hope for the best. But that doesn’t change my recommendation about what Sessions should do. Would taking these steps make him a perfect attorney general? Of course not. But that sets the bar too high. His job will be to do his job -- and to do it in ways that assure most of his fellow citizens that he is both independent of the White House and no longer the man who once made bad jokes about the Klan. The vote was 75-21. Those voting “nay” constituted an unusual coalition, running from the very liberal (for instance, George McGovern, Charles Percy and John Culver) to the very conservative (for instance, Strom Thurmond, Barry Goldwater and Jesse Helms). The wall, alas, was more permeable than it should have been. In 1978, Bell was criticized, and properly so, for firing David W. Marston, a Republican then serving as U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, who was investigating at least two Democratic members of the House of Representatives. At least one of those under investigation had apparently called President Carter to complain, and Carter had called Bell. Bell insisted that he had asked Marston to remain at his post until the administration found a replacement who was his equal “in ability character and integrity,” but Marston refused to do so.

It's hard to definitively interpret the emotion without more context, but we can safely say that she is not interacting directly with the older woman based on the description. The older woman is drinking. This connotes she is busy with her own activity, not necessarily engaging with the younger woman. Again, without further context, it's hard to infer more from her action. Next, the hypothesis states that the two women are hugging. Hugging is a physical action undertaken usually to provide comfort, express affection, or celebrate. This experience often involves at least some level of closeness and contact between the individuals.  As we compare the premise and the hypothesis, it is clear that the actions described do not overlap or implicitly suggest the conditions indicated by the hypothesis are happening. A woman looking down and another woman drinking does not imply or necessitate that they are hugging.  Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, due to a lack of corroborating information connecting the scenario described in the premise with the situation proposed in the hypothesis. The relevant interpersonal action detailed in the hypothesis (hugging) is not present or implied in the premise. Hence, the correct answer is, \\"No, we cannot conclude that the two women are hugging based on the premise provided.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This honor pays tribute to the distinguished history and commendable service of the Welsh regiment, both at home and abroad. As the sun shone brightly on the principled soldiers, the residents of the Welsh island reveled in an unforgettable day filled with pride, emotion, and fervent celebrations. The Royal Welsh, an esteemed infantry regiment of the British Army, is renowned for its long and distinguished history that dates back centuries. Over time, the soldiers have exhibited exceptional valor and unwavering dedication to their service, protecting the freedom and democracy of the British people, including the inhabitants of Holyhead and Anglesey. Comprising fearless warriors who serve with honor and dignity, the regiment is a living symbol of resilience, fortitude, and the indomitable Welsh spirit. The parade through Holyhead was a stunning spectacle, as soldiers dressed in their resplendent ceremonial attire proudly marched through the town's streets. With precision and harmony, they proceeded along the town's thoroughfares, accompanied by the stirring sound of their band. Spectators, both local and visiting, lined the streets to honor their heroes, waving flags and cheering loudly with each step of the regiment's soldiers. This momentous occasion not only saw the soldiers granted the Freedom of Anglesey but also praised and lauded the unwavering efforts of their families—mothers, fathers, children, and spouses who have stood by the troops throughout their illustrious history. Joined by local dignitaries, veterans, and citizens of all ages, the parade served as a heartening reminder of the unity and camaraderie fostered by the Welsh communities. The Freedom of Anglesey is a distinguished privilege rooted in ancient tradition, a symbol of trust and respect that has been bestowed on select groups over the centuries. The ceremony, held at the town hall, saw solemn oaths of allegiance sworn by proud representatives of the Royal Welsh to the Crown and the island of Anglesey. As a testament to the region's admiration and support for the military, the soldiers were granted the freedom to march through the streets and the opportunity to form everlasting bonds with the Anglesey community. Moreover, the celebrations highlighted the integral role of The Royal Welsh in preserving and promoting the distinctive Welsh culture and heritage. Adorned with their traditional cap badges, hackles, and leeks, the soldiers showcased the rich history of Wales weaving it into the very fabric of the regiment's identity. The Royal Welsh regiment continues to serve as vital custodians of their nation's proud legacy, passionately guarding and shepherding its unique traditions and history. The Royal Welsh's parade in Holyhead will forever serve as a testament to the enduring bond between the prestigious regiment and the people of Anglesey. As the soldiers march ahead, they carry forth an unwavering commitment to persevere in their duties and a sense of pride that swells in the hearts of their fellow citizens. The Freedom of Anglesey, a cherished tribute to the Royal Welsh's dedication and courage, symbolizes their boundless resolve and fortitude, qualities they will embody as they continue to defend the freedom and democracy of their beloved homeland. In conclusion, the day the Royal Welsh marched through Holyhead and received the Freedom of Anglesey will be etched in the memories of those who bore witness to this glorious event. It was a day that exhibited the profundity of pride, a feeling replete with the conviction that the Welsh spirit, bolstered by the courageous regiment, will continue to triumph over adversity, reflecting the nation's enduring strength, resilience, and unity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Their reactions run the gamut from incredulousness and sadness to anger, and are directed at Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who is sitting calmly behind a desk. He works for CTC, Career Transition Counseling. In a voice-over, Ryan introduces himself: \\"I work for another company that lends me out to pussies like Steve's boss, who don't have the balls to sack their own employees.\\" There's a quick montage of retaliatory actions a disgruntled fired employee might engage in (pouring bleach in the coffee, sniper shooting), and we see Ryan offer a pat, sincere consolation to Steve, a fired employee.In a hotel room, experienced traveler Ryan expertly packs his suitcase.

The victors ruled on Mt. Olympus and imprisoned the vanquished -- the Titans -- beneath Mt. Tartarus on Earth. Also lost during the battle is the Bow of Epirus, a mighty weapon that can shoot invincible energy arrows.Centuries later, King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) mounts a campaign to recover the Bow of Epirus and free the Titans. Bitter over the deaths of his wife and children due to disease, he is resolved to destroy the gods who refused his prayers to spare his family. He overtakes the Sybelline Monastery, imprisoning the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and her attendants, then lays waste to villages in the area. In one village works the stone mason Theseus (Henry Cavil). Theseus has been trained in the military arts by a mysterious Old Man (John Hurt) who encourages him to be a protector of all humanity; Theseus, whose devout mother was raped and thus considered an outcast, refuses. When the goddess Athena (Isabel Lucas) visits the Old Man, he is revealed to be Zeus (Luke Evans) in human disguise.When Hyperion's forces destroy Theseus's village, he kills Theseus's mother in front of him and imprisons Theseus, where Phaedra and her attendants are also kept. Phaedra inadvertently touches Theseus and has a vision of him as either the savior of humanity or the ally of Hyperion in the destruction of the world. That night, she and her attendants seduce and kill the guards; Phaedra escapes with Theseus and two other slaves, Stavros (Steven Dorff) and Daerios (Alan Van Spring).Although Zeus has forbidden the gods to intervene unless the Titans are freed, Athena, Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) and Ares (Daniel Sharman) determine to protect Theseus as best they can. Phaedra tells Theseus he must return to his village and properly bury his mother. There, Theseus discovers the Bow of Epirus.

The Department of Homeland Security ranked dead last again among federal agencies for overall employee satisfaction and commitment, with its score dropping to a historic low in the annual Best Places to Work in the Federal Government rankings. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson promised to make worker morale a top priority before his Senate confirmation last year. Let’s examine what he has done since taking office. Johnson and Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas created an employee steering committee focused on fairness in hiring and promotions, and they restarted a program that honors outstanding workers. Johnson handed out distinguished-service awards to more than 300 workers at a ceremony in October, drawing cheerful whoops from the crowd when he asked how their morale was doing. The agency said in a statement Tuesday that it has also invested more in training and professional development, in addition to building a communications platform that would “capture employees’ ideas effectively.” In this year’s Best Places rankings, Homeland Security finished last among large federal agencies for the third consecutive year as employee satisfaction and commitment dropped three points to 44 percent. The steepest decline occurred in the area of senior leadership. DHS said it is reviewing its programs for selecting and training executives to find out whether changes are needed. Since Johnson took office, the agency has also filled several key leadership vacancies, something management experts have long urged the agency to do. A recent exodus of DHS employees has exacerbated the agency’s leadership problems, with workers leaving the agency at nearly twice the rate of the federal government overall during the past four years, according to a Washington Post review of federal data. DHS’s efforts didn’t improve the agency’s score in this year’s Best Places rankings, but many of the initiatives are less than a year old at this point. Next year’s results may serve as a better measurement of Johnson’s effectiveness. Josh Hicks covers the federal government and anchors the Federal Eye blog. He reported for newspapers in the Detroit and Seattle suburbs before joining the Post as a contributor to Glenn Kessler’s Fact Checker blog in 2011. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Department of Homeland Security has ranked last among federal agencies for employee satisfaction and commitment, leading to the creation of an employee steering committee, increased investment in training and professional development, and a new communications platform to tackle the issue of low morale.

Background: Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded the Beach Boys. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson is known for his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, and he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. The Beach Boys were formed by Brian, his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Context: Recording sessions for the band's first album took place in Capitol's basement studios in the famous tower building in August 1962, but early on Brian lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boy tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Brian's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights, and in return the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Brian fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production - though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit.  In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Hollywood's United Western Recorders on Sunset Boulevard. It was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use double tracking on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound. The Surfin' U.S.A. album was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.  Brian was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the Surfer Girl album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Brian decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, Little Deuce Coupe, which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the Surfer Girl LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Brian was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio.  For much of the decade, Brian attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists. On July 20, 1963, \\"Surf City\\", which he co-wrote with Jan Berry of Jan and Dean, was his first composition to reach the top of the US charts. The resulting success pleased Brian, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean. Brian's other non-Beach Boy work in this period included tracks by the Castells, Donna Loren, Sharon Marie, the Timers, and the Survivors. The most notable group to which Wilson would attach himself in this era would be the Honeys, which Wilson intended as the female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and as an attempt to compete with Phil Spector-led girl groups such as the Crystals and the Ronettes. He continued juggling between recording with the Beach Boys and producing records for other artists, but with less success at the latter--except for Jan and Dean. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article that demonstrate Brian Wilson's growth as a musician, his contributions to the music industry, and the impact of his personal circumstances on his work. 1. Innovativeness in music production: Brian Wilson's insistence on using different recording studios and techniques showcased his forward-thinking approach. He recognized that Capitol's basement studios, which were designed for larger orchestras, were not suitable for their rock band, leading to the decision to use United Western Recorders on Sunset Boulevard. This proved beneficial, as the band found great success while recording in Hollywood. 2. Early adoption of double-tracking: Wilson made a significant decision to use double tracking on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound. This technique contributed to the Beach Boys' distinct and influential sound. 3. Transition from surfing to car-oriented tunes: Though the Beach Boys initially found fame with their surfing songs, Wilson felt these tunes were limiting and decided to shift focus towards car-oriented music. This decision led to the creation of popular albums like Little Deuce Coupe, demonstrating Wilson's ability to adapt to changing music trends. 4. Challenges in working with other artists: Despite his successes with the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson faced challenges as a producer for other artists. His collaboration with Jan Berry on \\"Surf City\\" enraged Murry Wilson and Capitol Records, ultimately leading to the end of their partnership. Despite this, Wilson continued working with various artists throughout the 1960s, striving to recreate the success he experienced with the Beach Boys. 5. Impact of mental health and personal life on his work: Brian Wilson's lifelong struggles with mental health have been well-documented, and this article highlights the effect of his personal life on his career. The departure of guitarist David Marks forced Wilson to return to touring with the Beach Boys, reducing his availability in the recording studio. Additionally, conflicts with his father and record label affected his collaborations with other artists. Overall, this article sheds light on Brian Wilson's contributions to the music industry as an innovative composer and producer, as well as the personal challenges he faced throughout his career, which shaped the trajectory of both his own life and the Beach Boys' legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the end they realize that the person they killed is not the king and a girl already released is the real king. [D-Man2010] Answer:","output":"Upon their arrival at the local grocery store, the group of men who were preparing weapons for a fire fight found a group of people. The men from the car took over the store and appeared to be searching for someone in particular. One notable member of their group was scanning individuals by looking into their eyes.  However, their operation wasn't unopposed. A cop managed to evade the raiders, succeed in shooting one of them - referred to as Spooky, who was the one scanning everyone - and call for backup, though he was eventually shot as well. The dead bodies, including that of the cop, were then moved back to the store's freezers where one of the raiders fired bullets into them. When the police finally arrived, the hostages who had been cleared were released, whereas the uncleared ones were cornered in the back and forced to drink milk. It was revealed at this point that the raiders were actually a group of scientists, tracking an unknown contagion to the town and more specifically, to the supermarket.  Since the individual nicknamed Spooky was dead, an alternate method had to be used to find out who was infected. The group started with the supermarket's boss, asking him questions as a distraction technique to cut one of his fingers. While this was happening, the boss attempted to escape and disclosed that he had stolen money from the store.  Meanwhile, the remaining hostages initiated a plan to escape. One of them went into the freezer to retrieve a gun, but was killed by an unidentified person who was later revealed in the film to be an alien king.

The statement \\"take away the controversy, and it's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera\\" suggests that, without the element of controversy, the movie would be as uninteresting or low-quality as a stereotypical Mexican soap opera, which are often criticized for their melodramatic storylines and over-the-top acting. By comparing the movie to a Mexican soap opera, the reviewer seems to imply that the film's appeal primarily lies in its controversial aspects. Once those elements are stripped away, the quality of the film becomes comparable to an entertainment piece that is not highly regarded, which alludes to a negative evaluation of the movie. The reviewer might be suggesting that, beyond the attention-grabbing controversial elements, the movie's plot, storytelling, or other aspects did not possess enough merit to make it a genuinely enjoyable or commendable cinematic experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jurre Hermans, the 11-year-old Dutch boy who entered the Â£250,000 (400,000) Wolfson Economics Prize with a pizza-based plan for saving the eurozone, did so because he had an idea and the winnings sounded \\"very attractive,\\" he told CNN. Jurre received a â‚¬100 (131) gift voucher and special mention when the prize shortlist was announced Tuesday for his detailed entry -- including a picture, below -- showing how debt can be exchanged for slices of pizza. Exiting the euro: As easy as pizza? The competition was launched in October by Simon Wolfson, the man behind British retail chain Next, to try and find ways to deal with a collapse of the euro -- the currency tying together 17 European countries. The euro has been under intense pressure since Greece was forced to take a bail-out from its eurozone peers and the International Monetary Fund almost two years ago. Through his father Julius, Jurre told CNN he had an idea to solve the euro crisis and also thought the prize money sounded \\"attractive.\\" Jurre, the youngest entrant to the prize, proposed Greece should leave the euro, with the Greek people slotting their funds into a bank \\"exchange machine\\" and getting drachma -- the Greek currency before the country joined the euro in 2001 -- back. As Jurre explains in his application, the bank then gives the euros to the Greek government and \\"all these euros together form a pancake or a pizza. Now the Greek government can start to pay back all their debts, everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza.\\" Jurre noted the \\"clever part\\" of his idea was that the Greek people would not want to change their euros for drachma, because they know the currency would depreciate. However, if they hide their euros, Jurre said they should be slapped with severe financial penalties. Wolfson: Why Europe needs to think about a euro collapse.

He had a plan to help save the eurozone using a pizza-based idea. He thought the prize money of £250,000 (400,000) sounded very attractive. Jurre suggests that Greece should leave the euro currency. Their money would then be exchanged from euros to drachma, which was the Greek currency before the euro. The bank would collect all the euros, put them together like a pizza, and then the Greek government can use it to pay back their debts. Jurre got a special mention for his idea and received a gift voucher. He hopes his idea helps but plans to work with animals when he grows up, not become an economist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She invites him to her apartment for tea. A few months later, they are married.Irena is a strange and lonely woman with no friends. She has a fascination with panthers, but animals don't seem to like her very much. When Oliver brings her a Siamese kitten as a gift, for example, the cat hisses at Irena, so they return to the pet store and exchange it for a bird.

Several weeks later, the bird dies in fear when Irena reaches for it in its cage.Irena is haunted by a tale from her country that tells how the people of her village were witches, devil worshippers, and, under strong emotions like jealousy or anger, could change into panthers.

When Irena returns home after the first session, she finds Oliver and Alice seated on the couch, talking about her. Irena gets angry when Oliver reveals that he has told Alice about her problem.About a week later, Oliver runs into Dr Judd and learns that Irena has stopped seeing him.

Currently, there is no evidence showing that these work and none of these products are approved by the government. Many tanning salons sell these products. Resist the sales pitch and, if you have to try the products, pick up cheap versions from any general store. After sweating so much, you’ll feel gross, but wait an hour before jumping in the shower. While an immediate shower won’t ruin your session, it will wash off any products you applied and slow the spread of the tan. Hot water does this too, so keep the temperature low. Rub a moisturizer into your skin at least once a day every day. This will keep your skin smooth and elastic, so your tan won’t fade as fast as it normally would.

Q:People voted for the outsider because they hoped it would bring what? - welcome change - hate each other - talk to each other - make choice - an applebees  The best answer is A:","output":"People voted for the outsider because they hoped it would bring welcome change. This answer encompasses different essential aspects that voters often look for in a political figure who is relatively new to the political arena or who has not been an insider for a long time. These essential aspects can include breaking the status quo, having fresh perspectives, and bridging the gaps between different groups.  A welcome change implies that voters are seeking a shift from the current state of affairs. They may be unhappy with the way that things are being handled by the government or do not see progress being made. The outsider candidate often represents the idea of disrupting the established way of doing things, leading to potential policy changes and improvements to many aspects of society. In voting for an outsider, individuals may also look for someone who has not been influenced by the prevalent political culture. It can be argued that long-time politicians might be more susceptible to lobbying, corruption, or simply adhering to their party's beliefs rather than those of their constituents. The outsider candidate represents a chance to inject new ideas and solutions into various political issues, thereby reinvigorating the political system. Moreover, outsider candidates may have a unique ability to bring together people from different walks of life. Due to their less-established political ties, they could potentially be more open to working with other parties to accomplish shared goals. In this way, people who vote for the outsider may hope to see an increase in cooperation and a decrease in the polarization that can often plague nations. However, it is important to note that there could also be concerns surrounding an outsider candidate. These concerns may stem from the candidate's lack of experience, a perceived inability to work with long-standing political figures, or even concerns about overall competence. Despite these potential issues, many individuals continue to vote for outsider candidates in the hope that their fresh perspectives and ability to challenge the status quo will outweigh the risks. In conclusion, people often vote for the outsider because they hope for a welcome change in the political landscape. Through their fresh perspectives, potential to ignite cooperation, and distance from established politics, outsider candidates can represent a departure from the norms that have kept societies in stagnation. While there may be concerns about their abilities to navigate the political system, many voters continue to place their faith in the possibility of positive change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identify the main components of the phrase. In this case, we have: 1. Own - a possessive pronoun, indicating that something belongs to the speaker or subject. 2. Tortured - an adjective, which describes something as having endured significant pain or suffering. 3. Psyche - a noun referring to the human mind or soul. Step 2: Analyze the connotations of each component. 1. Own - neutral in connotation; mainly serves to indicate possession. 2. Tortured - has a negative connotation, as it implies suffering and distress. 3. Psyche - neutral in connotation; simply refers to an aspect of a person's inner self.

News article: Saturday, August 22, 2009 New York Yankees Boston, MA (Sports Network) - Junichi Tazawa got the win in his first start against the Yankees and Kevin Youkilis hit a pair of homers while tying a career-high with six RBI, as the Red Sox crushed New York, 14-1, in the middle test of a three-game set from Fenway Park. With the win, the BoSox, who snapped a five-game slide against their bitter division rivals, closed to within 6 1/2 games of New York for the lead in the AL East. Tazawa (2-2), whose introduction to the majors came on August 7 when he allowed a game-winning two-run home run to Alex Rodriguez in the 15th inning of a contest at Yankee Stadium, lasted six scoreless frames and was touched for just eight hits with two strikeouts and as many walks. \\"There were some pitches I couldn't locate well but when I needed to pitch, I could throw the ball pretty well,\\" said Tazawa. David Ortiz homered, knocked in three runs and scored twice for the Red Sox, who have won four of five. Alex Gonzalez added a solo homer, while Victor Martinez and Casey Kotchman also drove in a run apiece in the triumph, which saw the Sox pound out 15 hits. Nick Swisher went 3-for-5 with a solo homer for the Yankees, who saw their three-game winning streak halted. Robinson Cano also had three hits in the setback. A.J. Burnett (10-7) took the loss after giving up nine runs on as many hits in five innings of work. The righty also fanned six and walked two, however, the setback extended Burnett's current winless streak to five consecutive starts, in which he's registered three losses and a pair of no decisions. \\"It's not what we expected but let's not forget what he did two weeks ago against the Red Sox,\\" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. \\"The bottom line is winning games and he's been winning games and pitching great for us and today he didn't. I think the way he's been pitching, anytime he has a bad day, you're a little shocked because he's been throwing the ball so well for us.\\" The Red Sox assumed control of the contest with seven runs over the first two frames. In the first, consecutive one-out singles from Dustin Pedroia and Martinez made it first and third before Youkilis fouled out. Ortiz followed with a two- run double off the Green Monster and Jason Bay's RBI single made it 3-0. A solo homer from Gonzalez and Youkilis' three-run blast over the Monster in the second stanza gave the home team a 7-0 advantage. Ortiz had a two-out solo homer to left in the fifth, and Bay followed with a double and scored on J.D. Drew's ground-rule double into the bullpen in right to make it a nine-run game. Pedroia had a two-out double in the sixth and scored as Martinez followed with a single to center field. \\"Youk\\" kept it going with another homer over The Monster, which made it 12-0. Daniel Bard took over for the Sox in the seventh and gave up a one-out homer to Swisher. However, Kotchman and Youkilis had an RBI double each off David Robertson in the eighth to account for the final margin.

One child has died and another four fell seriously ill after drinking dangerous raw milk sold in health stores as 'cosmetic milk' for bathing in. Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food. A three-year-old, from Mornington Peninsula - south-east of Melbourne, allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk, the Herald Sun reports. The product is advertised on the family-run company's website as 'amazing fresh 'raw bath milk'… dropped off to the farm store every Thursday for pick up'. Mountain View Farm owner Vicki Jones said the company always advised people not to drink the product. 'What people do with milk when they take it home, I can't tell them what to do,' she said. Scroll down for video. A three-year-old allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk. Ms Jones said the company labelled their milk with non-consumption warnings in accordance with health department regulations, but was happy to make any recommended changes. 'We've told them we're happy to add extra labelling and warnings to the milk,' she said. 'We're happy to comply with whatever they request.' Meanwhile, four children from Melbourne, aged one to four, have been struck down with serious illnesses such as gastroenteritis after drinking different brands of raw milk. The raw milk is often sold in fridges near to the pasteurised drinking milk and it's packaging looks similar to that of regular milk. There has been a resurgence in people wanting to drink raw milk as part of a belief that raw and unprocessed food is healthier. They claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms. Dr Rosemary Lester (left) from Victoria's Department of Health has issued a health warning. The raw milk is often sold near pasteurised milk (right) Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester says raw milk, which is marketed as bath milk, can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea if consumed. 'Only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' Dr Lester said. She said unpasteurised milk could make anyone sick but risks were greatest for young children and elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people. 'Since the 1940s, it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said. 'Milk is heated for a very short period of time, effectively destroying any disease-causing bacteria which may be present in raw milk.' Dr Lester has referred the matter to Consumer Affairs Victoria and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), saying bath milk packaging was very similar to drinking milk and they could be easily confused. Consumer Affairs Victoria director Dr Claire Noone says the watchdog will review the marketing of raw milk and work with the ACCC to establish whether there had been a breach of consumer law. 'In Victoria it is illegal to package, deliver or provide raw milk for human consumption. However, it still may be labelled and sold for cosmetic use,' she said in a statement on Thursday. An ACCC spokesperson said the commission would consider the adequacy of labelling but urged consumers to follow safety instructions on product packaging. The child's death will appear in front of the State Coroner. Dr Rosemary Lester says on the Department's website: 'The Department has been notified of a number of illnesses including three cases of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) and two cases of cryptosporidiosis. All cases have consumed unpasteurised (raw) milk which is sold as 'bath' or 'cosmetic' milk in Victoria.' She explained: 'Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection that commonly presents are gastroenteritis with watery diarrhoea. 'HUS is a rare condition which can be caused by shiga toxin and verotoxin producing E.coli that affects the kidneys and the bloodstream. Children are most susceptible to contracting HUS, which begins with abdominal pains and bloody diarrhoea which can last for about a week. 'Serious cases of HUS can lead to renal failure and death. Only small numbers of these pathogens are needed to cause illness.' Because the products are classed as cosmetic and are marked 'not for human consumption' the department has no power to recall them. Dr Lester said: 'In Australia, the sale of unpasteurised (raw) cow's milk for human consumption is illegal. In Victoria, it is also illegal to package, deliver or provide unpasteurised (raw) milk for human consumption. Unpasteurised milk is sometimes labelled and sold for cosmetic use only. 'Packaging of unpasteurised milk is often very similar to other milk products. 'Unpasteurised milk should not be consumed.'

Rotate the pencil in your and and repeat until pencil point is formed.. 2). Hold the pencil in one hand and angle the pencil to the side walk surface. Make the angle about thirty degrees.  Apply mineral oil to the side walk, then, move the pencil back and forth until the wood is worn away a little.  Rotate the pencil in your and and repeat until pencil point is formed..","output":"Between the two options provided, Option 1 is the better solution for sharpening a pencil on a rough concrete surface. This option involves holding the pencil at an approximately thirty-degree angle and moving it back and forth on the rough surface to wear away the wood. Rotating the pencil in your hand at regular intervals ensures an even grind and ultimately forms a sharpened pencil point. There are several reasons why Option 1 is a better solution than Option 2: 1. Simplicity: Option 1 is a simpler method of sharpening a pencil on a rough concrete surface as it requires no additional materials or substances like mineral oil in Option 2. The straightforward action of rubbing the pencil against the concrete surface will wear away the wood, revealing the graphite core and creating a point. 2. Availability of materials: In Option 1, you only need a pencil and concrete surface to execute the process, whereas, in Option 2, you also need mineral oil. It might not always be possible to find mineral oil readily available in various situations, making Option 1 more practical in most cases. 3. Safety concerns: Applying mineral oil to a concrete surface, as suggested in Option 2, could create a slippery and dangerous situation for anyone walking on or near the oiled area. It would also leave an oily residue on the sidewalk, which could be harmful to the environment. 4. Mess: Option 2 would create a mess due to the application of oil on the sidewalk, making it a less desirable choice. Option 1, on the other hand, will only produce a small amount of wood shavings that can be easily swept away or blown off the surface by wind. 5. Effectiveness: Option 1 would be just as effective, if not more effective, than Option 2. Rubbing the pencil against the rough surface of concrete without any lubrication will effectively wear away the wood and create a sharp point. The added mineral oil in Option 2 may actually hinder the sharpening process as it could potentially reduce the friction between the pencil and the concrete surface, thereby decreasing its effectiveness. In conclusion, Option 1 is a superior choice for sharpening a pencil on a rough concrete surface because it is simpler, relies on readily available materials, avoids potential safety hazards, generates less mess, and remains effective for the task at hand."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 06:22 EST, 13 January 2012. Nearly half of Mormons say church members face significant discrimination in the United States, and a third believe voters are not ready to elect Mitt Romney, or any other member of their church, president. A survey of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints published by the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion & Public Life comes as the former Massachusetts governor fights to keep his GOP front-runner status. The campaign moves next to the January 21 primary in South Carolina, where evangelical voters are key. Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, who is Mormon, is also seeking the Republican nomination. Front-runner: Mitt Romney's campaign has been emphasising values that Mormons and conservative Christians share. LDS church leaders have long. complained that critics take obscure or outdated Mormon teachings and. describe them as core doctrine. The church cast aside the teaching of. polygamy in 1890, and in 1978, abolished the barrier that kept those of. African descent from full participation in the church. In the latest Pew. survey, only two per cent of Mormons said polygamy is morally. acceptable. The Pew study found that almost half of Mormons in the U.S. consider themselves more discriminated against than African Americans. Despite the prejudice Mormons feel, a. majority expressed optimism about their future. The question of religion: Republican presidential candidate Governor Jon Huntsman is another Mormon seeking the nomination. More than 60 per cent. believe Americans are moving toward acceptance of Mormonism but 32 per. cent don't believe the U.S. is ready to accept a Latter-day Saint as. president. An overwhelming majority of Mormon voters hold favourable. views of Romney, the poll found. In the 2012 race, Romney has not. directly addressed theological differences between his faith and. historic Christianity, as he did in his first bid for the nomination,. with a 2007 faith-and-values speech in Texas, Instead, his campaign has. been emphasizing values that Mormons and conservative Christians share. About 77 per cent of Mormons in the. survey identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, and most hold. much stronger conservative views than the general public. Three-quarters. support a smaller government that provides fewer services. The same. percentage say having an abortion is morally wrong. Two-thirds believe. homosexuality should be discouraged. Rank-and-file Mormons reflect the. strong emphasis throughout the LDS church on family. Asked their life. priorities, a large majority of respondents listed being a good parent. and having a successful marriage. Worship: Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah, a popular tourist destination owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Latter-day Saints also have a high. level of religious observance that surpasses even the most devout. American Christians. Three-quarters of Mormons said they attended. religious services weekly or more, compared to 64 per cent of white. evangelicals and 42 per cent of white Catholics. Two-thirds of Mormons. say they pray several times a day, compared to half of evangelicals and. about one-third of Catholics. The poll of 1,019 Mormons was. conducted October 25 through November 16 of last year and has a margin. of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points:. How much do Americans know about Mormonism  Great deal/Some 37%Not too much/nothing 62%Don't know 1%A lot of discrimination against Mormons?Yes 46%No 51%Don't know 3%Others see Mormonism as mainstream?Yes 28%No 68%Other/Don't know 5%Acceptance of Mormonism is...Rising 63%Falling 5%Not changing 29%Don't know 3%U.S. ready for a Mormon president?Yes 56%No 32%Depends/Don't know 12%Source: Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion & Public Life. Since 1994, a group of evangelical. and Mormon scholars who have been meeting to discuss theology, focusing. on their shared beliefs. All but two percent of Mormons in the Pew. survey said they believe that Jesus was resurrected. Nearly all believe. the Bible is the word of God and describe themselves Christian or. 'Christ-centred'. However, Mormons just as strongly hold beliefs that traditional Christians consider heretical. The study showed that Mormons and. white evangelicals share an intense commitment to family life, prayer,. the Bible and conservative politics, including support for the. Republican Party and smaller government, but the two groups strongly. hold divergent religious beliefs. Conservative Christians, including. Protestants and Roman Catholics, generally do not consider Mormons to be. Christian, but it is unclear what role those objections will play in. South Carolina vote and beyond. Surveys have found that Republicans with. the strongest objections to Mormonism also are among the fiercest. opponents to President Barack Obama, and would back a Mormon in the. general election. All but six per cent of Mormons. believe that God the Father and Jesus Christ are separate, physical. beings, a rejection of the doctrine of the Trinity, in which God, the. Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit coexist and share one substance. Joseph Smith became Mormonism's. founding prophet after he said he experienced visions during the late. 1820s. He said he was told not to join any church because they all held. wrong beliefs. An angel, he said, then directed him to gold plates that. had been buried in the ground in upstate New York, which Smith then. translated as the Book of Mormon. Nearly all Mormons in the survey said. they believe the Book of Mormon was written by ancient prophets and that. the president of the LDS church is a prophet of God. The Pew Forum estimates that Mormons. comprise less than two per cent of the U.S. population, are overwhelming. white and in the West. Nearly six in ten Mormons said that most or all. of their close friends are also Mormon. The LDS church has been running a. multimillion-dollar advertising campaign featuring the personal stories. of Mormons hoping to educate the public. The poll of 1,019 Mormons was. conducted October 25 through November 16 of last year and has a margin. of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Highlights:","output":"1.

The Prime Minister has come under fire from stay-at-home mothers after excluding them from new childcare plans. He was also criticised for stopping child benefit for families living off a single salary at a lower income level than those with two wage earners. But he denied ministers were trying to force mothers back to work. Mr Cameron also signalled that he was preparing to dilute controversial plans to increase the number of children a childminder can look after, following opposition from his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg. The Prime Minister said he did not agree with Business Secretary Vince Cable that there was ‘prejudice’ against stay-at-home mothers. He added: ‘I support the choices mums make. If they want to work we should support that, and if they want to stay at home we should support that. The idea is not to dictate to people what they should do, but to support the choices they make. ‘There are lots of things we do that help stay-at-home mums. The support we’re giving for nursery education is a good example.’ His words will encourage Tory MPs and ministers who are lobbying him to fulfil his promise to create a marriage tax break. Speculation is mounting that George Osborne may bring in a modest tax break in his autumn statement. But some Tories believe it will come too late to take effect before the next election in 2015. The Prime Minister also suggested he was willing to compromise over the Coalition’s childcare plans after Mr Clegg withdrew his support at the last moment. Ministers were planning to relax the rules on the number of children childminders and nursery staff can care for. But in a late change of heart this month, Mr Clegg said he had serious concerns about the plans, which would allow nursery staff to look after six two-year-olds. Nick Clegg withdrew his support for the Coalition's childcare plans at the last moment following a call in to his LBC Radio by campaigner Laura Perrins. Laura Perrins told Clegg many families felt discriminated against by a £1,200 tax break. This enraged Education Secretary Michael. Gove, who accused Mr Clegg of blocking the plans to bolster his. position as Lib Dem leader. Mr Clegg’s U-turn followed an embarrassing phone-in on his LBC radio show in March, when he was harangued by barrister and mother-of-two Laura Perrins. The 32-year-old, who gave up her legal career to look after her children, told him many traditional families felt discriminated against by the announcement that working parents only would receive a tax break of up to £1,200 per year to cover soaring childcare costs. Mrs Perrins, from the group Mothers At Home Matter, said ministers viewed her choice as ‘worthless’. Yesterday, Mr Cameron said it was pointless getting frustrated with Mr Clegg’s change of tack, adding: ‘Trying to get quality affordable childcare is a priority for the Government. The proposals we put forward had a lot of merit. ‘Clearly there now needs to be a discussion in the Coalition about how best to go forward. ‘There’s no point getting too frustrated. We’ll find a way forward that I hope will be good for people who want affordable childcare.’ From September, the ratio for under-ones had been due to rise from three per adult to four. Each adult would also be able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four. The ratio for three-year-olds would remain unchanged. Tory sources claim this would cut nursery costs by around £1,300 a year without compromising quality. But the plans were criticised by childminders and mothers.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: After a week off to parts unknown, John Oliver is back and he brought the big guns on the latest edition of his addictive HBO series Last Week Tonight. The big segment concerned professional sports stadiums—mainly, how sports franchises are ripping off the public by financing their souped-up arenas with billions of dollars in taxpayer money even though the franchises themselves are profitable, they’re owned by billionaires, and they don’t boost the economy of their host city.      But prior to that 19-minute investigation, Oliver aired his “And Now This” segment, and this week’s was titled, “Whoopi Goldberg Defends Ten Surprising Things.”      The montage of clips was no doubt pegged to Goldberg’s continued defense of accused serial rapist Bill Cosby. Goldberg has arguably been Cosby’s most vocal supporter not named Camille throughout this horrifying ordeal in which over 40 women over the years 1965-2008 have accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting them. Last week, the Associated Press published unsealed Cosby testimony from a 2005 civil suit wherein the comedian admitted to the following: drugging a 19-year-old woman for the purpose of sex; obtaining seven prescriptions for Quaaludes to administer to women for the purpose of sex; asking his agent at William Morris to pay off a woman “no questions asked”; and offering to pay for one of his rape accusers’ educations when she and her mother asked him for an apology.      Despite this eye-opening reveal, Goldberg lowered her head and soldiered on in her defense of Cosby, saying she “doesn’t like snap judgments,” “he has not been proven a rapist,” and cracking dismissive jokes about how “the ‘80s weren’t fun for everybody, clearly.”      So Oliver, as is his wont, thoroughly embarrassed Goldberg with a supercut of things she’s defended—mostly while serving as co-host of daytime talk show The View—including Roman Polanski (“I don’t believe it was rape-rape”); Ray Rice (“If you hit somebody, you cannot be sure you are not going to get hit back”); CIA torture (“There are other countries that have done it, and it’s reaped quite the benefits for them”); the list goes on.Watch it here: ||||| Whoopi Goldberg in April 2015. (Photo: Andy Kropa/Invision/AP)      Bill Cosby's last prominent public supporter, Whoopi Goldberg, dramatically changed her mind on Tuesday.      After taking intense heat for defending him as \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" of allegations he raped and drugged dozens of women over decades, Goldberg concluded on The View that there is no legal way to prove his guilt.      Therefore, she said, he can only be tried in the court of public opinion, as is happening at the moment.      \\"And I gotta say all the information out there kind of points to guilt,\\" she said. \\"I can't say anymore, 'innocent until proven guilty' because there's no way to prove it.      \\"It looks bad, Bill,\\" she said, addressing Cosby.      The Wrap had the video.      Goldberg, who says she's gotten death threats for her stance up to now on Cosby, brought on ABC legal analyst Dan Abrams to discuss Cosby, interviewing him about how the criminal justice system handles rape allegations and state statutes of limitation.      “I’ve got to say, all of the information that’s out there kind of points to guilt.” -@WhoopiGoldberg on #BillCosbypic.twitter.com/X1cWNfEJHz — The View (@TheView) July 14, 2015      Someone is innocent until proven guilty in the U.S. justice system, but this only applies when someone is arrested, charged and is tried, Abrams said.      That hasn't happened with Cosby and probably won't because the allegations against him are so old they fall outside the statutes of limitation. If the public objects, the public has to pressure state legislatures to change the law, he said.      \\"If you want to do something you say to your legislators, women should be able to come forward when they decide to come forward, not forced into a particular time frame,\\" Abrams said. \\"You have to change the laws.\\"      Glad Whoopi Goldberg has finally come to terms that Bill Cosby is a rapist. — Eddie (@eddieb2) July 14, 2015      Meanwhile, he said, the public is entitled to conclude that Cosby is guilty of the allegations against him, especially since the accusations seem compelling. \\"It's impossible to ignore the consistency of these stories,\\" he said.      Goldberg said she now understands better that under the current legal system, the women who have accused Cosby have no other recourse except to do what they are doing — attempt to try him in the media.      \\"There's nothing that can be done legally,\\" Goldberg said. \\"All that's left is the court of public opinion.\\"      But, she added, it would have been better for all of the accusers if they had come forward earlier. Some of the women say they were sexually assaulted by Cosby in the 1960s.      \\"I say to women, if something happens, don't wait because it can make it harder to prove your case later,\\" she said.      Director Judd Apatow has been almost as critical of Goldberg as he has of the accused Cosby, imploring her in public to believe the accusers. Comedian John Oliver last week attacked Goldberg, comparing her defense of Cosby to defending torture or Mel Gibson.      So far, neither has tweeted a reaction to Goldberg's 180.      Goldberg was not alone in switching sides. Joseph C. Phillips, the actor who played Cosby's son-in-law on The Cosby Show, parted ways with some of his fellow castmembers (such as Phylicia Rashad) in declaring on his website that he thinks Cosby is guilty even though he still loves him.      \\"Honestly, that phrase may not be enough to sufficiently describe my feelings for Bill. He was my boyhood idol. His influence on my life has been profound. I owe much of who I am to Bill Cosby,\\" wrote Phillips, who describes himself on Twitter as a Christian conservative.      But he was persuaded of Cosby's guilt when a mutual old friend tearfully told him she had been assaulted by Cosby. Phillips said he was not prepared to dismiss Cosby's brilliance or his legacy, but he had some advice for the man he still admires.      \\"Bill, you have a family who loves you, a wife who is devoted to you; you have more money than you can spend. Please, go live a quiet country life. Allow those of us who truly love you to preserve just a bit of our enchantment.\\"      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1IYf20Q ||||| Whoopi Goldberg admitted that the evidence against comedian Bill Cosby is overwhelming on Tuesday’s episode of “The View,” with the comedian saying, “If this is to be tried in the court of public opinion, I got to say all of the information that’s out there kind of points to guilt.”      As recently as last week, Goldberg maintained that Cosby should be considered innocent until proven guilty.      But during a discussion with ABC News’ chief legal analyst Dan Abrams, he explained that there is virtually no legal recourse at this point for Cosby’s accusers as the statute of limitations has expired for them to press criminal charges.

If you want to get an ass– bonehead off the street, if you want to get him off the street, we need you to step out and if you step out then he can be put away.”      “You got a serial rapist, he’s been on the streets for 30 years,” Goldberg continued. “I have to say I thought that, ‘Yeah, here’s all the information, take his ass to jail. I find out from you that that’s not possible. So I can’t say any more ‘innocent until proven guilty’ because there’s no way to prove it.”      Also Read: The Fall of Bill Cosby: A Timeline of His Descent From Beloved 'Superstar' to Accused Sex Offender      Both Abrams and Goldberg encouraged people to write to their legislators to reform state rape statutes. “You say to your legislators, ‘Rape is a crime that shouldn’t have a statute of limitations. Women should be able to come forward when they decide to. They shouldn’t be forced into a particular time frame,'” Abrams said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"John Oliver recently discussed the case of Bill Cosby on his HBO series Last Week Tonight, focusing on Whoopi Goldberg's defense of Cosby amidst allegations of sexual assault.

The late actress wore the slippers in \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"      The 10-year anniversary of the theft is in August. The reward offer requires the exact location of the slippers and the perpetrator's name.            The slippers were insured for 1 million. John Kelsch, executive director of the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minn., says they could be worth 2 million to 3 million now.      Kelsch says the donor is from Arizona and is a huge fan of Garland and the 1939 movie.      Three other pairs created for the film are known to exist, including one on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Another pair was acquired in 2012 for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences' planned museum.

Now an anonymous benefactor has stepped forward and offered a million dollar reward to anyone with credible information about the theft, including the exact location of the slippers and the perpetrator’s name.      The slippers, designed for the 1939 film by legendary Hollywood costumer Adrian, were stolen from the museum, located in Garland’s hometown, in 2005, and haven’t been seen since. John Kelsch, executive director of the museum told the Associated Press that the bounty’s donor is from Arizona and is a huge fan of Garland and the 1939 movie.      At the time of the theft, the ruby slippers, which owe their glitter to burgundy sequins, were insured for 1 million. Kelsch says they could be worth 2 million to 3 million now. The last pair to hit the auction block took in 666,000 in 2000.      In L. Frank Baum’s Oz books, on which the film was based, Dorothy's magical shoes were silver, but according to the Smithsonian, screenwriter Noel Langley changed them to ruby red—possibly so they would stand out better against a yellow brick road. After the film was made, the ruby slippers were stored in MGM’s wardrobe department and more or less forgotten. In 1970 a pair was discovered in MGM’s basement and sold at auction for 15,000 to a still-anonymous buyer, who donated them to the Smithsonian, where they are still on display. Another pair was acquired in 2012 for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences' planned museum. Two other pairs, including the stolen set, are known to exist.      If you have information about the shoes’ whereabouts contact the Grand Rapids Minnesota Police Department at (218) 326-3464. ||||| The footwear is among the most treasured memorabilia in movie history      A 1m reward has been offered for information leading to the recovery of the famous red slippers worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in the Wizard Of Oz.      The sequined, ruby shoes were stolen 10 years ago from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, hometown of the late actress.      An anonymous donor from Arizona, who is a big fan of Garland and the 1939 film, has put up the money, said John Kelsch, the museum's executive director.      The reward requires the precise location of the slippers and the name of the thief.      Garland, who died in 1969, as Dorothy      Last month, Minnesota police checked out a tip that the slippers had been sealed in Tupperware with a weight inside and thrown into an underwater pit.      Dives at the 238ft (72 metre) deep Tioga Mine Pit, in Ithaca County around Grand Rapids, recovered items possibly linked to the case, but no sign of the actual slippers.      The glass case containing the shoes, which were insured for 1m, was smashed with a bat at the museum in August 2005.      The museum says the footwear could now be worth between 2m and 3m.      There are only three other pairs, including one on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.      Dorothy wore silver slippers in the L Frank Baum book on which the movie was based.      But the film's producers changed the shoes' colour to red to make the most of the new Technicolor process.      The gingham dress Garland wore in the movie sold last November for 480,000 at an auction in Beverly Hills. ||||| Last week, Itasca County Sheriff's Office volunteer divers looked for the ruby slippers that were worn by Grand Rapids native Judy Garland in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and were infamously stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids almost a decade ago. The slippers didn't turn up during the four public dives in the Tioga Mine Pit, said Rob Feeney, the museum's volunteer in charge of acquisitions.      But in a practice dive about a week earlier, one of the divers came up with what Feeney coyly described as \\"something that was of interest.\\"      Actually, two somethings: a pair of containers, one a small duffel bag and the other a partially deteriorated tin can. It was apparent the can had been in the bag, Feeney said. \\"They had been down there a while.\\"      The dives were staged at the mine pit, Feeney said, because of longstanding rumors that the slippers — stolen in August, 2005 — had been sealed in Tupperware with a weight inside and tossed in the pit.      The thought that the can and the duffel bag might have contained something was enough reason to turn them over to the Grand Rapids Police Department, Feeney said. As of Monday, police were still examining the items, he said.      Divers didn't discover anything that possibly could have been slipper-related during their public dives, Feeney said. But they did come up, unexpectedly, with a rifle. That, too, remains in police hands.      It might not be all that easy to find a pair of slippers in the Tioga Mine Pit. Although a mere blip among Itasca County's numerous bodies of water, it still covers 51 acres and reaches a depth of 225 feet, according to Minnesota Lake Finder.      The search for the iconic slippers isn't over, Feeney said.      \\"This is really just the beginning,\\" he said. \\"We're never going to stop doing this until they're found or we know what happened to them.\\"      He noted that the statute of limitations on the burglary soon will have run out, perhaps making the miscreant(s) more willing to speak up.      Meanwhile, two individuals have expressed interest in making offers for a carriage that's on display at the museum. Museum co-founder Jon Miner owns the carriage, which was made for President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and later appeared in about 200 movies, including \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" (As if it needs any more creds, it also appeared in John Wayne's last movie, Feeney said.)      Feeney said that Miner is interested in selling the carriage — for the right price — to bolster the endowment for the Children's Discovery Museum, which is attached to the Judy Garland Museum. |||||","output":"An anonymous donor has offered a 1 million reward for credible information leading to the recovery of a pair of Judy Garland's ruby red slippers that were stolen from a museum in her Minnesota hometown.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\".  Guess a valid title for it!

Answer:","output":"Colorado became part of the United States through a series of historical events related to westward expansion and territorial acquisitions. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of when Colorado became part of the United States, it's essential to dive into the history leading up to Colorado's eventual statehood. The land that is now Colorado was initially inhabited by various Indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Spanish were the first Europeans to explore the area and lay a territorial claim. The Spanish influence extended through the southwestern part of the territory, while the northeastern areas were claimed by French fur traders in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson sought to expand the United States and initiated the Louisiana Purchase, which involved acquiring vast territories from France. This purchase extended the United States' western border and included parts of what is now eastern Colorado. While this was the initial introduction of Colorado lands into the United States, it was not an official incorporation just yet. As for the remaining portions of Colorado not included in the Louisiana Purchase, the western sections belonged to Spain as part of the Mexican province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, these lands became part of the Mexican territory. In the mid-19th century, a series of conflicts and treaties defined the fate of the land that now makes up Colorado. The Adams-Onís Treaty in 1819 settled the boundary between Spanish territories and the United States, while the Oregon Treaty of 1846 between the United States and Great Britain clarified the northern border. After the Mexican-American War, which took place between 1846 and 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in February 1848. This treaty officially ceded territories, including parts of present-day Colorado, from Mexico to the United States. Although by this point the majority of Colorado was part of the United States, it would take several more years for the region to become an organized territory. The United States Congress created the Territory of Colorado on February 28, 1861, consolidating parts of Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Utah territories. This territorial designation was the final step before Colorado would be officially incorporated into the United States as a state. Over the next 15 years, Colorado's population increased rapidly due to the gold and silver rush, prompting a push for statehood. Finally, on August 1, 1876, Colorado was admitted to the Union as the 38th state. Known as \\"Centennial State\\" because it became a state 100 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Colorado had officially become part of the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Rec is pretty much the only thing in town for the children, as the Homeowners Association totally forgot about the fact that nearly 25% of the population of New Grenada is under the age of 15. So, naturally, the kids find themselves some other ways to have fun; sex, drugs, alcohol, vandalism, and rock n roll. One of the first scenes shown is Mark Perry (Vincent Spano), and his friend shooting his B.B. gun at oncoming cars on the overpass. However, when they hit a police cruiser, they laugh and cheer, and decide to leave before the cop sees them. They hop on their bikes, and ride down the road, passing Carl and Ritchie, who, when warned by the boys about cops, dive into the weeds behind an electric control box.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which sister had fewer abnormal cells divide uncontrollably?  Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. A:","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, Lisa had cancer, which implies that her cells divided uncontrollably due to mutations. In contrast, her sister Beth didn't have cancer, indicating that her cells followed more normal division patterns.

No. It is not possible to conclude that \\"My mind was crystal clear\\" if your mind was still quite jumbled. These two statements are contradictory and describe opposite states of mental clarity. A jumbled mind refers to a state of confusion, disorganization, or chaos, often resulting from an overload of information, emotions, or stress. In this state, it can be challenging to think and make decisions, as thoughts and ideas can be tangled and unclear. A jumbled mind may also involve racing thoughts, anxiety, or an inability to focus on a specific issue or task. On the other hand, a crystal clear mind signifies a mental state of complete clarity, organization, and focus. In this state, thoughts and ideas are coherent and easily accessible, allowing for efficient decision-making and problem-solving. A crystal clear mind is associated with calmness, serenity, and an ability to concentrate on tasks without distractions. Given that these two concepts represent opposing mental states, it is not possible for both to be true simultaneously. If your mind is jumbled, it cannot simultaneously be crystal clear.

The New York City Police Department receive a call from \\"Simon\\" ordering them that suspended police officer Lt. John McClane be dropped in Harlem wearing a sandwich board that says \\"I hate niggers\\" and threatening to detonate another bomb if they don't comply. They collect McClane and follow Simon's instructions; McClane is saved from a potential attack by young men by Zeus Carver, a nearby shop owner. McClane and Carver escape and return to headquarters, where Simon calls again and threatens to detonate more bombs if McClane and Carver do not follow his instructions. Simon sends the two on a series of children's riddles. He tells them to reach Wall Street station 90 blocks south, within 30 minutes to stop a bomb planted on a Brooklyn-bound 3 train. McClane boards the subway while Carver drives. McClane locates the bomb and throws it off the train, it still detonates, derailing the train and sending it through the station with minimal injuries due to Carver's warnings. As McClane and Carver regroup with the police, they are met by FBI agents, who reveal Simon is Peter Krieg, a former Colonel in the East German People's Army and a mercenary-for-hire. Krieg is after McClane as Krieg's birth name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber whom McClane had previously killed in Nakatomi Towers. Simon calls the police, knowing the FBI is there, that he has planted a bomb in a public school and rigged with a radio detonator triggered by the police band. Simon tells them that he will get McClane and Carver the school's location if they continue to play his game. While McClane and Carver set off on Simon's next task, the police organize all the city's public works to begin searching schools, using 9-1-1 to coordinate activities.

Article: There's nothing worse than being fake, because then your \\"friends\\" won't like you for you. Have the confidence to know that you're an amazing person who has a lot to offer, and you'll be more likely to attract a diverse group of interesting people. Don't tell people what you think they want to hear just to make them like you and avoid bragging just to make yourself sound cool. People will be able to tell if you're just trying to impress them or suck up to them, and you'll be less likely to make friends with them. Instead, slowly open up and let people know about who you are and the things that really matter to you. Also if you are fake chances are that people will notice and they will talk making this even harder for you.  If you only become popular by trying to be someone you're not, then where's the fun in it? You don't want to keep up a charade forever, do you? Remember that if you have to completely change who you are to get people to like you, then it probably isn't worth it. Nobody likes a stuck up person. Smile to the people you know in the hallways. Don't act like you're better than them; arrogance is a huge turn off. If someone mentions you, you want them to talk about your good side, not your bad side. However, don't overdo it or they'll just start using you. You may think that you have to act like one of the Mean Girls to be popular, but in reality, this won't get you very far.  To be truly nice, you should be polite and have good manners. This means holding doors for people, saying hello to people you know, making room for people walking in the halls, and being friendly even if you're in a bad mood. This doesn't mean you have to put on that false cheery persona you can sometimes see from adults; it just means that you should be kind to people, regardless of how popular you think they are. There's nothing worse than a person who is only nice to popular people or people who he thinks can get him somewhere. If you're mean to the people \\"below\\" you and nice to the people \\"above\\" you, then people will be on to you pretty soon. If you want to make genuine friends, then you can't let people walk all over you. If you stick to your guns and know when to defend yourself, you'll actually gain respect and will be more likely to make more friends and to gain popularity. If you're nice to people just because you want them to like you, you won't get very far and you won't be respected.  If someone is being mean to you, making you feel bad about yourself, and just generally putting you down for no reason, you shouldn't have to take it. Let the person know that his or her actions are unacceptable.  You don't have to stoop down to a person's level just because the person is being mean to you. You can tell someone to stop what he or she is doing without calling names or being mean in return. Remember that you're better than that. If you're friendly and are always going up to new people and making small talk with them, you'll be on your way to easily making friends. You should be excited to get to know new people, no matter what crowd they're in or what grade they're in. Of course, you should take it slow and not bombard new people, or people who look busy, but if you find an opportunity to talk to someone new, like if you're at your locker by yourself with another person at his locker standing next to you, then you should take it. When you're talking to new people, you should take things easy, talking about your classes, your hobbies, or what music you like. Ask the person a few easy questions to show that you care. You can talk about the serious stuff later, when you get to know each other better. The key to being truly social and popular is not to talk about yourself all the time or to brag, but to show a real interest in other people. As the saying goes, you should be interested, not interesting. People will like you a lot more if you ask them questions and show that you care about them than if you try to show off. The next time you talk to someone, smile, ask questions about the person's day, make eye contact, and show that you really do care. This doesn't mean you should fake it, but that you should make an effort to make people feel like they are cared for. Here are some things you can do:  Ask the person about how his weekend went. Ask people about something new to be shared. Ask about their likes and dislikes. Ask about the person's extra-curricular activities Compliment something the person is wearing Ask about something the person mentioned last time Find a balance between talking about yourself and the other person Sure, high school is a time when many people act like they are literally too cool for school. They may wear too much eyeliner, hunch over in class, show up late, or shrug when their teachers reprimand them. However, this should not be the way you approach high school. Embrace the fact that it's okay to care, and that you should try to go after the things that matter to you instead of worrying that you'll come off like a dork. If you really like English class, get excited about talking about your favorite book; if you love being on the tennis team, tell your friends about your upcoming match. Talking about the things that make you happy will make you a more exciting, engaging person. Give your opinions too. Agreeing with the opposite person and simply nodding to whatever they say will make you look very boring. Try to be a conversation starter and know when to listen and when to answer back to people. Small talk is a skill that many high school students lack, and if you know how to make small talk, you'll up your social game and will be on your way to being more popular. To make small talk, you just have to be able to chat with people about anything at all when you see them in the halls, without getting nervous or running out of things to say. Just relax, stop worrying about saying the wrong thing, and make the other person comfortable as you engage in a quick conversation in the halls or before class starts. Here are some things you can do when you make small talk:  Talk about the class you just came from or were going to. Ask the person about his or her weekend. Talk about anything coming up in school, such as the fall dance or football game, and ask if the person is going. Chat about something in your environment, such as a flyer for the pep rally, or a shirt the person is wearing with the name of your favorite college on it. You may think that the last thing you want to do in high school is to every smile at anyone, because smiling is just so uncool, but you should change your attitude if you want to be more social and get on your way to being more popular. Smiling will make you more approachable, will make more people notice you, and will make more people likely to feel welcome in your presence. It's a big part of being friendly. You don't have to smile at absolutely everyone in your school, but if you walk by someone in the halls, take a chance and give that person a little smile, even if you don't know him or her. Let's face it. People in high school tend to be judgmental, and are likely to think that someone is mean or rude for no reason. If you smile more, people will be much more likely to think you're a welcoming, open person. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, being genuine and avoiding fake behavior is crucial for establishing strong, meaningful relationships and friendships. Gaining popularity should not involve changing who you are or trying to impress others. Instead, be confident in yourself, be nice to everyone regardless of their social status, and stand up for yourself when necessary. Show genuine interest in others by asking questions, talking about common interests, and listening attentively. Be enthusiastic about your passions and never be afraid to express your opinions. Work on improving your small talk skills, which can significantly enhance your social life. Smiling more can make you more approachable and create a positive impression. Embrace the fact that it's okay to care about your interests and pursue them. By presenting yourself as a friendly, authentic, and engaging person, you can attract a diverse group of people and cultivate meaningful connections. High school is a time of growth and exploration, and embracing your true self will ultimately lead to greater satisfaction and stronger friendships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's called the \\"Mini Fountain\\" and it's perfect for hot summer days when you want to play with water. Let's learn how to make it! Materials: To get started, grab these items from your home: 1. An empty plastic bottle (like a soda or water bottle) 2. A pair of scissors (ask an adult for help) 3. A bucket or a plastic container (it should be a little bigger than the bottle) 4. Some water! Now, let's start making our mini fountain! Step 1: Cut the bottom off the empty plastic bottle First, we need to give our bottle a haircut. Ask an adult to help you cut the bottom off the plastic bottle using the scissors. Be careful, and remember, always ask for help when using sharp tools! Step 2: Find a bigger bucket or plastic container Next, let's find a good home for our fountain. Look for a bucket or a plastic container that's a little bit bigger than the bottle you just cut. This will be the \\"pool\\" where our fountain will live. Step 3: Fill the bucket or container with water Now, it's time to get that fountain flowing! Grab the bucket or container that you found, and fill it up with water. Don't make it too full; just enough so it can hold the water as it splashes out from your fountain. Step 4: Put the cut bottle in the water Place the cut bottle, with its open bottom facing up, into the water-filled bucket or container. You can hold it with your hand or ask an adult to help you prop it up. Now, watch as the water goes into the bottle and comes pouring out like a mini fountain! Conclusion: Congratulations, you've just made your very own mini fountain! This simple, yet exciting project, is a great way to learn about recycling and enjoy a fun water play activity at the same time. You can even add a little twist by adding some food coloring to the water, decorating the bottle, or using different sized buckets to create a bigger fountain. The possibilities are endless!

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Bad News Bears Movie plot: Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is a washed-up alcoholic baseball player who was a pitcher for the Seattle Mariners before getting kicked out of professional baseball for attacking an umpire. He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He coaches the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit after but Buttermaker forces them out of quitting and promises to be a better coach. Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft), a skilled pitcher, is the 12-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends. After a couple requests, she decides to join the team. Kelly Leak, a local troublemaker but solid hitter, also joins the team, and the Bears start winning games. The Bears eventually make it to the championship game. In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) has his son Joey intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and would leave the game with his mother. Later, Buttermaker changes the lineup, putting the benchwarmers in and taking out some of the good players which causes the Bears to fall behind heading into the last half of the inning. With two outs, one of the Bears players, Garo, drives in two runs and tries to score to tie the game but is thrown out at the plate on a close call, causing the Bears to lose the championship 8â7.

Given the following context:  Marquee Moon was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on the country's albums chart. The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where \\"all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.\\"By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure.

Does it make sense to study Mathematics at undergraduate level, then MIS in graduate school, and then a second Master’s or PhD in economics? How many solar panels do I need to produce 1300 kWh?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning as they are related to entirely different subjects. Let's break down each question separately: 1. \\"Does it make sense to study Mathematics at undergraduate level, then MIS in graduate school, and then a second Master’s or PhD in economics?\\" This question is about the feasibility and practicality of pursuing a specific sequence of academic degrees in different fields. The person asking the question wants to know if it is reasonable and beneficial to first study Mathematics at an undergraduate level, then pursue a Master in Information Systems (MIS), and finally obtain a second master's degree or a PhD in Economics. It is essential to examine the objectives of each field of study and the career goals of the individual making this inquiry. Studying Mathematics at the undergraduate level can provide a strong foundation in analytical reasoning, problem-solving, and mathematical theories. A Master in Information Systems focuses on the practical application of technology for data processing, communication, and management. Lastly, a master's degree or PhD in Economics deals with understanding and analyzing the forces that shape economic decisions and policies. Combining such diverse fields of study can be advantageous for individuals who are aiming for careers involving multiple disciplines or specializing in an interdisciplinary area. It may also offer a broader understanding of various concepts and translate into a strong analytical skill set. However, it would be beneficial to carefully consider the overlap between these fields and how each degree would contribute to the individual's long-term career goals. 2. \\"How many solar panels do I need to produce 1300 kWh?\\" This question is about calculating the number of solar panels necessary for generating a specific amount of energy – 1300 kilowatt-hours (kWh). To answer this question, several factors need to be considered, such as the efficiency of solar panels, the amount of sunlight available in the location where they will be installed, and the energy consumption patterns of the user. First, determine the average output (in watts) of a solar panel. Solar panels come in various sizes and efficiencies, but for the purpose of this example, let's assume that a standard solar panel produces 250 watts. Understanding that 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we can convert the desired energy production to kW: 1300 kWh = 1.3 MWh (megawatt-hours). Next, consider the number of sun hours per day in the location where the solar panels will be installed. These are the average daily effective hours of sunlight exposure. For our example, let's assume that the location receives an average of 4 sun hours per day. We can now calculate the total wattage needed: 1.3 MWh / 30 days / 4 sun hours = 10.83 kW per day. Divide the desired wattage by the wattage of a single solar panel to find the total number of solar panels necessary: 10.83 kW / 0.250 kW = 43.32 solar panels. Since you can't have a fraction of a solar panel, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, 44 solar panels would be necessary to produce approximately 1300 kWh per month in this example. Keep in mind that the exact number of solar panels depends on factors such as panel efficiency, sun hours, and specific energy needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous. The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact. What is the answer to this question: What was a way to reach the economic goals of the Ottoman economic system?","output":"The Ottoman economic system aimed to maintain and consolidate the ruler's power, enhance state revenues, and ensure the prosperity of subjects while preventing social disorder and maintaining social and traditional organization. One way to achieve these economic goals was through taxation policies that were designed to stimulate economic growth, promote trade, and create a conducive environment for the productive classes to flourish. Taxation policies in the Ottoman Empire were structured around a tax-farming system, known as the Iltizam system, where individuals or groups of individuals would secure the rights to collect taxes on behalf of the state for a specific period in exchange for an upfront payment to the state treasury. The tax farmers in the Ottoman Empire, known as \\"mültezim,\\" were responsible for obtaining the highest possible revenue while ensuring that the taxpayers were not overburdened. The tax system in the Ottoman Empire was very efficient and flexible, as it allowed tax rates to be adjusted according to the economic conditions and the ability of the subjects to pay. The Ottomans were particularly concerned with preventing the emergence of social disorder by ensuring that the productive classes remained prosperous. As a result, tax exemptions or reductions were granted to subjects during years of bad harvest, natural disasters, or war, which helped maintain the prosperity of the productive classes and the society as a whole. Trade was another vital component of the Ottoman economic system. The empire sought to promote and regulate trade through various measures, such as the establishment of equitable and predictable customs duties, the maintenance and expansion of efficient transportation networks, and the fostering of an environment conducive to regional and international trade. Ottoman rulers actively encouraged merchants, artisans, and skilled craftsmen to settle in the empire, and they provided them with various incentives in the form of tax exemptions, property rights, and other privileges. Agriculture, craft production, and mining were essential economic activities in the Ottoman Empire, and the state implemented policies to support the development of these sectors. Sustainable agricultural practices were promoted through the so-called \\"timar\\" system, in which land was granted to military officers who, in exchange for their military service, were required to cultivate the lands, collect taxes from peasants, and maintain order. This system provided incentives for landholders to invest in and develop agricultural land, thus contributing to the overall prosperity of the empire. Furthermore, a guild system was in place, which controlled various aspects of craft production and trade in the Ottoman cities. The guilds maintained quality standards, controlled prices, and regulated competition among the artisans. The state sponsored and protected certain strategic industries, such as silk production and weapon manufacturing, by granting them monopolies and other privileges. To summarize, the Ottoman economic system aimed to achieve its economic goals by implementing and maintaining a range of policies that focused on taxation, trade, agriculture, and craft production. These policies were designed to promote the prosperity of the productive classes, increase state revenues, and prevent social disorder, all while maintaining the traditional organization of society. By providing incentives and support to key economic sectors, the Ottoman Empire sought to strike a balance between state control and economic freedom, ultimately fostering growth and stability within the empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Julian Paul Assange (; ne Hawkins; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer and the editor of WikiLeaks. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, but came to international attention in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the federal government of the United States launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. Context: Assange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women with whom he had sex. He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was re-opened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \\"lesser-degree rape\\" (mindre grov valdtakt). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain.  In 2010, the prosecutor said Swedish law prevented her from questioning anyone by video link or in the London embassy. In March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, she changed her mind and agreed to interrogate Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, with interviews finally beginning on 14 November 2016. These interviews involved police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials and were eventually published online. By this time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \\"lesser degree rape\\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020.  On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities dropped their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \\"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\\", she said. Question: What were the results of the allegations?. Whats the answer?","output":"The results of the allegations against Julian Assange were a complex series of events that spanned several years, ultimately leading to the investigation being dropped in 2017. Here is a summary of the outcomes and the current status: 1. Initial Investigation and Reopening the Case: In August 2010, Assange became the subject of sexual assault allegations in Sweden. The case was initially closed, but later re-opened in November 2010 by a special prosecutor. 2. Asylum at Ecuadorian Embassy: Assange sought and was granted asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in June 2012. He remained within the embassy's premises until April 2019 to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden. 3. Change in Swedish Law: In 2015, due to public criticism, Swedish law was changed to allow interrogation of individuals through video link or within an embassy. This allowed Swedish officials to interrogate Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in November 2016. 4. Expiration of Statute of Limitations: By the time Assange was interrogated, the statute of limitations had expired for three of the four allegations. The only remaining charge was \\"lesser-degree rape,\\" with a statute of limitations that would expire in 2020. 5. Dropping the Investigation: On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities dropped the investigation against Assange, citing difficulties in communicating reliably with him through the Ecuadorian Embassy. The arrest warrant was revoked with the possibility of the investigation being resumed if Assange were to visit Sweden before August 2020. 6. No Pronouncement of Guilt: The Swedish prosecutor, Marianne Ny, emphasized that dropping the case does not indicate a pronouncement about Assange's guilt or innocence.

For nine generations Eklavya's family has protected Devigarh, a centuries-old citadel in Rajasthan. His marksmanship is the stuff of legends. His unflinching loyalty inspires ballads.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What band is Black Francis the frontman for? ?  Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy. A:","output":"Black Francis is the frontman for the band Pixies.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.\\"?

Does it follow that \\"The agency references the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.\\"?","output":"Yes, when one states that \\"The agency cites the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.,\\" it is equivalent to saying \\"The agency references the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.\\" Both phrases indicate that the agency is using the Clean Air Act as a source or as support for their statement, decision, regulation, or any other related task. The words 'cite' and 'reference' are used interchangeably in this context and convey the same meaning. The Clean Air Act, which is codified under Title 42 of the United States Code, is a federal law enacted to control air pollution on a national level. The primary objective of this Act is to ensure public health and welfare by regulating the emissions of hazardous air pollutants and certain criteria pollutants from various sources. The Act was first passed in 1963 and has undergone several revisions and amendments since then. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the leading federal agency responsible for implementing and enforcing the provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA achieves this goal by establishing National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for specified pollutants, establishing emissions standards for stationary and mobile sources, regulating the production and use of several chemical substances, and developing comprehensive plans to address air quality in specific regions.  The Clean Air Act has played a crucial role in achieving significant improvements in air quality in the United States. The law has been instrumental in reducing air pollution levels, eliminating approximately 70% of the aggregate emissions of six of the most prevalent pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide, between 1970 to 2020. These reductions have led to improvements in public health, agriculture, ecosystems, and overall quality of life for millions of Americans. In conclusion, when one states that \\"The agency cites the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.,\\" it means that the agency is referring to the Clean Air Act and using its provisions to support a position or decision. The statement also implies that the agency recognizes the importance of the Clean Air Act and its role in maintaining and improving air quality across the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What suite written for military band remains a brassbands staple? , can you please find it?   Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument.  The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce).  Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building.  The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War.  Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings.  St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee.  Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871.  The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road.  It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896.  The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane.  For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the first building at Covent Garden? , can you please find it?   The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street.

He realizes that the best way to learn physics is to solve problems. To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which scenario's unit would most likely be used in everyday world, scenario A or scenario D? The answer is:","output":"Scenario D Step 1: Identify the given units of pressure in each scenario: - Scenario A: Pascals (Pa) - Scenario B: atmospheres (atm) - Scenario C: torr - Scenario D: pounds per square inch (psi) Step 2: Consider the context of the task - \\"everyday world\\" Step 3: Evaluate which units are more commonly used in everyday scenarios: - Pascals are the SI unit for pressure and are commonly used in scientific contexts and calculations. - Pounds per square inch (psi) is a unit of pressure that is more familiar and commonly used in everyday life, especially in countries using the Imperial System, such as the United States.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who said they used to be cruel to women? ?  Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She...

NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston. We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina,\\" he said. Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston \\"had honored their obligation, this would not be an issue.\\"  Question: \\"How many years after its creation did NLAP buy up some property at 607 Main St. in Conway.\\" Response: \\"12 years later\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Pick your answer from:  --no;  --yes;","output":"--yes; The response to the question is factually correct. The text states that NLAP was created in 1968 and used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway in 1980.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What do Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health and Bolling v. Sharpe have in common? The answer to this question is:","output":"While Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health and Bolling v. Sharpe are different in their specifics, they share a common thread as they both pertain to legally reinforced rights. Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health (1990) and Bolling v. Sharpe (1954) are landmark cases in US legal history, but they pertain to different areas of law and rights. The commonality between the two is that both cases are concerned with the question of constitutionally protected rights and the tension between individual rights and state or societal interests. In Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health, the Supreme Court recognized an individual's constitutional right, under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, to refuse unwanted life-saving medical treatment. This emphasized the role of personal liberty and autonomy in constitutional rights, albeit the court upheld Missouri's requirement for clear and convincing evidence of a patient's wish to be removed from life support. On the other hand, Bolling v. Sharpe involved a ruling in which the Supreme Court interpreted the 5th Amendment's due process clause to include an equal protection component, thereby making segregation in the public schools of Washington, D.C., unconstitutional. This clarified the idea that constitutional rights extend to protection against discrimination. So in essence, both cases dealt with fundamental rights as interpreted by the US Supreme Court, albeit in different contexts. Both increased the scope of rights protected by the Constitution - Cruzan with respect to autonomy and personal liberty in medical decisions, and Bolling with respect to equal protection and non-discrimination."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Texans rebounded from their worst performance of the year with arguably one of their best as they had limited Baltimore's revitalized offense to just 13, forcing two turnovers in an impressive win going into the bye week.  It was the first time the Texans had ever defeated the Ravens in their franchise history (they had lost the previous six meetings, including the playoff matchup).  Reliant Stadium set a new Texans home attendance record of 71,708 fans during the regular season.  Likewise, the Ravens and Texans were the only 2 teams in the AFC who were above .500 at the point of this game.  However, the Texans surprisingly won it as the team went into their bye week at 6-1 and also went 1-6 all-time against the Ravens. The Texans punted to the Ravens who kicked a field goal to take a 3-0 lead. 3 drives later, Joe Flacco was sacked in his own endzone. That gave Houston 2 points and the ball. It was 3-2. Matt Schuab found Kevin Walters to make it 9-3 at the end of the first. Then Flacco was picked off at the Houston 48. Jonathan Joseph ran it back 52 yards for a touchdown to make it 16-3.

After the disruption of the plot in Amman, it had not escaped notice in Washington that Hijazi had lived in California and driven a cab in Boston and that Deek was a naturalized U.S. citizen who, as Berger reminded President Clinton, had been in touch with extremists in the United States as well as abroad. Before Ressam's arrest, Berger saw no need to raise a public alarm at home- although the FBI put all field offices on alert. Now, following Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps. Both Berger andTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap requests were processed during the millennium alert than ever before. The next day, writing about Ressam's arrest and links to a cell in Montreal, Berger informed the President that the FBI would advise police in the United States to step up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by stressing that the government had no specific information about planned attacks. At a December 22 meeting of the Small Group of principals, FBI Director Louis Freeh briefed officials from the NSC staff, CIA, and Justice on wiretaps and investigations inside the United States, including a Brooklyn entity tied to the Ressam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on seven U.S. cities, two Algerians detained on the Canadian border, and searches in Montreal related to a jihadist cell. The Justice Department released a statement on the alert the same day. Clarke's staff warned, \\"Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the US and attacks in the US are likely.\\" Clarke asked Berger to try to make sure that the domestic agencies remained alert.\\" Is there a threat to civilian aircraft?\\"he wrote. Clarke also asked the principals in late December to discuss a foreign security service report about a  Bin Laden plan to put bombs on transatlantic flights. The CSG met daily. Berger said that the principals met constantly. Later, when asked what made her decide to ask Ressam to step out of his vehicle, Diana Dean, a Customs inspector who referred Ressam to secondary inspection, testified that it was her \\"training and experience.\\" It appears that the heightened sense of alert at the national level played no role in Ressam's detention. There was a mounting sense of public alarm. The earlier Jordanian arrests had been covered in the press, and Ressam's arrest was featured on network evening news broadcasts throughout the Christmas season. The FBI was more communicative during the millennium crisis than it had ever been.  After reading the above, is \\"FISA wiretap requests\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Following Ressam's arrest, which type of wiretap requests were being requested?\\"?

As mentioned in the text, both Berger and Tenet had the impression that more FISA wiretap requests were processed during the millennium alert than ever before.

Context: The Bears began their season at Lambeau Field for a Sunday night battle with their hated rival, the Green Bay Packers.  After a scoreless first quarter, Chicago trailed early as Packers kicker Mason Crosby got a 52-yard field goal.  The Bears would respond with safety Danieal Manning sacking quarterback Aaron Rodgers in his own endzone for a safety, but Green Bay would respond as running back Ryan Grant got a 1-yard touchdown run. Chicago would take the lead in the third quarter as quarterback Jay Cutler completed a 36-yard pass to wide receiver Devin Hester, along with kicker Robbie Gould making a 47-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the lead went back and forth in the fourth quarter.  Crosby would kick a 39-yard field goal, while Gould nailed a 21-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Packers took the lead again as Rodgers completed a 50-yard touchdown pass and the following two-point conversion to wide receiver Greg Jennings.  The Bears tried to rally, but an interception ended any hope of a comeback. Cutler's 4 interceptions were the most he had thrown in one game of his career, until week 10 against the 49ers. Question: How many yards longer was Crosby's longest field goal over Gould's longest one?

While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers a series of payments made for the same death. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the Labor Day weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partner Vito (Louis Giambalvo), Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed. However, after Bernie leaves, Vito decides Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his greed and his relationship with Vito's girlfriend, Tina (Catherine Parks), and orders that he be killed instead. Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and plans the murders with Paulie (Don Calfa), the hitman, on the phone, unaware the conversation is being recorded on his answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, killing Bernie with a drug overdose. When Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's house, they find Bernie's body. Before they can call the police, guests arrive for a party that Bernie used to host every weekend. To Larry and Richard's amazement, the guests are too engrossed in their partying to notice he is dead, with the dopey grin from the fatal injection and his sunglasses concealing his lifeless state. Fearing implication in Bernie's death, and wanting to enjoy the luxury of the house for the weekend, Larry proposes he and Richard maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive, a notion that Richard finds absurd. Only the arrival of Richard's office crush, Gwen Saunders (Catherine Mary Stewart), convinces him to go along with Larry's plan.

He booked several plane tickets in his ex-girlfriend's name in March. Trip includes flights to Milan, Paris, Bangkok and New Delhi.","output":"Title: A Toronto Man's Quest to Find Elizabeth Gallagher: Love in the Time of Wanderlust In a tale that seems straight out of a romantic novel, a 28-year-old Toronto man has embarked on a search for a Canadian woman named Elizabeth Gallagher. You might be wondering what sparked this unique quest, and how fortune might favor those who share names with his former flame. Originally, the man had planned an elaborate, globe-trotting adventure for his then-girlfriend, Elizabeth Gallagher. The grand plan was conceptualized in March, with tickets booked for flights to Milan, Paris, Bangkok, and New Delhi. His vision encompassed breathtaking cityscapes, long walks through meandering streets, and intimate moments in exotic locations – the stuff that unforgettable love stories are made of. However, destiny had other plans. The couple parted ways, but the Toronto man couldn't bear the thought of letting the once-in-a-lifetime trip go to waste. Being the hopeless romantic that he is, he felt that this journey could still hold magic for someone with the same name as his ex-girlfriend. And so, the search commenced for another Canadian woman named Elizabeth Gallagher. The idea might seem far-fetched to some, but such instances have occurred in the past where strangers with the same name come together through serendipity, forming unexpected bonds. Furthermore, in the age of social media, finding someone who fits the bill is not an impossible task. Channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can be utilized to locate and connect with this elusive Elizabeth Gallagher. Will this unconventional search lead to a serendipitous connection, or merely remain a quixotic tale? Only time will tell. Regardless of the outcome, this story stands as a testament to the belief that love and adventure can sometimes take us to unexpected places. In a world that can often seem mundane, this Toronto man's quest reminds us to keep our hearts open to the possibility of creating new stories, even when the old ones don't play out as expected. So, to all the Elizabeth Gallaghers out there, an incredible journey might just be a message away – and who knows, it could even lead to the plot twist that romantic tales are made of."},{"instruction":"I can use this background: Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice reduces the planet's average albedo, possibly resulting in global warming in a positive feedback mechanism. Research shows that the Arctic may become ice free in the summer for the first time in human history within by 2040. Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.Warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global ocean current patterns. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.As the extent of sea ice diminishes and sea level rises, the effect of storms such as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 on open water increases, as does possible salt-water damage to vegetation on shore at locations such as the Mackenzie's river delta as stronger storm surges become more likely.Global warming has increased encounters between polar bears and humans. Reduced sea ice due to melting is causing polar bears to search for new sources of food.

Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.  I am facing a new situation today: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which car would emit less unburned hydrocarbons, car A or car B?","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article about the function of catalytic converters, car A with the catalytic converter will emit less unburned hydrocarbons compared to car B, which does not have a catalytic converter.  Catalytic converters work by increasing the rate of several important chemical reactions in the exhaust gases, which reduces the emission of harmful pollutants. Unburned hydrocarbons are one such pollutant that gets released during the combustion of fuel in a car engine. When exhaust gases from the combustion process pass through a catalytic converter, the unburned hydrocarbons present in these gases react with the catalyst to form less harmful compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water. In the case of car A with the catalytic converter, the harmful unburned hydrocarbons will undergo this conversion, thus reducing the amount of unburned hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere. Conversely, car B without a catalytic converter will not have this process taking place, and the exhaust gases from its engine will still contain unburned hydrocarbons, which will be released directly into the environment. While John may find the design of the older car, car B, more attractive, its lack of a catalytic converter means that it will emit higher levels of unburned hydrocarbons. In terms of emissions and environmental impact, car A with the catalytic converter would be a better choice as it releases fewer unburned hydrocarbons, contributing to a cleaner atmosphere and reduced air pollution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In his Harvard \\"Lectures on Pragmatism\\" (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the \\"three cotary propositions of pragmatism\\" (L: cos, cotis whetstone), saying that they \\"put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism\\". First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street. That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses. Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word, incorrigible. This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or \\"thisness\\" – what the Scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction. Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them. This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research, most recently for instance with the work of Irvin Rock on indirect perception.

Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.  and a hint : Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  Please answer this question : Who is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Ronaldo is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff. There are several reasons behind this, which are primarily rooted in their differing dietary habits.  As a nutrition enthusiast, Ronaldo consumes a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. By doing so, he ensures that he is obtaining the essential lipids needed for proper body functioning while avoiding the risks associated with high-fat diets. In contrast, Jeff's diet consists of an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol due to his unrestricted eating habits. Consuming too many lipids may lead to unhealthy weight gain, as lipids are very high in energy. A high-fat diet has several consequences, including an increased likelihood of weight gain and increased lipid levels in the blood. Elevated blood lipid levels can contribute to various health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. Cholesterol is the lipid primarily responsible for narrowing arteries, leading to atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by plaque buildup in the arterial walls. Atherosclerosis can ultimately result in serious cardiovascular issues such as heart attacks and strokes. Given this information, it is clear that Ronaldo's balanced nutritional approach, which includes a diet with appropriate amounts of fat and cholesterol, makes him less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff. Furthermore, by maintaining a well-rounded diet, Ronaldo also minimizes the potential risks associated with consuming excessive lipids, such as cardiovascular diseases, making his lifestyle a more health-conscious one.

He joins up with several other babies in an attempt to stop Biscane, who intends to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the world's population by brainwashing them and forcing people to not be active and watch TV the rest of their lives. The film starts with a group of babies in a day care centre. Archie tells the others (Finkelman, Alex, and Rosita) a story about a super baby called Kahuna. Kahuna rescues kids all around the world. According to Archie, Kahuna rescued a group of children from an orphanage run by the evil Kane. Kahuna and Kane are nemeses and hate each other, but Kahuna always wins their battles. Archie's father Stan, who seems to own the day care centre, is letting it be used as a television set by the evil Biscane (yes, in other words, Kane) who is starting up his own TV channel. Archie notices someone spying on the goings-on at the television set in the bushes, but he isn't sure who it is. However, he begins to believe Biscane is evil. He and the other babies sneak into Stan's office and decide to check out Biscane, but are spammed. When they hear some of Biscane's cronies approaching, Rosita, Alex and Finkelman run away, leaving Archie by himself.

He is the main hero who assists the four baby geniuses in combating the antagonist Bill Biscane, later revealed as Kane. The baby geniuses, Archie, Finkelman, Alex, and Rosita, have the ability to communicate using 'baby talk' and possess knowledge about numerous secrets. They become entangled in a scheme orchestrated by media mogul Bill Biscane, who intends to kidnap children all over the world. Biscane's evil plan involves employing a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the global population by brainwashing them and forcing them to watch television incessantly, subsequently leading to a life of inactivity. Kahuna plays a significant role in thwarting Biscane's malicious pursuits and rescuing children from being kidnapped. His heroic deeds include stopping Biscane's plots and saving children from various perils due to his extraordinary abilities. Kahuna teams up with the group of baby geniuses in their mission to hinder Biscane, with whom he shares a nemesis-like relationship. The movie begins at a daycare center, where Archie recounts the story of the super baby, Kahuna. He describes Kahuna's feats of rescuing kids around the world, including children from an orphanage run by the evil Kane. As the story unfolds, Archie's father Stan, who owns the daycare center, permits Biscane to use the facility as a television set for his new TV channel. Archie catches sight of somebody spying on the television set's activities and starts suspecting Biscane's ill intentions. Archie, along with the other babies, infiltrates Stan's office to seek information on Biscane. However, they are disrupted by Biscane's accomplices; while Rosita, Alex, and Finkelman flee, Archie remains behind. He eavesdrops on the cronies discussing Biscane's plan but struggles to comprehend it. Archie accidentally draws their attention but is saved by Kahuna, who continues to stand against Biscane and safeguard the welfare of children across the globe. In summary, the super baby in \\"SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2\\" is Kahuna, a legendary baby with extraordinary powers who collaborates with the baby geniuses to prevent Bill Biscane from executing his sinister intentions of brainwashing the world's population and promoting a sedentary lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was founded as part of Magdalen College, Oxford, by William Waynflete in 1480.  - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time.  - A game show is a type of radio, television, or internet programming genre in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles usually for money and/or prizes. Alternatively, a \\"gameshow\\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony). In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement. One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows. Some TV game shows fall under the category of reality television.  - A presenter is a person who introduces or hosts television programs (or segments thereof such as an infomercial advertiser) Nowadays, it is common for minor celebrities in other fields to take on this role, but some people have made their name solely within the field of presenting, particularly within children's television series, to become television personalities.  - BBC Entertainment is an international television channel broadcasting comedy, drama, light entertainment, reality and children's programming (some regions only) from the BBC, Channel 4 and other UK production houses. The channel broadcasts regional versions to suit local demands and replaces BBC Prime. It is wholly owned by BBC Worldwide.  - Jon Briggs (born 24 January 1965) is an English TV and radio presenter.

The Prep School (children aged 8-13) and Dragon Pre-Prep (aged 4-7) are both co-educational schools based in Oxford. The Dragon Prep School founded in 1877 as the Oxford Preparatory School is one of England's best known boarding schools, although it also takes day pupils.   - BBC Prime was the BBC's general entertainment TV channel in Europe and the Middle East from 30 January 1995 until 11 November 2009, when it was replaced by BBC Entertainment.  - Light entertainment is the broad range of usually televisual performances. These include comedies, variety shows, quiz/game shows, sketch shows and people/surprise shows.  - A journalist is a person who collects, writes, or distributes news or other current information. A journalist's work is called journalism. A journalist can work with general issues or specialize in certain issues. However, most journalists tend to specialize, and by cooperating with other journalists, produce journals that span many topics. For example, a sports journalist covers news within the world of sports, but this journalist may be a part of a newspaper that covers many different topics.

Write an article based on this summary: The election Theresa May is seeking for 8 June would have a useful side-effect for her - by helping the Conservative Party in its attempts to put the lingering embarrassment of the 2015 general election expenses affair behind it. Article:","output":"Title: Election on 8 June: A Convenient Side-Effect for Theresa May and the Conservative Party Introduction The snap election called by UK Prime Minister Theresa May for 8 June 2021, is proving to be more than just an opportunity to secure a mandate for the Brexit negotiations. As it turns out, the election might provide the perfect opportunity for the Conservative Party to leave the lingering embarrassment of the 2015 general election expenses scandal in the past once and for all. The 2015 General Election Expenses Affair: A Brief Overview To understand the significance of this side-effect, it is necessary to revisit the 2015 general election expenses scandal. The Conservative Party faced accusations of overspending and misreporting of election expenses during the 2015 general election campaign, which led to a significant amount of unfavorable media coverage and put the party's credibility at risk. The scandal involved several local candidates and officials, including MPs, who allegedly failed to declare the expenses related to battle bus tours and accommodation costs. If proven guilty, the Conservative Party could have faced a significant financial penalty, an unfavorable verdict that might have contributed to its declining support among the electorate. However, many of the accused were ultimately cleared in May 2017, lifting some of the burden off the party's shoulders. The Snap Election: A Fresh Start for the Conservative Party With the snap election just around the corner, the Conservative Party now has the chance to move on from the expenses scandal that once threatened to derail its success. The election offers a convenient opportunity to shift focus from past shortcomings to a strong and stable leadership, as well as policies that support economic growth, national security, and a successful Brexit negotiation. Additionally, the Conservative Party, currently enjoying a considerable lead in the polls, has a golden chance to increase its majority in the House of Commons. A larger majority would enable Prime Minister Theresa May to move forward with her Brexit plans without facing unnecessary obstacles from opposition parties. Conclusion By seeking an election on 8 June, Prime Minister Theresa May has not only created a chance to solidify her position on Brexit but has also inadvertently provided a much-needed opportunity for the Conservative Party to move past the election expenses scandal. As the election campaign progresses, it is expected that the party will be able to distance itself from the scandal further, focusing on policies aimed at securing a successful future for the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary's very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary's roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \\"Mary Brave\\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Tori's rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation. When the three are jogging one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal and becomes obsessed with caring for it as she believes that something untoward has happened to its parents. While Paulie tends to the orphaned falcon, Mary and Tori meet some boys from the nearby boys' school.

The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers.  Hint: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator.

To do this, we can subtract 309y from both sides. 339y - 309y = 309y - 570 - 309y This simplifies to: 30y = -570 Step 2: Solve for y Now we need to solve for y. To do this, we will divide both sides by 30. 30y / 30 = -570 / 30 This simplifies to: y = -19 So the solution to the equation 339y = 309y - 570 is y = -19."},{"instruction":"Q:I can use this background: The Hawaiian Islands ( Figure above ) are in the central Pacific Ocean.

A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery. Can we draw the following conclusion? Hooper is a citizen of Portland.","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that Hooper is a citizen of Portland. The statement mentions that the individual named Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery. However, this information alone is not sufficient to determine Hooper's citizenship. There are several reasons why this information does not provide a definitive conclusion about Hooper's citizenship: 1. Hooper's work routine: The fact that Hooper travels between Portland and Kittery for work does not necessarily imply that they reside in either of these locations. It is possible that they live in a nearby town or city within commuting distance or even that they travel extensively for work from a completely different location. Additionally, their place of residence may have changed over time, and their current residence may not be the same as when they worked for the company. 2. Company location: The location of the company where David Vance, the former employee who provided the information, and Hooper worked is not specified. If the company were located in Portland, it could potentially provide a stronger indication of Hooper's citizenship, but we still would not be able to conclude this without further evidence. 3. Citizenship vs. residence: Even if Hooper were a resident of Portland, it would not necessarily mean that they are a citizen. Citizenship generally refers to the legal status of a person, while residence refers to the physical location where someone lives. It is possible to be a resident of a city or town without being a citizen of the country in which it is located or vice versa. In summary, while the information provided gives us some insight into Hooper's work-related activities in the Portland and Kittery region, it does not provide enough evidence to definitively conclude that Hooper is a citizen of Portland. To arrive at a more accurate conclusion, additional information such as their place of residence, the location of the company they worked for, or their specific citizenship status would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To start advancing toward level nine, tap on \\"goals\\" and complete the list of required goals, such as feeding your monsters or buying breeding structures for islands. Verify that a breeding structure exists on cold island or shugabush island. Breeding a Deedge in My Singing Monsters is possible once you have achieved level nine in the game. This means you need to focus on leveling up and accomplishing the goals provided within the game. As you progress in My Singing Monsters, various in-game tasks will help you to level up more quickly. These tasks can involve feeding your monsters, purchasing or upgrading structures, and expanding your islands. Once you have reached level nine, ensure that a breeding structure is available on either Cold Island or Shugabush Island. These are the two islands where the Deedge monster can be bred. Monsters in My Singing Monsters are element-based, and the Deedge is composed of the Cold, Earth, Water, and Plant elements. You need to have two monsters with the appropriate combined elements in order to breed a Deedge. To breed a Deedge, go to the breeding structure on Cold Island or Shugabush Island and choose the two monsters you will use to breed the Deedge. Select a monster with Cold and Earth elements, and another with Water and Plant elements. For example, you could breed a Thumpies (Cold and Earth elements) with a Shellbeat (Water and Plant elements). The breeding process will take some time to complete, so be patient. Once the breeding is finished, you will have the possibility to hatch your newly-bred Deedge into an incubator. After the incubation period is over, you can collect your Deedge and add it to your collection of singing monsters. In conclusion, reaching level nine and having the appropriate breeding structures on Cold Island or Shugabush Island are the main prerequisites to breed a Deedge in My Singing Monsters. Once these conditions are met, you can combine the elements of Cold, Earth, Water, and Plant through monsters with complementary elements to successfully breed a Deedge.

I have a new situation: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  But I can use this background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  What is an answer for this question: Which would be a better day for group B to attack group A, battle day one or battle day two? A:","output":"Based on the provided information about temperature and nest openings, the better day for group B to attack group A would be on battle day two. On battle day one, the temperature in group A's territory was 5 °C, which is well below the range of 20-30 °C when Acromyrmex heyeri ants create more openings in the nest thatch for temperature regulation. Therefore, it is likely that group A's nest had fewer openings on battle day one, making it more difficult for group B to attack. On battle day two, the temperature in group A's territory was 22 °C, falling within the range where the ants create more openings in the nest thatch due to the increased internal nest temperature. This means group A's nest likely had more openings on battle day two, making it easier for group B to find weak points and attack group A. As a result, group B should choose to attack group A on battle day two when there are likely more openings in the nest thatch."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Revisiting these issues tried the patience of some of the officials who felt they had already been down these roads and who found the NSC's procedures slow.\\" We weren't going fast enough,\\"Armitage told us. Clarke kept arguing that moves against the Taliban and al Qaeda should not have to wait months for a larger review of U.S. policy in South Asia.\\" For the government,\\" Hadley said to us,\\"we moved it along as fast as we could move it along.\\" As all hope in moving the Taliban faded, debate revived about giving covert assistance to the regime's opponents. Clarke and the CIA's Cofer Black renewed the push to aid the Northern Alliance. Clarke suggested starting with modest aid, just enough to keep the Northern Alliance in the fight and tie down al Qaeda terrorists, without aiming to overthrow the Taliban. Rice, Hadley, and the NSC staff member for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, told us they opposed giving aid to the Northern Alliance alone. They argued that the program needed to have a big part for Pashtun opponents of theTaliban. They also thought the program should be conducted on a larger scale than had been suggested. Clarke concurred with the idea of a larger program, but he warned that delay risked the Northern Alliance's final defeat at the hands of the Taliban. During the spring, the CIA, at the NSC's request, had developed draft legal authorities-a presidential finding-to undertake a large-scale program of covert assistance to the Taliban's foes.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who thought the program should be larger?\\" is \\"Hadley\\"?","output":"Yes, sweetie, the correct answer is \\"Hadley.\\" Hadley, along with Rice and Khalilzad, thought that the program should be conducted on a larger scale than suggested.

Article: Eminent domain is the power of the state to take private property away from someone for use by the state for the public good. It is the enemy of libertarians everywhere and presumably Ron Swanson from \\"Parks and Recreation,\\" their most visible media avatar. And Seattle decided it needed to exercise this power over a 103-year-old woman, Myrtle Woldson. The city council voted to seize her parking lot, so they can turn it into ... a parking lot. The property owner plans to bequeath the lot to a charitable group when she passes, and some are speculating that the city's hidden agenda is to use eminent domain to purchase the waterfront lot at its current, cheaper price (it's valued at 7 million) compared to in a few years when the Seattle waterfront area is redeveloped. Woldson can still challenge the ruling in court. [Source]      See today's most shared stories on Facebook. ||||| SEATTLE — The city is forcing a 103-year-old Spokane woman to sell her parking lot in Seattle to make way for, well, a parking lot.      The Seattle City Council voted Monday to take the lot near the waterfront by eminent domain, using a portion of the 30 million provided by the state to take care of parking issues around the waterfront. Hundreds of public parking spaces will be lost when the state begins dismantling the Alaskan Way Viaduct for the digging of the tunnel. The construction will last until 2020.      The lot is owned by Spokane resident Myrtle Woldson. She doesn’t want to sell, so the City Council voted unanimously to use it’s power of eminent domain to take it after paying Woldson “fair market value.”      None of the City Council members would speak about their vote, but property rights advocates call it ridiculous.      “In this case, the city of Seattle is using eminent domain to seize a parking lot, so they can use it as a parking lot,” said Glen Morgan of the Freedom Foundation, which is an Olympia-based, conservative, free-market think tank. “There’s no public good in that at all.”      Morgan said there are several bills in the Legislature that would revamp eminent domain and give Washington property owners more rights.      “Eminent domain was originally intended for stuff like roadways, expanding roads, schools,” said Morgan. “Situations that are for the public good.”      Woldson can still challenge the move in court. She can also challenge the eventual selling price that the city decides on. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The Seattle City Council voted to use eminent domain to seize a parking lot owned by 103-year-old Myrtle Woldson, in order to turn it into a public parking lot.

The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrics encourage the listener to imagine a world at peace without the barriers of borders or the divisions of religion and nationality and to consider the possibility that the whole of humanity would live unattached to material possessions. Shortly before his death, Lennon said that much of the song's \\"lyric and content\\" came from his wife Yoko Ono, and in 2017, she received a co-writing credit.Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and album of the same name with Phil Spector. Recording began at Lennon's home studio at Tittenhurst Park, England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the Record Plant, in New York City, during July. One month after the September release of the LP, Lennon released \\"Imagine\\" as a single in the United States; the song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and the LP reached number one on the UK chart in November, later becoming the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career. Although not originally released as a single in the United Kingdom, it was released in 1975 to promote Shaved Fish, a compilation LP and it reached number six on the chart that year. The photograph on the cover was taken by May Pang in 1974. The song has since sold more than 1.6 million copies in the UK; it reached number one following Lennon's murder in December 1980.

While he is shooting, shy student Sam Merrick picks up the camera to take a look. Defensive and angry, George beats Sam up. Sam confides in both his protective older brother Rocky and his budding girlfriend, Millie, who urges Sam to take a higher road.Sam's older brother Rocky confides in his friends, Clyde and Marty, who are also familiar with George's reputation as a bully (he previously mocked Clyde for having two gay dads). While they agree that they need to stand up for Sam, they have different approaches. Clyde, who is sensitive and a bit of an outsider himself within the group, is more sympathetic and passive. Marty, who has issues with anger and trauma stemming from his father's suicide, his mother's apathy and his older brother's abuse, favors a more righteous form of revenge.Eventually, they hatch a plan with Sam to invite George on a fake birthday party for Sam, which George all-too eagerly accepts. They plan to drive to a local creek where they will spend the afternoon on a boat and, in an orchestrated game of Truth or Dare, get George to strip his clothes and jump in the lake, leading him to hitch a ride home in the nude.When the gang consisting of Sam, Rocky, Marty, Clyde and Millie (who is not yet aware of the plan) arrive at George's house, he is working on his video diary for the day.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25.

Please answer the following question: Question: What happens when you take a shower after going for a run? Options: - feeling refreshed - becoming tired - restlessness - leg cramps - sweating  Explain why a human would choose \\"feeling refreshed\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"When a human chooses \\"feeling refreshed\\" as the answer to the question regarding what happens when you take a shower after going for a run, it is because taking a shower after a physical activity, like running, provides multiple benefits that contribute to an overall feeling of refreshment. This response encompasses several physiological and psychological aspects, which will be discussed in detail below. 1. Temperature regulation: Running raises the body's core temperature due to increased physical exertion. Sweating is one method the body utilizes to dissipate heat and maintain a safe internal temperature. A shower after running can help lower the body's core temperature, especially when using cool or lukewarm water. This rapid decline in body heat promotes a feeling of refreshment. 2. Cleansing and hygiene: During a run, the body produces sweat, which can mix with dirt, oils, and bacteria on the skin's surface, potentially causing skin irritation or breakouts. Taking a shower helps cleanse the skin, removing sweat, dirt, and bacteria. This leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean, contributing to the overall refreshed sensation. 3. Relaxation and stress relief: Running can release endorphins, which naturally reduce stress and promote feelings of wellbeing. A shower also provides a relaxing experience, as the warm water can soothe aching muscles and the calming environment helps to clear the mind. Combining these two activities can amplify the sense of relaxation and rejuvenation, leading to a more refreshed state. 4. Muscle recovery: A post-run shower can also aid in muscle recovery. Warm or hot water can help increase blood flow to the muscles, which can alleviate muscle tension and reduce feelings of soreness and stiffness. Additionally, contrast showers, where one alternates between hot and cold water, can help reduce inflammation in the muscles and speed up recovery after exercise, further contributing to feeling refreshed. 5. Mental association: Many people have developed a habit or routine of taking a shower after physical exercise. This repetition has formed a strong mental association between showers and the end of the workout, signifying a transition from a state of exertion to relaxation. Thus, taking a shower after a run serves as a powerful psychological cue that the body is shifting towards a state of refreshment and rejuvenation. In summary, the choice of \\"feeling refreshed\\" as the answer to the question stems from various physiological and psychological factors associated with taking a shower after a run. These aspects include temperature regulation, cleansing and hygiene, relaxation and stress relief, muscle recovery, and mental association. Combined, they contribute to an overall sense of well-being and refreshment, making this an ideal response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

That is, until two strangers threw her into their car and sped away. It seemed like a bad dream. I could barely whisper when the police questioned me. For hours we waited,but there was no word on the whereabouts of the car. Tears would start to come. Then nothing.

Article: Long after its introduction into the New World, American English was still considered non-standard English. According to some people of the 1780s American English was a peasant's language that a \\"gentleman\\" will not speak. Considered in a bilingual point of view, British English was the dominant language linked to prestige and language purism . The belief in the authority or say in the superior of British English, has remained to the twentieth century, especially in the former British Empire or in the fields of British influence. Thus, it is reported that in prefix = st1 /China, teachers and school textbooks refer to and recommend Received Pronunciation as the model, as well as standard British sentence structures, spelling and words. British English is also encouraged and accepted as the criteria of some major official examinations, for example, College English Test and Test for English Majors which are conducted by government. Similar situations could be found in countries, for example, in Africa, the West African Examination Council and Joint Admission accepts the British English as the standard English. Report can also be found that inCairosome university students received lower grades if they used American spellings instead of British English. In Europe, we find teachers, British people as well as natives of the country in which they work, who follow the British English standard, and laugh at the American English. However, the above attitudes are nothing but the last influence of a long-gone period of British supermacy . The beginning of a clear lead of American English can be traced to the decades after World War II. This coincides with the simultaneous  rise of the US as a military and technological power and the decline of the British Empire, which drove many to American English. And from then on, American English has continuously sent its influence to every corner of the planet.

It then traces the shift in attitude towards American English and its rise to prominence, coinciding with the rise of the United States as a global power and the decline of the British Empire after World War II.

Background: Odom was born in South Jamaica, Queens, New York City, to Joe Odom and Cathy Mercer. His father was a heroin addict, and Odom's mother died of colon cancer when he was twelve years old. At her deathbed, Odom's mom told him: \\"Be nice to everybody\\". Afterwards, he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer. Context: On December 11, 2011, Odom was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the defending NBA champions, for a first-round draft pick and an 8.9 million trade exception after NBA Commissioner David Stern vetoed a proposed three-team trade that would have sent Odom and Houston Rockets teammates Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, and Goran Dragic to the New Orleans Hornets; Chris Paul to the Lakers; and Pau Gasol to the Houston Rockets. Odom felt \\"disrespected\\" after he learned of the Hornets trade publicly, and he requested a trade from the Lakers to another contending team. The Lakers were also concerned that Odom's contract was pricey since he was not needed to initiate the triangle offense with Mike Brown replacing Phil Jackson as Lakers coach.  In January 2012, Sports Illustrated reported that \\"Odom [had] yet to find his niche in Dallas. His struggles [made] him a frequent target of [Mavericks coach Rick] Carlisle, who [harped] on Odom's need to understand the coverages, be more alert, communicate and get in better shape... Team sources say Odom...appeared stressed by what they believe [was] the mental burden of an overwhelming offseason.\\" On March 2, 2012, Odom was assigned to the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. He had missed the prior three games due to personal reasons. His stint with the Legends was canceled on March 3, 2012, and he returned to the Mavs' active roster. On March 24, Odom did not play in a 104-87 loss to the San Antonio Spurs; this was the first time he could remember not playing due to a coach's decision.  On April 9, 2012, it was announced that Odom had parted ways with the Mavericks. Instead of releasing him, the team listed Odom as inactive for the remainder of the season. The move allowed the Mavericks to trade him at the end of the season. In a statement to ESPN, Odom said, \\"I'm sorry that things didn't work out better for both of us, but I wish the Mavs' organization, my teammates and Dallas fans nothing but continued success in the defense of their championship.\\" Mavericks owner Mark Cuban admitted that a clash between the two during halftime in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies on April 7 was the last straw. Odom reportedly responded angrily when Cuban questioned his commitment, asking if he was \\"in or out.\\" Odom averaged only 6.6 points in 20.5 minutes along with career lows in shooting percentage (35.2), rebounds (4.2) and assists (1.7) .

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Horslips are an Irish Celtic rock band that compose, arrange and perform songs frequently inspired by traditional Irish airs, jigs and reels. The group are regarded as 'founding fathers of Celtic rock' for their fusion of traditional Irish music with rock music and went on to inspire many local and international acts. They formed in 1970 and 'retired' in 1980 for an extended period. The name originated from a spoonerism on The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse which became \\"The Four Poxmen of The Horslypse\\". In March 2004, three Horslips enthusiasts, Jim Nelis, Stephen Ferris and Paul Callaghan, put on an exhibition of Horslips memorabilia in The Orchard Gallery in Derry. It was opened by the band, who played five songs acoustically. Buoyed by this first public appearance in 24 years, Horslips returned to the studio in Westmeath to produce a studio album, Roll Back, in the summer of 2004. Described as \\"Horslips Unplugged\\", the album contained acoustic reworkings of many of their best-known songs.  The same exhibition moved to Drogheda in October 2005, courtesy of longtime fan Paddy Goodwin, and was formally opened on 6 October by a tribute band, Horslypse, composed of nine teenage musicians. Horslips did a version of \\"Furniture\\". The exhibition moved to Belfast in February and March 2006 and there were plans for a New York showing in 2007. In February 2008, the exhibition opened in Ballinamore in County Leitrim, and in July it opened in Ballybofey in Donegal.  A double DVD entitled Return of the Dancehall Sweethearts came out in November 2005. Disc one is a documentary and disc two was live footage of the band from the 1970s, including promo videos and slots on The Old Grey Whistle Test.  In December 2005, the band played in front of an invited audience for the recording of the RTE television program Other Voices in Dingle in County Kerry. Part of the set included three songs done \\"full-on\\" - the first time the band had played live and electric since October 1980.  The last Horslips' event in this phase of their career was a TG4 tribute show recorded and broadcast live on 25 March 2006 before a live invited studio audience. A number of Irish personalities were interviewed, in Irish, about what the band meant to them and how Horslips shaped modern Irish music. What happened with the return?","output":"The return of Horslips began with an exhibition of their memorabilia in The Orchard Gallery, Derry, in March 2004, organized by three enthusiasts - Jim Nelis, Stephen Ferris, and Paul Callaghan.

This encouraged them to produce an album, Roll Back, in summer 2004, which featured acoustic reworkings of their popular songs. The exhibition traveled to various locations including Drogheda, Belfast, Ballinamore in County Leitrim, and Ballybofey in Donegal, with plans to showcase it in New York in 2007. In November 2005, a double DVD titled \\"Return of the Dancehall Sweethearts\\" was released, which included a documentary and live footage from the 1970s. In December 2005, Horslips played a live and electric set for the first time since 1980, as part of the RTE television program Other Voices in Dingle, County Kerry. The last Horslips' event during this phase of their career was a TG4 tribute show recorded and broadcast live on 25 March 2006 before a live invited studio audience. Various Irish personalities, speaking in Irish, discussed the band's influence and their role in shaping modern Irish music. Overall, the return of Horslips revived their presence in the music scene and showcased their enduring impact on Irish music through exhibitions, DVD releases, acoustic performances, and television appearances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the first name of the person who was only fourteen when wed?  At the court in Ferrara, a collection of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to the court in 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers. The Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by Alfonso in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court. According to Grana, a contemporary correspondent, \\"Signora Machiavella [Lucrezia], Signora Isabella, and Signora Vittoria have abandoned the field, having lost the backing of Luzzaschi\\". The first recorded performance by the professional ladies was on November 20, 1580; by carnival season in 1581, they were performing together regularly.This new \\"consort of ladies\\" was viewed as an extraordinary and novel phenomenon; most witnesses did not connect the second period of the concerto delle donne with the group of ladies who sang in...

Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Given the task definition and input, reply with output. This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Passage: The word qurʼān appears about 70 times in the Quran itself, assuming various meanings. It is a verbal noun (maṣdar) of the Arabic verb qaraʼa (قرأ), meaning \\"he read\\" or \\"he recited\\". The Syriac equivalent is (ܩܪܝܢܐ) qeryānā, which refers to \\"scripture reading\\" or \\"lesson\\". While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the origin of the word is qaraʼa itself. Regardless, it had become an Arabic term by Muhammad's lifetime. An important meaning of the word is the \\"act of reciting\\", as reflected in an early Quranic passage: \\"It is for Us to collect it and to recite it (qurʼānahu).\\"","output":"Part #1: Create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: What is the minimum age requirement to recite the Quran? This question meets the criteria because there is no mention of age constraints in the given passage. Part #2: Create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. Usage: Which famous historical figure was known for their ability to recite the Quran beautifully? This question requires information beyond the passage, as no historical figure is mentioned in the context. Part #3: Replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date and use it in the question. Usage: The word qurʼān appears about 100 times in the Quran itself, what can be inferred about its significance? This meets the criteria because the actual number mentioned in the passage is 70 times, not 100. Part #4: Create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Usage: Is the primary meaning of the word qurʼān the \\"act of writing\\"? This question meets the criteria because the passage states that an important meaning of the word is the \\"act of reciting\\", not writing. This question is created by replacing \\"reciting\\" with its antonym \\"writing\\"."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

(CNN) -- A Canadian Forces crew calmly plucked a terrified crane operator trapped by a smoke-spewing fire in Kingston, Ontario. The Tuesday rescue was captured by television cameras and bystanders and posted to social media. The operator had moved from the cab of his crane to its very tip to escape flames and smoke from a building fire that broke out below him Tuesday, and bystanders captured the rescue in a series of images posted to social media. \\"At first he was petrified, he didn't want to let go of the crane,\\" rescue helicopter commander Capt. David Agnew told CNN affiliate CTV of the crane operator. The crane remained standing Wednesday,","output":"its charred and blackened support beams a stark reminder of the harrowing incident that unfolded just a day earlier. Officials are now investigating the cause of the fire that led to the dramatic rescue, while praising the quick and efficient response from the Canadian Forces crew. As the fire rapidly spread through the construction site, it became apparent that traditional rescue efforts would not be possible. Instead, the rescuers had to devise an unconventional plan to save the trapped operator. The most logical approach was to use a helicopter for the rescue, given the height of the crane and the difficulty in accessing the stranded worker. Navigating a helicopter into position near the crane requires immense skill and precision, especially given the gusts of smoke and potential debris from the fire. The pilot and crew members were able to successfully position the helicopter close enough for the terrified crane operator to climb aboard, a feat that underscores their expertise and training. Once onboard, the crane operator was given medical care and emotional support to help him recover from the traumatic experience. Authorities are now looking into possible safety measures that can be put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, ensuring that construction workers are better equipped to handle emergencies. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage is to provide a contextual summary of the rescue efforts and an outline of the ensuing investigation, with a focus on the vital role played by the Canadian Forces crew. This serves to highlight both the heroism of the rescuers and the importance of effective emergency protocols in ensuring the safety of those working in dangerous conditions."},{"instruction":"Article: The drug store was closing for the night.

The concept refers to the process of sharing and acquiring knowledge, skills, and expertise between individuals, groups, organizations, and systems to enhance the overall performance and efficiency in these domains. Human resources play a critical role in ensuring the success and growth of organizations. Proper management of human resources requires constant adaptation and integration of new knowledge and skills. This can be achieved through various means, such as training programs, workshops, seminars, and on-the-job experiences. In this era of rapid technological advancements, the role of science and technology in shaping human resources management is even more crucial. It is essential to equip employees with the latest knowledge and tools to keep up with the ever-evolving landscape of technological innovations. In the context of science and technology, integrated knowledge transfers involve not only the sharing of technical knowledge and skills but also the understanding of the broader societal and environmental implications of these advancements. This includes, for example, the ethical considerations regarding the use of certain technologies as well as the potential environmental impact of various technological processes. By focusing on integrated knowledge transfers in these domains, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners can work together to ensure that scientific and technological progress benefits all members of society. There are numerous strategies and approaches to facilitating integrated knowledge transfers in human resources and science and technology. Some of these include: 1. Collaborative research and development: This involves partnerships between academia, industry, and government entities to work on collaborative projects that address specific challenges or develop new technologies. 2. Open innovation: This approach encourages organizations to tap into external sources of knowledge and expertise, such as academia or other industries, to strengthen their internal capabilities and promote a culture of continuous learning. 3. Knowledge networks and communities of practice: These allow individuals to share experiences, best practices, and lessons learned with their peers, promoting a culture that values knowledge transfer and collaboration. 4. Internships, apprenticeships, and exchange programs: These opportunities enable individuals to gain practical experience and develop professional networks, facilitating the flow of knowledge and expertise between organizations. 5. Conferences, workshops, and seminars: Such events bring together professionals from diverse fields to share their knowledge, foster collaboration, and inspire new ideas. 6. E-learning and online resources: Digital platforms and tools can provide accessible and up-to-date educational resources for individuals to develop their skills and knowledge. By supporting and implementing these strategies, organizations can ensure that they effectively transfer knowledge between their employees, networks, and stakeholders in the fields of human resources and science and technology.

Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game.

The ship, which is carrying 1500 passenger, was sailing around  Fiordland National Park when the virus was detected and is currently on-route to Melbourne. The ship is on a 13-day cruise around New Zealand and is returning to Melbourne today, which will be it's last stop. 200 passengers on-board the Dawn Princess cruise ship have been confined to their cabins after an outbreak of the norovirus struck the ship while it was travelling around New Zealand. The norovirus is a gastrointestinal illness, which typically lasts one to three days. It causes stomach pain, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. The virus can be contracted by food contamination, person-to-person contact or by the contamination of surfaces. Local authorities in New Zealand carried out tests on-board and confirmed that it was an outbreak of the highly contagious virus. In a statement, a Princess Cruises spokesman said that most passengers on the cruise have been unaffected by the bug and that it is under control. 'Some passengers on Dawn Princess' current cruise to New Zealand destinations reported gastrointestinal symptoms confirmed as norovirus, commonly referred to in the community as a 'stomach bug'.' the spokesman said. The norovirus is a gastrointestinal illness, which typically lasts one to three days.It causes stomach pain, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. 'It takes relatively few cases to be reported on-board for even more stringent sanitation levels to be implemented. 'The containment response was timely and effective and the number of new cases has declined significantly.' He said that every effort has been made to limit any new cases of the bug. Staff have been disinfecting surfaces such as rails, door handles and elevator buttons,. The ship, which is carrying 1500 passenger, was sailing around Fiordland National Park when the virus was detected and is currently on-route to Melbourne. He also confirmed that infected passengers have been confined to their cabins, until they can be deemed non-contagious. Passengers have been urged to use their private toilet facilities and use sanitising gels located throughout the ship. All self-service in food areas has been closed off on the ship. Dr Alistair Humphrey, Canterbury Medical Officer of Health told the New Zealand Herald that the Dawn Princess was confident it could contain the bug and has it's own doctor on-board. 'The number of cases is declining. They're still seeing a few coming in but not as many,' Dr Humphrey said. 'They stand at a little over 200 people altogether.' According to other news outlets, a Dunedin tour operator has slammed the crew of the Dawn Princess for failing to reveal the true extent of the virus. According to the operator, they only learnt about the quarantine of passengers after it was reported on social media. Local authorities in New Zealand carried out tests on-board and confirmed that it was an outbreak of the highly contagious virus. Dr Humphreys said it may take days for a person's symptoms to become obvious and supported the isolation of infected passengers. 'Generally speaking [patients] are most infectious when they're symptomatic, which is why it's important to keep people isolated in their cabins...' he said. The latest outbreak is the second norovirus outbreak on the Dawn Princess this year alone, with a 75 day cruise through Asia and Alaska also affected. A similar outbreak of the strain also occurred on the ship two years ago. 114 passengers and 11 crew fell ill. The ship has a guest capacity of 1,999 and was last refurbished in June 2009.","output":"So there is this big boat called the Dawn Princess, and it was on a fun cruise with lots of people around New Zealand.

Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin.

Context: The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.  Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" Question: After the amendment, Wessler probably is Options:  A. indifferent  B. not enough information  C. in favor of the warrant  D. against the warrant Answer:","output":"C. in favor of the warrant"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.  John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B.

April is believed dead after being crushed by the wreckage of the space shuttle.

Article: IMAGINE if, to collect your salary each month, you had to walk to the nearest town, perhaps tens of miles away, to gather in a school or a football court or a church. There, you and your colleagues wait for a man to arrive from the capital, perhaps a thousand miles away, with a suitcase of cash. Few countries are as corrupt as Congo . Mobutu Sese Seko, a former strongman, used state funds to _ a Concorde to take him on shopping trips to Paris. By the time of his overthrow in 1997, graft was endemic. Government employees were not paid but rather expected to use their positions to make a living. Among the most prized government jobs was that of accountant: the people responsible for transporting bags of cash to the provinces to hand out to employees. In 2012, however, the Congolese government started helping civil servants to open bank accounts. Around three-quarters of them--some 670,000 people--now have one. In the process, the government has weeded out tens of thousands of ghost employees, since the embezzlers who invented them could not open accounts in their names without a matching ID. Yet in a vast country with fewer roads than Luxembourg, hardly anyone lives anywhere near a bank branch. So Congolese banks must now do the work the government accountants used to: shipping money to the remote area. Cash has to be transported to branches in regional capitals, and thence to account-holders on the backs of motorbikes, in canoes or by foot. Bank staff with suitcases of cash make easy targets, just as they did in the west of America in the 19th century. Though they usually travel with armed policemen, there have been at least ten armed robberies of bank employees since January. At the moment banks are little more than money-transfer companies, and not very sophisticated ones at that. The transfers tend to go only one way--out of Kinshasa--so cannot be netted against each other; instead cash almost always has to be moved physically. Therefore, most Congolese bankers hope that the new system will promote the... Question: How did government employees use to earn a living?

The couple's bodies were found at Mr Snell's home in Cringleford, Norfolk, on 31 October 2009. Moody denied murder at Norwich Crown Court but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He will be sentenced on Friday. Moody and Ms Brown, who had been in a violent 12-year relationship which ended in 2008, used to run the sandwich shop Baguette Express near Norwich Market. Moody murdered Ms Brown and Mr Snell after being told of their relationship earlier that day, the court heard. The prosecution said their deaths were caused by \\"an angry and jealous man\\". But the defence urged jurors to accept Moody was suffering from an abnormality of the mind. The court heard that Moody \\"lost his self-control\\" and drove to Mr Snell's home armed with a hammer and knife. He smashed through the front door and attacked Ms Brown in the back garden with the weapons, while repeatedly shouting: \\"Why did you lie?\\" The jury was played recordings of the 999 calls made by Ms Brown and Mr Snell.

Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984. Paglia is critical of many aspects of modern culture, and is the author of Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson (1990) and other books. Paglia was born in Endicott, New York, the eldest child of Pasquale and Lydia Anne (nee Colapietro) Paglia. All four of her grandparents were born in Italy. Her mother immigrated to the United States at five years old from Ceccano, in the province of Frosinone, Lazio, Italy. Additionally, Paglia has stated that her father's side of the family were from the Campanian towns of Avellino, Benevento, and Caserta. Paglia attended primary school in rural Oxford, New York, where her family lived in a working farmhouse. Her father, a veteran of World War II, taught at the Oxford Academy high school, and exposed his young daughter to art through books he brought home about French art history. In 1957, her family moved to Syracuse, New York, so that her father could begin graduate school; he eventually became a professor of Romance languages at Le Moyne College. She attended the Edward Smith Elementary School, T. Aaron Levy Junior High and William Nottingham High School. In 1992 Carmelia Metosh, her Latin teacher for three years, said, \\"She always has been controversial. Whatever statements were being made (in class), she had to challenge them. She made good points then, as she does now.\\" Paglia thanked Metosh in the acknowledgements to Sexual Personae, later describing her as \\"the dragon lady of Latin studies, who breathed fire at principals and school boards\\".  She took a variety of names when she was at Spruce Ridge Camp, including Anastasia (her confirmation name, inspired by the film Anastasia starring Ingrid Bergman), Stacy, and Stanley. A crucially significant event for her was when an outhouse exploded after she poured too much lime into the latrine. \\"That symbolized everything I would do with my life and work. Excess and extravagance and explosiveness. I would be someone who would look into the latrine of culture, into pornography and crime and psychopathology... and I would drop the bomb into it\\".  For more than a decade, Paglia was the partner of artist Alison Maddex. Paglia legally adopted Maddex's son (who was born in 2002). In 2007 the couple separated but remained \\"harmonious co-parents,\\" in Paglia's words, who lived two miles apart.  Paglia has claimed to identify as transgender and stated that she has \\"never identified at all with being a woman\\".

Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson).

Movie plot title: Hercules Movie plot: Amphitryon and his men are transporting a Cretan criminal named Antaeus by ship. Amphitryon worships Zeus, and mocks his prisoner for worshiping Hera by scarring his arm with a lightning bolt symbol. Antaeus breaks free and jumps overboard. Alcmene, Amphitryon's wife, is High Priestess of the Harvest Festival, a yearly ritual devoted to Hera, which involves the human sacrifice of a male. After it is discovered that the intended victim, Tiresias, is a hermaphrodite, the priestesses decide to release him, but gouge out his eyes. On her way home, Alcmene is assaulted and raped by a large man, his face not visible in the darkness. The crime is witnessed by a lyre player, Linus, who declares the culprit to be Zeus, due to the lightning symbol on his arm. Amphitryon arrives home, comforts his wife, and makes love to her. Alcmene becomes pregnant. Alcmene gives birth to fraternal twin sons. She believes this will make her heir to the House of Perseus in Thebes, but is informed that her uncle already had a son, Eurystheus, who will be the heir. She visits the Harpies, to determine which child belongs to Amphitryon and which belongs to Zeus. One harpie attempts to nurse one baby, who bites her. The Harpies declare him Son of Zeus, name him \\"Hercules --glory to Hera\\", and order Alcmene to kill him, departing afterward. Alcmene names the other son, Iphicles, and begs Amphitryon to kill Hercules. Her husband cannot bring himself to do it, so Alcmene sends two snakes into Hercules' crib. The baby picks them up and squeezes them to death. As a teenager, Hercules is very headstrong, foolish, and prideful. He is constantly ridiculed and disdained by his mother, brother, and King Eurystheus. He develops an unrequited crush on Alcmene's protÃ©gÃ©, Megara, who refuses to associate with him because she worships Hera. While being tutored by Linus, Hercules loses his temper and strikes Linus in the head, knocking him out. Everyone mistakenly believes he is dead, so they exile Hercules to the mountains.

These teams consist of highly experienced professionals from a variety of backgrounds who can provide day-to-day individualized treatment and support for living with schizophrenia. Your team might consist of psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, pharmacists, counselors, social workers, and occupational therapists. Receiving support from your loved ones is critical to your ability to manage schizophrenia. Include your family and friends in doctor visits, ACT team meetings, therapy sessions, and support groups. Encourage them to ask your treatment team any questions they need to better support you. You might also make special requests as to how your loved ones can support you. These may include helping you spot early warning signs, helping you remember your medications, accompanying you to appointments, and helping you relearn skills to function in everyday life. Being diagnosed with schizophrenia can make you feel isolated and misunderstood. That’s why it’s a great idea to connect with other people who are living with the condition. Self-help and support groups are designed to help you build relationships with others with schizophrenia.  In support groups, you might discuss helpful coping strategies, get education about managing schizophrenia, and share stories about what’s it like living with the disorder. Ask your doctor or therapist about schizophrenia support groups in your area. Ask your community mental health team or support group about how you can receive social skills training. These behavioral interventions can help you better function in the community and feel more capable of managing schizophrenia. Social skills training can improve your quality of life by helping you behave appropriately in social situations, solve problems, communicate more effectively with those around you, and deal with everyday life stress. Doing meaningful work in your community can also help improve your quality of life with schizophrenia. Consider getting vocational training to help you develop transferrable skills, look for a job that suits your lifestyle and condition, and learn how to manage your money.

Here is a question about this article: Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of mid-rise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate 610 west. Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, 901-foot (275 m)-tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside of a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, there was a mini-boom of mid-rise and high-rise residential tower construction, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 more than 30 high-rise buildings have gone up in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units.

Write highlights for this article: Jon Krakauer will release Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town on April 21. For his next book, Jon Krakauer looked into a series of campus rapes at the University of Montana after he learned that a close family friend had been raped by a man she trusted. Mr Krakauer announced Monday that he would release 'Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town' on April 21. The best-selling author says that the story 'makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault'. He has previously written narrative non-fiction about topical issues, including a biography of football player and soldier Pat Tillman. The book's release in April follows several years where sexual assaults and how they are handled by universities have gotten increased attention. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012, according to Mr Krakauer's website. The Colorado-based journalist says the new book 'chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula' with both the police system and their university. The book purportedly tells how one district attorney testified for an alleged rapist during university proceedings against him. She later left the prosecutor's office, becoming an attorney for the university's star football player who was accused on rape. The Department of Justice began an investigation into Missoula County in May 2012 after receiving complaints about the way officials handled rapes reported by University of Montana students. A June 2014 agreement ended the investigation, with the county agreeing to training and special prosecutors for sexual assault cases. The university itself has created a small sexual assault prevention department last year with a coordinator and three interns, according to the Montana Kaimin. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012. While Mr Krakauer's story focuses on Montana, the book's scope is more global. Missoula is described as 'a typical college town' and Mr Krakauer's website said that rape victims are 'deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken'. Mr Krakauer decided to write the book 'after learning that a young woman with whom he and his wife have a close relationship suffered intensely in secret for many years after she was raped by a man she trusted,' according to USA Today. Sexual assault and rape have become issues at campuses across the country, with victims speaking out against the way that universities dealt with their allegations. Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia University attended the State of the Union with New York Senator Kristen Gillbrand after carrying a mattress around to classes in protest against her alleged attacker's continued presence on campus. Mr Krakauer, pictured speaking in 2009, is the best selling author of works such as Into Thin Air and Into the Wild. President Obama sent a pre-recorded message to the Grammys on Sunday urging artists to advocate against sexual and domestic violence. Ninety-four colleges and universities were under investigation by the Department of Justice for their handling of sexual assault cases as of the beginning of this year. Mr Krakauer's book says that it 'cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape'. The writer's other works include Into the Wild, Under the Banner of Heaven and Into Thin Air, for which he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Publisher Doubleday plans a first printing of 500,000 copies for the new book.","output":"Author Jon Krakauer's new book, \\"Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town,\\" investigates a series of campus rapes at the University of Montana, shedding light on the prevalence of rape on American campuses, and the reluctancy of victims to report these incidents.

In May 2012, the Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police.

Article:Think tank British Future said the Brexit referendum outcome was a \\"vote of no confidence\\" in existing policies. It said public expectations of curbs on low-skilled migration must be met. The think tank has also released a survey suggesting almost half of Britons do not believe the government will reach its net migration targets. Ministers have pledged to reduce net migration to below 100,000 by 2020. British Future's report is published ahead of the release on Thursday of the latest net migration figures. Details of the number of people coming to the UK for more than a year from across the EU and the rest of the world will be published at 09:30 BST - covering the year to 31 March. Net migration - the difference between the estimated number of people settling in the UK and those emigrating - rose to 333,000 in 2015, the second highest figure on record, and has been above 300,000 for the past five quarters. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is sticking with her predecessor David Cameron's target of bringing the annual figure down to less than 100,000 - even though he fell well short of this during the last Parliament. Opposition parties and some Tories have called for the target to be ditched, arguing it is distorting priorities and will be unachievable even outside the EU. But ministers say it is still a valid benchmark for \\"sustainable\\" migration levels. In its report, British Future - which describes itself as a non-partisan body focused on addressing issues of migration, integration and identity - said the target was a \\"symbolic totem\\" for many and the failure to meet it had damaged public trust but it was unlikely to be reconsidered until the shape of the UK's Brexit deal became apparent. \\"After the referendum, the debate about the future of the headline target will have little practical impact until the contours of future UK immigration policy become clearer,\\" it wrote. \\"Nobody in government or outside of it could possibly be in a position to make a sensible long-term judgement about future immigration targets without knowing more about the Brexit deal itself, about prevailing conditions in the UK economy and their impact on inward and outward flows.\\" Instead, policymakers should focus on coming up with \\"workable alternatives\\" for presenting their objectives pending what it said should be a far-reaching review of immigration goals and a \\"national conversation\\" about future options. \\"Britain's current immigration system is broken and is not working for anybody,\\" it said. \\"Leaving the EU will have a major impact on almost all aspects of immigration policy. \\"While Brexit will present challenges for decision-makers, it also offers and opportunity to get policy right in this area and to help secure consent for the immigration that we have.\\" Meanwhile, British Future's survey of 2,400 people says 44% of those polled said the target was unlikely to be met in the next five years - even after Britain withdraws from the European Union. But 37% still thought the target was likely to be achieved. Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank, said: \\"Public trust in governments' competence to manage immigration - including meeting its own targets - is at rock bottom.\\" During the referendum, Leave campaigners said exiting the EU would allow the UK to determine who came into the country but mostly stopped short of saying greater controls would result in a fall in immigration. Brexit negotiations, which will not begin in earnest until the start of 2017 at the earliest, are likely to hinge on to what extent continued access to EU markets can be squared with limits on immigration from the EU. Thursday's report said it would be unacceptable for there to be no restrictions on the right of other EU citizens to come to live and work in the UK given the strong public support for this. And while the public broadly accepted the need for employers to be allowed to continue to recruit highly skilled migrants from across the world, it said, economic arguments for migration had fallen on deaf ears during the referendum and must be reconsidered - with more priority given to managing the consequent social pressures. As well as giving local authorities funding to mitigate the impact of immigration on public services, it said, more emphasis must be placed on helping integrate migrants in their new communities and bodies should be set up in all cities and regions with devolved mayors to coordinate approaches. Another think tank, the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research, said the net migration target should simply be abandoned in favour of separate targets for low-skilled and high-skilled immigration. \\"They say the definition of madness is repeating the same thing and expecting a different result,\\" its associate director Phoebe Griffith said. \\"Yet the government continue to stand by a net migration target that neither the public nor many ministers have confidence in. \\"Having a net migration target is like having a target for the number of sunny days in a year; it's not going to change the weather by itself. \\"The government need to design policy to balance public concerns with the needs of different sectors of our economy.\\" The IPPR's own research suggests there are currently about 55,000 EU nationals working in the English NHS, with one in 10 of the UK's registered doctors an EU national, and the health service would \\"collapse\\" without them. It said all EU nationals who work for, or as locums in, the NHS should be eligible to apply for British citizenship.

Q:Given the following passage  \\"The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties.

George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it.

Is my goal supposed to be buying my dream car(s)? Is my goal spiritual? I’m currently Catholic, but I’ve seen how spiritually those around me have changed. I’ve even wondered what’s the point of heaven, if everything I want is there. I like life because of the ups and the downs. I enjoy learning and discovering new things. The idea of perfection seems like an impossible concept to me. Maybe even an unenjoyable one. Maybe my goal is to have a family. Being catholic naturally we gravitate towards larger families. But as a libertarian I don’t see a lot of potential in the United States at it pertains to economic freedoms. I see the government encroaching more and more into our lives. Is this the type of country I want to raise a family in? I certainly don’t want to be outside the United States (no offense towards anyone outside of the U.S). Maybe my goal is political. I’ve always wanted to run for office. Maybe governor one day. Would I be able to avoid the waves of bipartisanship, and actually do what I believe is the best for the people of my state. Or would I collapse under the political pressures and sign up for agreements I know in my heart and mind won’t help the people. Only time will tell. I just don’t see a point. I actually have many goals, but I struggle to see the overall point of accomplishing any of it. Especially seeing as anything I do will be lost in the ink-blots of history.

For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and lime, though not native to Ireland, are also common there.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators.

The answer is:","output":"ii. yes. While the two sentences may have been constructed differently and employed slightly varying terminology, they ultimately convey the same meaning. To better understand the similarities in their implications, we must examine them more closely. Sentence 1: \\"The Fox Movie Channel has banned Charlie Chan.\\" This statement suggests that the Fox Movie Channel has decided to enact a ban or restriction on Charlie Chan. A ban can come in multiple forms, but in this context, it seems they are no longer allowing programs featuring Charlie Chan to be broadcasted on their network. This prohibition implies that the Fox Movie Channel has taken an active decision to exclude Charlie Chan from their programming lineup due to specific reasons. Sentence 2: \\"Charlie Chan is off the case for the Fox Movie Channel.\\" In this sentence, \\"off the case\\" is a metaphorical way of stating that the channel has excluded or removed Charlie Chan from its programming. This phrase is generally used when a detective or investigator has been taken off a case or assignment, but has been adapted here to fit the context of a movie channel's programming decisions. Both statements indicate that the Fox Movie Channel has made a conscious decision to exclude Charlie Chan from their network for one reason or another. Although the phrases \\"banned\\" and \\"off the case\\" may not be synonyms, they impart similar meanings when applied to this situation.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek  \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and  \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.  - Yale University is an American private Ivy League research university in New Haven, Connecticut. Founded in 1701 in Saybrook Colony to train Congregationalist ministers, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States.  - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - Drawing is a form of visual art in which a person uses various drawing instruments to mark paper or another two-dimensional medium.

The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - Collage (from the , \\"to glue\\") is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the visual arts, where the artwork is made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole.  - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States.

Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California.  - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.  - The decorative arts are arts or crafts concerned with the design and manufacture of beautiful objects that are also functional. It includes interior design, but not usually architecture. The decorative arts are often categorized in opposition to the \\"fine arts\\", namely, painting, drawing, photography, and large-scale sculpture, which generally have no function other than to be seen.  - Panama, officially called the Republic of Panama, is a country usually considered to be entirely in North America or Central America.

The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - A pastel is an art medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.  - The United States Capitol, often called the Capitol Building or Capitol Hill, is the home of the United States Congress, and the seat of the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government. It sits atop Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants.  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - Installation art is an artistic genre of three-dimensional works that often are site-specific and designed to transform the perception of a space. Generally, the term is applied to interior spaces, whereas exterior interventions are often called public art, land art or intervention art; however, the boundaries between these terms overlap.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all U.S. national parks, many American national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations. It was created on August 25, 1916, by Congress through the National Park Service Organic Act and is an agency of the United States Department of the Interior. The NPS is charged with a dual role of preserving the ecological and historical integrity of the places entrusted to its management while also making them available and accessible for public use and enjoyment.  - Constitution Gardens is a park area in Washington, D.C., United States, located within the boundaries of the National Mall. The park is bounded on the west by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, on the east by 17th St NW, on the north by Constitution Avenue, and on the south by the Reflecting Pool. Constitution Gardens has a small pond, which contains an island open to pedestrians.  - The Washington Monument is an obelisk on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., built to commemorate George Washington, once commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and the first American president. Located almost due east of the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial, the monument, made of marble, granite, and bluestone gneiss, is both the world's tallest stone structure (brick is not stone) and the world's tallest obelisk, standing tall according to the National Geodetic Survey (measured 201314) or tall according to the National Park Service (measured 1884).  In 1975, a ramp covered a step at the entrance to the monument, so the ground next to the ramp was raised to match its height, reducing the remaining height to the monument's apex. The obelisk was originally intended by its designer to stand tall, but questions regarding the design of the foundation caused the height to be set lower by the time the building was eventually completed. It is the tallest monumental column in the world if all are measured above their pedestrian entrances, but two are taller when measured above ground, though they are neither all stone nor true obelisks. The tallest masonry structure in the world is the Anaconda Smelter Stack in Montana at .  - Artists' books (or art books) are works of art that utilize the form of the book. They are often published in small editions, though they are sometimes produced as one-of-a-kind objects.  - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Contemporary art is art produced at the present period in time. Contemporary art includes, and develops from, postmodern art, which is itself a successor to modern art. In vernacular English, \\"modern\\" and \\"contemporary\\" are synonyms, resulting in some conflation of the terms \\"modern art\\" and \\"contemporary art\\" by non-specialists.  - Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art.  - The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden is an art museum beside the National Mall , in Washington , D.C. , the United States . The museum was initially endowed during the 1960s with the permanent art collection of Joseph H. Hirshhorn . It was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft and is part of the Smithsonian Institution . It was conceived as the United States ' museum of contemporary and modern art and currently focuses its collection - building and exhibition - planning mainly on the post -- World War II period , with particular emphasis on art made during the last 50 years . The Hirshhorn is sited exactly halfway between the Washington Monument and the US Capitol , anchoring the southernmost end of the so - called LEnfant axis ( perpendicular to the Mall 's green carpet ) . The National Archives / National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden across the Mall , and the National Portrait Gallery / Smithsonian American Art building several blocks to the north , also mark this pivotal axis , a key element of both the 1791 city plan by Pierre LEnfant and the 1901 MacMillan Plan . The building itself is an attraction , likened by some to a large spacecraft parked on the National Mall . The building is an open cylinder elevated on four massive \`\` legs , '' with a large fountain occupying the central courtyard . Before architect Gordon Bunshaft designed the building , the Smithsonian staff reportedly told him that , if it did not provide a striking contrast to everything else in the city , then it would be unfit for housing a modern art collection .  - The National Mall is a national park in downtown Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Mall, which is part of its National Mall and Memorial Parks unit. The term \\"National Mall\\" commonly includes areas that are officially part of West Potomac Park and Constitution Gardens to the west, and often is taken to refer to the entire area between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, with the Washington Monument dividing the area slightly west of its midpoint. A smaller designation, sometimes referred to as the \\"Mall proper\\", excludes both the Capitol grounds and the Washington Monument grounds, applying only to an area between them. The National Mall contains a number of museums and memorials and receives approximately 24 million visitors each year.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - Gordon Bunshaft, FAIA (May 9, 1909  August 6, 1990), was an American architect, a leading proponent of modern design in the mid-twentieth century. A partner in the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), Bunshaft joined in 1937 and remained for more than 40 years. The long list of his notable buildings includes Lever House in New York, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., the National Commercial Bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 140 Broadway (Marine Midland Grace Trust Co.) and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Branch Bank in New York; the last was the first post-war \\"transparent\\" bank on the East Coast.  - An art museum or art gallery is a building or space for the exhibition of art, usually visual art. Museums can be public or private, but what distinguishes a museum is the ownership of a collection. Paintings are the most commonly displayed art objects; however, sculptures, decorative arts, furniture, textiles, costumes, drawings, pastels, watercolors, collages, prints, artist's books, photographs, and installation art are also regularly shown. Although primarily concerned with providing a space to show works of visual art, art galleries are sometimes used to host other artistic activities, such as performance arts, music concerts, or poetry readings.  - The Smithsonian Institution, established in 1846 \\"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge,\\" is a group of museums and research centers administered by the Government of the United States. Originally organized as the \\"United States National Museum,\\" that name ceased to exist as an administrative entity in 1967. Termed \\"the nation's attic\\" for its eclectic holdings of 138 million items, the Institution's nineteen museums, nine research centers, and zoo include historical and architectural landmarks, mostly located in the District of Columbia.

The institution's annual budget is around 1.2 billion with 2/3 coming from annual federal appropriations. Other funding comes from the Institution's endowment, private and corporate contributions, membership dues, and earned retail, concession, and licensing revenue. Institution publications include \\"Smithsonian\\" and \\"Air & Space\\" magazines.  - The Lincoln Memorial is an American national monument built to honor the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. It is located on the western end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., across from the Washington Monument. The architect was Henry Bacon; the designer of the primary statue  \\"Abraham Lincoln\\", 1920  was Daniel Chester French; the Lincoln statue was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers; and the painter of the interior murals was Jules Guerin. Dedicated in 1922, it is one of several monuments built to honor an American president. It has always been a major tourist attraction and since the 1930s has been a symbolic center focused on race relations.  - Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure. Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client. Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries. Construction starts with planning, design, and financing; and continues until the project is built and ready for use.  - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - Performance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.

Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"what happens when animals and plants evolve to environmental conditions?\\" and the following answer choices:  - survival  - rapid expansion  - ascension  - extinction  - revolution  - adding heat  - Temperature changing  - specialization  Now knowing that specialization occurs when competing species evolve different adaptations and animals and plants evolve together, adapting to environmental conditions, choose the best answer. Answer:","output":"In responding to the question \\"what happens when animals and plants evolve to environmental conditions?\\", there are several potential answers, but the best suited to the situation would be 'specialization.' Here's a detailed explanation: Firstly, it's essential to understand what evolution means in the biological context. Evolution refers to the change in the characteristics of a species over several generations and relies on the process of natural selection. The natural and undeniable variation that occurs in every population means that some individuals have traits better suited to their environment than others. Those who are better adapted are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes.  In the context of animals and plants evolving to environmental conditions, 'specialization' is the keyword. It implies that over time, organisms evolve to become specially adapted to their environment. Being a 'specialist' species denotes possessing characteristics or behaviors distinctively adapted to specific environmental conditions. Specialization becomes particularly prevalent when competing species evolve different adaptations. This phenomenon, known as 'niche differentiation' or 'resource partitioning,' ensures that species can coexist in the same habitat without outcompeting each other. For example, some birds might evolve to eat small seeds, while others evolve to eat large seeds. Each bird species is now 'specialized' in consuming a particular seed size, allowing both to inhabit the same ecosystems without getting into direct competition. As species become highly specialized, they are more efficient at the specific tasks necessary in their particular environment. Over many generations, environmental conditions change (e.g., temperature, availability of resources, predator numbers), causing certain traits to be naturally selected for over others, continually shaping the species through this process of adaptation. This, however, doesn't make other options provided invalid entirely. For example, 'survival' is the goal of each species, and evolutionary adaptations aid in this goal by helping organisms best fit their environment. 'Rapid expansion' might be observed as species adapt to a new or changed environment, effectively exploiting resources and expanding their numbers or range. 'Extinction' can indeed occur if a species cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions. However, these are results or potential outcomes that occur, often centuries later, due to the process of evolution and adaptation. Clever exploitation, successful endurance, expansion, or even extinction are tied not only to the way species evolve to environmental conditions but also other factors like competition, availability of resources, sexual selection, etc. Thus, without ignoring other possibilities, 'specialization' is probably the most accurate answer, capturing the essence of evolution and how it tailors life to suit specific environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems. A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, \\"What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.\\" Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, \\"In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.\\" A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Immediately report the car accident to your insurance company. Also provide the insurance company with information on the other driver. Immediately filing a claim will speed up the process of getting your car repaired and securing a rental vehicle, if necessary. Do not lie when stating the facts of the accident, as this can result in denial of your coverage. The other driver may suggest not filing claims in the event of a small accident, as filing a claim will raise your rates. However, it is always a good idea to file a claim to protect yourself. The other driver may later change his mind and file a claim, even claiming injuries that weren’t apparent at the time of the accident. You want to be sure your insurance company has your version of the accident as soon as possible. Particularly if anyone was hurt in the accident, hiring a lawyer is a good idea. A lawyer can help you maximize your reward if you have been injured, or defend you if the other motorist was injured. Keep records of any hospital visits, tests, prescriptions or other expenses that arise as a result of your auto accident. This information will be needed by your insurance company and attorney. If the accident impacts your life to the extent that you decide to file a personal injury suit, you can claim damages for mental and physical distress and/or lost wages, as well as medical treatment. Keep a diary of how the injuries impact your life, including missed workdays, routine activities you cannot undertake, and changes to you family life. This will determine how much your company, or the other motorist's company if they were at fault, is willing to pay to replace or fix your car. If you think the number is too low, get your own independent estimates, and then discuss them with your adjuster. Certainly the other motorist’s company, and perhaps your own, may not have your best interests at heart.  If the other motorist’s insurance company calls you, politely refuse to discuss the accident with them and mention the call to your own insurance company or lawyer. If your company offers you an early settlement, do not sign it until you are sure you will be compensated for all your injuries. Some injuries – particularly back and neck ones caused by whiplash – might not show up or reach their maximum level of pain until weeks or even months after the accident.

Question: Given the following context:  Zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on CNN's Crossfire TV series and debated issues with Washington Times commentator John Lofton in 1986. On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the \\"Blank Tape Tax.\\" Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content \\"extortion\\" of the music industry.In his prepared statement, he said: The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to analyze their relationship. Premise: 1. Carcassonne can be disappointing at first sight.  2. The best overall view of Carcassonne is from the autoroute. 3. Carcassonne is, perhaps, most impressive when illuminated at night. Hypothesis: Carcassonne in the daytime is not nearly as impressive as it is at night. When assessing the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we can see similarities and connections between them. The first part of the premise states that Carcassonne can be disappointing at first sight, which suggests that the initial impression of Carcassonne during the daytime may not be as striking as its other features. The second part of the premise explains that the best overall view is from the autoroute, providing further context that the daytime view of the town could be underwhelming compared to other perspectives. Lastly, the third part of the premise claims that Carcassonne is perhaps most impressive when illuminated at night. This statement strongly supports the hypothesis, as it directly compares the daytime and nighttime appearances of the town and implies that the nighttime view is more striking and impressive. Taking these points into consideration, we can conclude that if the premise is true – that Carcassonne can be disappointing at first sight, the best view is from the autoroute, and the town is most impressive when illuminated at night – then the hypothesis, stating that Carcassonne in the daytime is not nearly as impressive as it is at night, is indeed true. It is important to note, however, that the hypothesis could be strengthened with more substantial evidence or firsthand accounts to better support the conclusion. Additionally, the hypothesis claims that Carcassonne in the daytime is not \\"nearly as impressive\\" as it is at night, which is a strong statement that might require a higher level of scrutiny and evidence.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\",  answer the following question.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are addressing two different topics: 1. Ways to describe a smile 2. How to keep calm I'll provide detailed answers for both questions. 1. Good ways to describe a smile: There are various ways to describe a smile depending on the context and the emotion you wish to convey. Here are some examples: - Warm smile: This indicates a friendly, welcoming, and genuine smile. - Bright smile: This suggests a radiant and lively smile. - Contagious smile: This means that the person's smile is so infectious that it makes others around them smile as well. - Shy smile: This describes a reserved and slightly bashful smile, often from someone who may be introverted or uncertain. - Beaming smile: This refers to a smile that is full of happiness, enthusiasm, and joy. - Mischievous grin: This indicates a playful, teasing, or cheeky smile. - Soft smile: This punctuates a gentle, calm, and tender expression of happiness. - Bittersweet smile: This portrays a mix of emotions, often happiness tinged with sadness or nostalgia. - Tense smile: This conveys a sense of unease or awkwardness in the smile. - Forced smile: This hints at insincerity or hiding the true feelings, like when someone smiles to be polite but doesn't truly feel happy. These are just a few examples, and there are many other ways to describe a smile by using adjectives or similes. 2. How to keep calm: Keeping calm is an essential skill to master for coping with stress, anxiety, and difficult situations. Here are some tips on how to maintain your composure: - Practice deep breathing: Focus on taking slow, deep breaths. Inhale through your nose for a count of four, hold the breath for four counts, and then exhale through your mouth for four counts. - Mindfulness meditation: Regular mindfulness meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, allowing you to respond calmly rather than reacting impulsively. - Grounding techniques: Bring yourself back to the present moment by focusing on your physical senses, such as touching an object, listening to a sound, or noticing your breath. - Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR): Tense and then relax different muscle groups throughout your body to release stress and tension. - Cognitive reframing: Change your perspective on a situation or challenge by looking at it from a different angle, identifying the positives, or considering alternative explanations. - Break tasks into smaller steps: When faced with overwhelming tasks, break them into smaller, manageable steps to feel more in control and less stressed. - Limit exposure to stressors: Identify the sources of stress and anxiety in your life and either remove them or reduce your exposure to them. - Engage in physical activity: Exercise has been proven to help reduce stress levels, so engage in regular physical activity, such as walking, jogging, or yoga. - Develop a support network: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help in managing your emotions and maintaining your calm. - Practice self-care: Take time for yourself to recharge and refresh, whether that's through hobbies, relaxation, or getting enough sleep. By incorporating these techniques into your daily life, you can develop a more resilient and calm mindset. Remember that maintaining your composure takes practice, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself when learning how to keep calm."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lester's relationship with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), an ambitious realtor who feels that she is unsuccessful at fulfilling her potential, is strained. His 16-year-old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is unhappy and struggling with self-esteem issues. Lester himself is a self-described loser: boring, faceless and easy to forget. Lester is reinvigorated, however, when he meets Jane's friend and classmate, the egotistical Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a high school basketball game. Lester immediately develops an obvious infatuation with Angela, much to his daughter's embarrassment.

Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"No, the answer provided does not accurately explain how caviar is harvested. While it gives information about the preservation process, it doesn't describe the harvesting process itself. Caviar is the processed, salted eggs (roe) of female sturgeon fish. The harvesting process typically involves the following steps: 1. Fish selection: Mature female sturgeon are selected for harvesting based on their age, species, and readiness to provide roe. This can be assessed through ultrasound technology. 2. Roe extraction: The most traditional method is surgically removing the roe sacs from the fish, but this can result in the death of the fish. To ensure sustainability, no-kill methods have been developed. One of these methods is called \\"stripping\\" or \\"milking,\\" which involves massaging the fish's abdomen to release the eggs without the need for surgery. 3. Cleaning and washing: The harvested eggs are washed in cold water to remove any impurities and membranes attached to them. 4. Sieving and draining: The washed eggs are carefully sieved to remove water and allow them to drain. 5. Salting: An appropriate amount of salt (within the range of 2.8-4% salt by weight) is added to the drained eggs. This is a crucial step, as it not only helps to preserve the caviar but also defines its taste and texture. 6. Packing: Once the caviar has been salted, it is weighed and packed into tins or glass jars to ensure minimal exposure to light and air. The containers are then sealed to maintain freshness. Caviar can be pasteurized to prolong its shelf life, but this process may compromise its flavor, texture, and economic value. Therefore, many connoisseurs and chefs prefer fresh, non-pasteurized caviar for its superior taste and quality."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:My daughter was away at college preparing for her final exams and nursing boards. I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath. I was afraid my daughter was going to be angry with me when I told her that i made the decision with out giving her time to say goodbye. She was sad but understood that I did the kindest thing I could have done for her kitty. Who cared for the cat after its illness?  A. The vet and daughter.  B. not enough information  C. The vet and mother.  D. The mother and daughter. A:","output":"C. The vet and mother."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Review: This movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men, and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer. Few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence, and I can think of no other movie -- documentary or drama -- that achieves it. There is no other movie in which I have both laughed so much and cried so much. Yes, it is about DMD and accessible travel; on those issues alone, it is a worthwhile venture, but it is more. It is about friendship. It is about life itself, about living every day that you're alive. And it's a great, fun, adventurous narrative. This is why God created the cinema! See this movie!!!

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the mother of girl who is dating a rebellious teen? from the following article ?  Deena Marten is a 15-year-old who has become a rebel since dating Garret Lexau, another rebellious teen who was suspended from school for hitting a teacher. Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not  heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do. When Deena discovers what Cynthia has done, she is less than grateful and reacts violently and ends up pushing her mother. Adam, Deena's younger brother notices the impact that Deena's behavior has upon his mother and drinks alcohol in order to forget about the family problems. At one point, Cynthia and Deena's relationship seems to improve, until Cynthia finds out that she has been skipping school. Her confrontation leads to an argument, during which Deena slaps her. Although she admits to Garret that she liked hitting her, Deena later apologizes to her mother, only to ask her to cover for her absence at school.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: LONDON (Reuters) - A French man who was running late for his flight from London to Los Angeles tried to delay it by calling police to say there was a bomb on board.      Librarian Jacob Meir Abdellak, who lives in east London, made the call eight minutes before his 5.47 a.m. Norwegian Air flight from Gatwick Airport was due to leave on May 11 because he was significantly late and airline staff had refused to allow him on board, a court heard.      His hoax meant passengers had to be re-screened and take-off was delayed by 90 minutes. An investigation by Gatwick revealed that the hoax call had been made using the same number linked to his booking.      When Abdellak returned to the airport to take another flight to the United States on May 22, he was arrested.      He initially claimed he had lost his phone’s SIM card but on Tuesday pleaded guilty at Lewes Crown Court to communicating false information regarding a noxious substance likely to create serious risk to human health. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison.      “This was a quite ridiculous decision made by Abdellak, who fabricated an extremely serious allegation purely for his own benefit,” said Gatwick Police Chief Inspector Marc Clothier on Thursday.      “He was running late for his flight and thought it would be a good idea to call in a hoax bomb, however this turned out to be the worst decision he could have made.” ||||| An airline passenger made an anonymous hoax bomb threat to delay his flight because he was running late.      Librarian Jacob Meir Abdellak called police at 5.46am on 11 May - just eight minutes before the plane was due to set off from London's Gatwick Airport to Los Angeles in the US.      Officials were forced to postpone take-off for 90 minutes to carry out a full security screening.      Abdellak arrived \\"significantly late\\" and became abusive when he was prevented from boarding by airline staff and told to rearrange his trip for another date.      The Frenchman was arrested when he returned eleven days later on 22 May to catch another flight to the US.      Investigators had discovered the phone number used to make the bomb threat was the same one used to make the flight booking with Norwegian Airlines.      He admitted it was his number but claimed he had lost the SIM card a few days before the hoax call was made.      Abdellak, of Amhurst Park, Hackney, was charged with communicating false information regarding a noxious substance likely to create serious risk to human health.      He denied the offence until the day of his trial at Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday, when he changed his plea to guilty.      Abdellak was jailed for 10 months and ordered to pay a £140 victim surcharge.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Eight Men Out Movie plot: In 1919, the Chicago White Sox are considered the greatest team in baseball and, in fact, one of the greatest ever assembled to that point, behind their greatest star, Joe Jackson. However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When gamblers \\"Sleepy\\" Bill Burns and Billy Maharg get wind of the players' discontent, they offer a select group of Sox â including star knuckleball pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who led the majors with a 29-7 win-loss record and has an earned run average of just 1.82 â more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Cicotte's motivation for being involved was because Comiskey refused him a promised 10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone until Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for 2 weeks (missing 5 starts) to rest the 35-year-old veteran's arm for the series. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. Jackson is depicted as being not bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte (pitching in Game 1) deliberately hits Reds leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back with his second pitch in a prearranged signal to gangster Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on (Rothstein allegedly financed the fix). Cicotte then pitches poorly and gave up 5 runs in four inningsâfour of them in the 4th, including a triple given up to Reds pitcher Walter \\"Dutch\\" Ruether. He is then relieved by Gleason, though the Sox lose the first game 9â1. Williams also pitched poorly in Game 2, while Gandil, Risberg and Hap Felsch made glaring mistakes on the field. Several of the players become upset, however, when the various gamblers involved fail to pay their promised money up front. Chicago... My question: who is the sox star knuckleball pitcher? The answer is:","output":"Eddie Cicotte is the Sox star knuckleball pitcher in the movie plot of \\"Eight Men Out.\\" He led the majors with a 29-7 win-loss record and had an earned run average of just 1.82.

What will happen to the earth if the sun stops giving light, considering gravity is not affected? What would happen if the Earth abruptly stopped spinning for 42 seconds? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick from: [+] no; [+] yes;","output":"[+] no; These questions do not have the same meaning. Let me explain each question and their consequences separately. 1. If the sun stops giving light, considering gravity is not affected: Step 1: Determine the premise. The sun stops emitting light, but its gravity remains unchanged. Step 2: Understand the effect on Earth. Without the sun's light, Earth would become pitch dark. Step 3: Assess the impact on temperature. Earth's temperature would drop rapidly as we lose the source of heat and energy. Step 4: Determine consequences for life. Photosynthesis would cease, and the food chain would be disrupted, leading to the extinction of most, if not all, life forms. 2. If the Earth abruptly stopped spinning for 42 seconds: Step 1: Determine the premise. Earth's rotation comes to a sudden halt for 42 seconds. Step 2: Understand the effect on Earth. Earth's surface and the atmosphere have momentum due to rotation. An abrupt stop would cause everything on Earth to continue moving at high speeds (e.g., at the equator, approximately 1670 km/h). Step 3: Assess the impact on structures and life. Buildings, infrastructure, and living beings would experience severe destruction and loss of life due to the rapid motion. Step 4: Determine consequences for day and night patterns. After the 42 seconds, Earth would resume its spin, and the day and night cycle would be disrupted for a short period. The difference between these questions is that the first one addresses the effect of the sun's light suddenly vanishing, while the second one considers the implications of Earth's rotational motion stopping for a specific duration. Both scenarios have unique consequences, and they are not the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

A shallow container of salt water is placed in sunlight for a day. Which is the most likely result?","output":"The most likely result of placing a shallow container of salt water in sunlight for a day is that the water will undergo evaporation, potentially leaving behind a layer of salt at the bottom of the container. This process occurs due to the interaction between sunlight, water, and salt, as explained in detail below: 1. Sunlight: As the shallow container is exposed to sunlight, the energy from the sun in the form of solar radiation leads to an increase in the temperature of the water. This thermal energy causes the water molecules to gain kinetic energy, making them move faster. 2. Evaporation: With the gained energy from sunlight, the water molecules at the surface of the container will have enough energy to overcome the hydrogen bonds holding them together, allowing them to break free from the liquid state and become water vapor. This process, known as evaporation, results in a decrease in the volume of the liquid water in the container. The rate of evaporation will depend on various factors such as the intensity of sunlight, the surface area of the container, ambient temperature, humidity, and the presence of any barriers to the escape of water vapor. 3. Salt concentration: As the water evaporates, the salt in the solution becomes more concentrated because the salt ions remain in the liquid state and do not evaporate with the water molecules. The concentration of the salt will continue to increase as more and more water evaporates from the container. 4. Crystallization: Once the salt concentration within the container reaches a certain level called the saturation point, no more salt can dissolve in the remaining water. At this stage, any additional evaporation will cause the dissolved salt to start forming solid salt crystals. These crystals will grow in size as more water evaporates, eventually leading to a layer of salt at the bottom of the container. 5. Complete evaporation: If the shallow container is left in sunlight for an extended period and the environmental conditions are favorable, it is possible for almost all of the water to evaporate, leaving behind only the solid salt crystals. The appearance, size, and structure of the salt crystals will depend on factors such as the type of salt present in the water, the rate at which the water evaporated, and the presence of any impurities in the solution. In summary, placing a shallow container of salt water in sunlight for a day will most likely result in the evaporation of water and an increase in salt concentration. Depending on the specific conditions, this might lead to the formation of salt crystals at the bottom of the container by the end of the day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Species in this subgenus are:  - The tomato (see pronunciation) is the edible fruit of \\"Solanum lycopersicum\\", commonly known as a tomato plant, which belongs to the nightshade family, \\"Solanaceae\\". The species originated in Central and South America. The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word \\"tomatl\\" gave rise to the Spanish word \\"tomate\\", from which the English word tomato originates. Numerous varieties of tomato are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing its production throughout the year and in cooler areas. The plants typically grow to in height and have a weak stem that often sprawls over the ground and vines over other plants. It is a perennial in its native habitat, and grown as an annual in temperate climates. An average common tomato weighs approximately . Its use as a food originated in Mexico, and spread throughout the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are botanically berry-type fruits, they are considered culinary vegetables, being ingredients of savory meals.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Microtus is a genus of voles found in North America, Europe, and northern Asia. The genus name refers to the small ears of these animals. About 62 species are placed in the genus. They are stout rodents with short ears, legs, and tails. They eat green vegetation such as grasses and sedges in summer, and grains, seeds, roots, and bark at other times. The genus is also called \\"meadow voles\\". (ITIS database) The species are: Subgenus \\"Microtus\\" Subgenus \\"Terricola\\" Subgenus \\"Mynomes\\" Subgenus \\"Alexandromys\\" Subgenus \\"Stenocranius\\" Subgenus \\"Pitymys\\" Subgenus \\"Pedomys\\" Subgenus \\"Hyrcanicola\\"  - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - The water voles are large voles in the genus Arvicola . They are found in both aquatic and dry habitat through Europe and much of northern Asia . A water vole found in Western North America was historically considered a member of this genus , but has been shown to be more closely related to members of the genus Microtus ( Conroy and Cook , 2000 ; Musser and Carleton , 2005 ) . Head and body length are 12 -- 22 cm , tail length is 6.5 -- 12.5 cm , and the weight is 70 -- 250 g. The animals may exhibit indeterminate growth . They are thick - furred and have hairy fringe on feet that improves their swimming ability .  - Alexandromys is a subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are:  - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants.  - A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (\\"Mus musculus\\"). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.  - Mynomes is a North American subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are: References. D.E. Wilson & D.M. Reeder, 2005: Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference. Third Edition. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.  - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .  - The Arvicolinae are a subfamily of rodents that includes the voles, lemmings, and muskrats. They are most closely related to the other subfamilies in the Cricetidae (comprising the hamsters and New World rats and mice). Some authorities place the subfamily Arvicolinae in the family Muridae along with all other members of the superfamily Muroidea. Some refer to the subfamily as the Microtinae or rank the taxon as a full family, the Arvicolidae.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - In biology and botany, indeterminate growth is growth that is not terminated in contrast to determinate growth that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces flowers and fruit until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to tomato varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth/fruit, or dies.  - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.  - A lemming is a small rodent, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes. Lemmings are subniveal animals and together with voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae), which forms part of the largest mammal radiation by far, the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils.  - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.    What entity does 'arvicola' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

Write an article based on this \\"Experts have scientific proof that us humans really do fall in love with our dogs.\\"","output":"Title: The Science of Puppy Love: Unveiling the Human-Canine Bond Ever since the domestication of dogs, which scientists estimate to have occurred approximately 15,000 years ago, humans have nurtured an unwavering fondness for these lovable creatures. Many cultures have worshipped dogs as sacred beings or used canine symbols in their mythology, cementing the profound relationship that we, as humans, have shared with our four-legged companions throughout history. But is the bond between humans and dogs just emotional, or is there underlying scientific evidence that explains why we fall in love with our dogs? The answer, it seems, is embodied in a captivating combination of biology, evolution, and social behavior. One key piece of evidence originates from a field of science dubbed \\"evolutionary psychology\\". Multiple studies within this discipline propose that humans' natural affinity towards dogs is interlinked with our species' evolutionary history. Early humans who were capable of forming strong alliances with animals, particularly dogs, tended to survive longer, benefiting from dogs' hunting skills, protection, and company. This symbiotic relationship, sculpted over thousands of years, has deepened the affectionate connection between humans and dogs, shaping an emotional bond that we often associate with love. But how do we quantify love? To comprehend why we fall in love with our dogs, it is essential to understand the neurochemical processes that underlie these intensely powerful feelings. The hormone oxytocin, often labeled as the \\"love hormone,\\" significantly contributes to this bonding process. When humans interact with their dogs, levels of oxytocin increase in both species. This mutual biochemical interaction was discovered by a group of Japanese researchers in 2015. They found that dog owners and their pets, after gazing into each others' eyes, experienced a notable rise in their oxytocin levels, akin to the bond between a mother and her infant. Such findings illustrate a tangible neurochemical basis for humans' profound love for dogs. It is not just hormones and evolutionary history, though; a significant facet of this strong bond is also rooted in social behavior. Scientifically speaking, dogs are one of the few species that seek out eye contact with humans and can accurately read our emotions. This capacity to communicate non-verbally fosters a deep interpersonal connection, a hallmark of love in human relationships. Moreover, several psychologists argue that the attachment between humans and their pets parallels the bond between parents and their children. The term \\"secure base effect\\", coined by John Bowlby in his attachment theory, is often applied to explain this relationship. Dogs, like children, consider their caretakers as a secure base from which they can explore their environment. This significant role creates an emotionally enriched bond, further driving the loving relationship between humans and their dogs. Research also unveils the beneficial impact of this bond on human health. Petting a dog can lower blood pressure, reduce stress hormones, and increase serotonin and dopamine levels – the 'feel-good' chemicals. In this scientifically-backed framework of mutual attachment and wellness-boosting, the idea of humans 'falling in love' with their dogs becomes more than just a romanticized notion. In conclusion, from the perspectives of evolutionary psychology, neurochemistry, and social behavior, there is considerable scientific evidence supporting the profound bond - or rather, profound love - that humans share with their dogs. While the language of love can often seem unquantifiable and immeasurable, it is gratifying to note that the affection we share with our canine companions is deep-rooted in biology and science - a true testament to the thousands of years of our shared evolutionary journey. Therefore, the saying that a dog is a man's best friend may not just be a catchy phrase; it might be an anthrozoological fact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Greeks The Greeks of classical antiquity idealized their Mycenaean ancestors and the Mycenaean period as a glorious era of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The Homeric Epics (i.e. Iliad and Odyssey) were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece (e.g. Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity. Q: How did they believe their forebears lived ?","output":"The ancient Greeks believed that their forebears, the Mycenaean civilization, lived a life full of grandeur, heroism, and divine connection. They held the Mycenaean period in high esteem and shaped their understanding of the past through the stories and myths passed down through generations. The Homeric epics – the Iliad and the Odyssey – played a crucial role in shaping this perception, as they described a world where legendary heroes triumphed, divine intervention was accepted and revered, and rich material wealth was abundant. The forebears were believed to live in well-organized, fortified cities or palaces, with an advanced civilization that strived in art, trade, and warfare. They were ruled by powerful kings and had sophisticated social structures. The Greeks viewed these rulers as strong and just, capable of protecting their people and ensuring their prosperity. In terms of religious beliefs, the Greeks thought that their forebears shared similar practices and ideas, such as the worship of the various Olympian gods and goddesses like Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. They placed a strong emphasis on rituals and offerings to communicate with these gods, seeking favor, and attempting to appease them as needed. The Greeks also thought that their ancestors received direct guidance and assistance from these deities in matters of life, war, and love, which further emphasized the close connection between the human and divine realms. The ancient Greeks believed that their Mycenaean ancestors excelled in various arts and skills, such as poetry, music, architecture, and craftsmanship. The epics of Homer, which are set during the Mycenaean period, exemplify this belief in excellence, as they portray characters exhibiting exceptional abilities and talents. This perception of the past often linked moral virtue and physical prowess, both of which were essential for a hero in Greek thought to possess. Additionally, the Greeks considered their forebears to be morally upright and guided by a strong sense of honor, justice, and loyalty. These values laid the foundation for the Greeks' own societal norms and expectations, as they sought to emulate and preserve the ways of their ancestors. In summary, the ancient Greeks believed that their Mycenaean forebears lived in a golden age filled with material wealth, divine guidance, and heroic virtue. The influence of the Homeric epics and the myths surrounding this period played a significant role in shaping their understanding of their ancestors, which in turn helped to define their own values and beliefs. Though historical research has since provided a more objective view of the Mycenaean civilization, the ancient Greeks' perception of their forebears remains a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and myth in shaping cultural memory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Abandoned chicken shed has been transformed into a luxury home… and is up for a top UK architecture prize You can stay in the South Wales property for £175 a night after £250k makeover A RUN-DOWN chicken shed is up for a top architecture prize – after being transformed into a stylish home. The abandoned hen-house was given a state-of-the-art £275,000 makeover, transforming it into a modern four-bedroom bungalow. Architect Martin Hall saw the cracking potential of the egg-laying shed, due to the stunning views of the Black Mountains on the Welsh border. As a result, the ramshackle wooden barn, which was left abandoned for decades, has been given a new lease of life after being converted it into a luxury holiday property, available to anyone who can shell out £175 a night. The rural holiday home, in Monmouth, South Wales, features floor to ceiling glass walls, allowing light to spill into the plush interior which can accommodate up to eight people. It has now been shortlisted for the Gold Medal for Architecture at Wales’ biggest arts festival, the National Eisteddfod. A spokesman for architects Hall and Bednarczyk said: “The former poultry barn was abandoned for several decades and in a rundown state. “We demonstrated how its utilitarian agricultural identity could be retained in a convincing and contemporary architectural form.” The Chepstow-based architects added: “The roof and flanking walls employ black corrugated sheeting and timber cladding in a refined and affectionate re-working of typical agricultural materials. “Polished concrete floors and boarded timber walls provide a sophisticated nod to the building’s humble origins.” The Gold Medal recognises architectural excellence and the winner will be announced during the festival in early August. And whether the gorgeous renovated property wins or not – it’s not bad at all for an old chicken coop.

They are also priced MUCH higher . Nonetheless , we seized the opportunity and my agent convinced the other two agents they they should all have an open house on the same afternoon . Question What is the implication of the other homes going up for sale Answer:","output":"The implication of the other homes going up for sale means that there are more houses available for people to buy in the same area. Since these houses are more typical and more expensive, they might not be direct competition to your house, but it's still good to know what other options people have when looking for a home. By having an open house for all three houses on the same afternoon, it can bring more potential buyers to the area and increase the chances of someone being interested in your house."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: Education and Skills Minister Huw Lewis told the Senedd he would support plans to rebrand the subject as \\"religion, philosophy and ethics\\" last month. The Welsh government said a new curriculum could help \\"develop respect and understanding for other cultures\\". But what difference would the potential shake-up make to how Religious Education (RE) is taught in schools? The government is looking at a revamp of the curriculum for all subjects, in line with recommendations made by Professor Graham Donaldson in his Successful Futures report. Mr Lewis said the potential changes to RE could encourage pupils to also consider \\"ethics and citizenship\\" and \\"what it means to be a citizen of a free country\\". The move has been welcomed by the Humanist Society, which represents non-religious people. But faith groups have criticised the proposal with Rheinallt Thomas, former head of the national religious education centre, claiming there will be a campaign against it. Former Cardiff head teacher and Methodist lay preacher, David Kitchen, told BBC Radio Wales: \\"Some people will be appalled because they will see it as dilution\\". However, he said the repositioning of RE could be \\"interesting\\", pointing to the clear link between the big questions in philosophy and religion. \\"The problem will be there is an enormous territory,\\" he added. \\"You could have something that's woolly and flaccid and, frankly, a bit dull.\\" The education minister said schools needed to \\"rise to the challenge\\" of improving community cohesion, when outlining his vision to the Senedd in mid July. In response to a question about tackling extremism, Mr Lewis said: \\"My proposal...my contention would be that we rename the RE curriculum and transform it into the religion, philosophy and ethics element of the curriculum\\". He said there would be an \\"an explicit commitment to allowing children to ponder ideas around ethics and citizenship and what it means to be a citizen of a free country\\". But Saleem Kidwai, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Wales, said only effective RE teaching could create a \\"better understanding\\" of the \\"similarities and values\\" of different faiths. He said positioning RE alongside the other suggested subjects would not be helpful. \\"Ethics and philosophy are part of my religion. So, if religion is taught properly then it will encompass all of those things,\\" he added. \\"The same goes for the Jewish and Christian community and other faith communities.\\" The teaching of RE is currently a statutory curriculum requirement for pupils from reception onwards, as part of humanities. It would remain so under the recommendations. The Welsh government has invited schools to apply to become \\"pioneer\\" institutions, which will help to shape the \\"detailed design and the development of the new inclusive curriculum\\" across all subjects. \\"These schools will draw in experts to help them shape all aspects of the new curriculum, including statutory Religious Education, philosophy and ethics within the humanities area of learning and experience,\\" a spokesman said.

Our plan was to drive into Cambridge, catch the 7:34 train to Liverpool Street Station, then to separate and meet again for lunch. We should have arrived at Liverpool at 9:19, but due to a typical London fog, the train had to move along so slowly that it was not until 10:30 that it got there. In spite of our late arrival, Joan, my wife's sister, decided that she would go to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London while we went shopping. It was only after her sister had disappeared into the fog that my wife realized that we hadn't decided where we should meet for lunch. Since I had our three tickets for the concert in my pocket, this was indeed a problem. There seemed to be nothing we could do except taking a taxi to the Tower of London, and try to find her there. Needless to say, we didn't find her. It was now one o'clock, and the concert began at 2:30. \\"Perhaps she will think of waiting outside the concert hall,\\" suggested my wife hopefully. By this time the fog was so thick that road traffic had to stop, and the only way to get there was by underground railway. Hand in hand we felt our way along the road to where we thought the nearest station should be. An hour later we were still trying to find it. Just as I was about to lose my temper completely when we met a blind man tapping his way confidently through the fog. With his help we found Tower Hill tube station just fifty yards down the road.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Eighteen-year-old Michael Corben (Richard Grieco) of Detroit, Michigan, is a slacker. Rather than attending his high school French class, he spends all of his time drinking and partying, until come graduation when all of his debauchery catches up to him and he learns that he cannot graduate without a French credit. He has only one more chance to obtain the credit: the French teacher, Mrs. Grober (Robin Bartlett), and the French Club are headed to France for summer school, and Michael must accompany them and participate if he wants to graduate next summer. However, at the airport, a CIA agent also named Michael Corben (David McIlwraith) who is on his way to France as well, is killed by the assassin Ilsa Grunt (Linda Hunt), henchwoman and surrogate mother of the villainous Augustus Steranko (Roger Rees) who seeks to steal all of the gold in Europe and use it to mint his own coins under the guise of a common currency. Because important details about the agent's identity (including his actual age) have been kept meticulously secret, Michael is mistaken for the CIA agent. He is inexplicably boarded first class on his flight to Paris, and upon arrival is whisked away by British Intelligence. The late Agent Corben's mission had been to protect Augustus Steranko, who (being not suspected to be evil) has been murdering European finance ministers as part of his plan.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who introduced the band to to cannabis while visiting them in their New York hotel suite? from the following article ?  Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South. When informed that the venue for their 11 September concert, the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida,...

I have a new situation: Joe is at a party and carrying around a can of beer that he has had in his hand for awhile. He bumps into Sally, and they begin chatting. During their conversation, Sally notices the beer in Joe's hand, and remarks that a beer sounds like a good idea. She heads over to the refrigerator and grabs a nice cold one and pops it open. She takes a sip while the two continue their chat.  But I can use this background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  What is an answer for this question: Which person's beer has molecules farther apart? A:","output":"A: Based on the given situations and the background information about the behavior of water (and by extension, the behavior of beer, which mainly consists of water), Joe's beer would have molecules farther apart compared to Sally's beer. Here's an explanation: - Joe has been carrying his beer around for a while, which means it has likely warmed up due to the room temperature and body heat from his hand. As the temperature of the beer increases, the molecular motion speeds up, and the molecules move farther apart. - Sally has just taken her beer from the refrigerator, meaning it is still cold and at a lower temperature than Joe's beer. The molecular motion in her beer is slower, and the molecules are closer to one another. Thus, Joe's beer has molecules farther apart than Sally's beer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I have nothing against religious movies. Religious people need something to watch on a Saturday night, I guess. But what really ticks me off is when the write-up on the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. Passing off religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT cool, bro. And even if I was a religious person, I would have to agree with most of the other posters here, this movie was a mess. Poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly edited, and the attempt at a soundtrack was hilarious. The fake accents were terrible, the characters were mainly stereotypes, and continuity was out the window. The only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. Should have just gone to bed. Absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie, unless you are the religious type who will immediately endorse anything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers, even if it's a pile of garbage. If you aren't, avoid this at all costs. Do not be deceived by the box write-up. What is the sentiment of this review? Choose from: [i] negative. [ii] positive.","output":"[i] negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Information:  - A general election was held in the Northern Territory on Saturday June 7 , 1980 . It was the first to be held since self - government was attained two years earlier , and was won by the incumbent Country Liberal Party ( CLP ) under Chief Minister Paul Everingham . Although the CLP 's share of the vote increased by almost 10 percentage points , it lost one seat . The only independent member of the Legislative Assembly , Dawn Lawrie , retained her seat of Nightcliff .  - Paul Anthony Edward Everingham AO (born 4 February 1943) was the head of government of the Northern Territory from 1977 to 1984, serving as the second and last Majority Leader (19771978) and the first Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 1978 to 1984.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is the head of government of the Northern Territory. The office is the equivalent of a State Premier.  When the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was created in 1974, the head of government was officially known as Majority Leader. This title was used in the first parliament (19741977) and the first eighteen months of the second. When self-government was granted the Northern Territory in 1978, the title of the head of government became Chief Minister.
