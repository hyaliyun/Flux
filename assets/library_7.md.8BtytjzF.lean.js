Let me break down the differences between the two sentences for a better understanding.  Sentence 1: However, many of the tourists do not hike, and only visit the suspension bridge. This sentence indicates that there are a number of tourists who choose not to go hiking and prefer visiting the suspension bridge. It implies that the suspension bridge is a popular tourist destination, and there might be other attractions or activities available at the location besides hiking. The focus of this sentence is on the tourists who don't hike. Sentence 2: However, many tourists do not visit the suspension bridge and only hike. In this sentence, it states that there is a group of tourists who do not visit the suspension bridge and choose to go hiking instead. The sentence implies that hiking is a popular activity among tourists, and there might be other trails or hiking spots available for them to explore that do not include the suspension bridge.

Help as much as you can. Q:I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory. Question: What is the first chore the mother does later? Options: - She cleans dishes.   - not enough information   - She irons clothes.   - She washes clothes. === The correct answer is A:","output":"- not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a choice of categories company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, the text refers to which one? Answer:","output":"The text refers to the category of \\"animal.\\" Specifically, Cleoeromene is a genus of moths, which are a type of insect. Therefore, the reference falls under the animal kingdom or fauna in biological classification. While humans often use the term \\"animal\\" to refer to mammals, biologically speaking, it extends to a wide range of creatures in the kingdom Animalia, including everything from insects like moths to mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, etc. The categorization of moths under \\"animals\\" makes sense when one understands the primary categories of life according to biological taxonomy. These fundamental categories begin with the three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Within the Eukarya domain, which includes organisms with complex cells, we find the kingdom Animalia. This kingdom includes creatures with certain shared characteristics, including multi-cellular bodies, the capability of movement at some stage of life, heterotrophic (they consume other organisms for sustenance), and a specific, complex method of reproduction and development. Inside the kingdom Animalia, there is further classification into phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species - these rankings demonstrate the evolutionary relationships and shared characteristics between animals. In this context, Cleoeromene is a genus within the Crambidae family, which is a part of the order Lepidoptera - the insect order that includes both butterflies and moths. This detailed classification process is a tool that scientists use to understand the vast diversity of the animal kingdom. So, in conclusion, Cleoeromene is related to the category of \\"animal\\" among the given options. Moths are insects, and insects are a large and diverse group of animals. It's important to note that this is a scientific definition of animal, which includes a much larger group of creatures than the layperson's definition of animals."},{"instruction":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Stash Pumpkin Spice Tea Review: This was not the 1st time I've purchased this tea.

Use evidence from the fact that if a tree is cut down then that tree will die to answer the following question. Choose from options. \\"If a tree is cut down what will happen to it?\\" Pick your answer from:  -- vitality extinguishing;  -- growth;  -- vigor;  -- life;","output":"When a tree is cut down, it experiences a significant and irreversible impact on its biological functions, leading to its eventual death. Among the options provided, \\"vitality extinguishing\\" best represents the outcome of a tree being cut down. When a tree is felled, it loses its ability to photosynthesize - the process by which trees and other plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This loss is due to the removal of leaves and branches, which contain chlorophyll, necessary for the absorption of sunlight. Consequently, energy production is disrupted, and the tree cannot sustain its growth, repair any damage, or carry out other essential biological processes. Moreover, cutting down a tree disrupts its ability to transport nutrients and water. Trees have a complex vascular system - xylem and phloem - that delivers essential nutrients, minerals, and water throughout the plant. Severing the trunk obstructs these pathways, leading to a depletion of nutrients, and eventually causing the tree to wither and die. Furthermore, the disruption of a tree's vascular system exposes it to harmful pathogens and pests, which can lead to accelerated decay and death. In addition, the root system of a tree is also affected when it is cut down. Roots not only anchor a tree to the ground but also play a vital role in the absorption of water and nutrients from soil. However, with the tree's death, roots lose their ability to obtain resources, compromising the tree's overall health further. In conclusion, cutting down a tree results in the loss of its ability to photosynthesize, transport nutrients and water, and maintain a healthy root system. All of these factors contribute to the \\"vitality extinguishing\\" of the tree, ultimately leading to its death."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In May 1970, the Revolutionary Intellectuals Seminar was organized to bring Libyan intellectuals in line with the revolution's ideology and objectives; this further solidified the RCC's stance on political parties. In order to maintain control and ensure the revolutionary objectives were being pursued without opposition, the RCC maintained the monarchy's ban on political parties.

Ian is making a pool party for Neil and needs to raise pH in a pool, so  Available options: A). Ian buys pH raising preparates.. B). Neil buys pH raising preparates..","output":"A). Ian buys pH raising preparates.. After a detailed brainstorming session, Ian decides that he should be the one to take responsibility for raising the pH level of the pool. After all, he's the host of the party and it would be unbecoming to impose such a task on the guest of honor, Neil. So, Ian starts to research how to effectively raise the pH in a pool. Ian finds out that making changes to the pool's pH level is not a task that should be taken lightly, as the pH level of the pool affects bather comfort and the efficiency of the disinfection process. A bit of extra knowledge and understanding of water chemistry can be key to maintaining a healthy and balanced swimming pool. Ian learns that the ideal pH level for a pool is typically between 7.4 and 7.6. Too low a pH level indicates acidity, which can cause issues such as skin irritation for swimmers and potential damage to the pool equipment. A high pH level indicates that the water is too alkaline, which can cause cloudy water and reduce the effectiveness of chlorine. To raise the pH level, Ian needs to purchase a pH increaser, also known as a pH plus or pH up product. These are typically soda ash (sodium carbonate) or sodium bicarbonate, which are alkaline substances that neutralize the acidity in the pool water. Ian decides to visit a local pool supply store to get the materials needed. In the store, Ian meets with a pool expert who gives him more insight about using pH raising preparates. Ian learns that it's crucial to add these chemicals gradually, so as to avoid drastically altering the water pH, which could result in a condition known as pH bounce. On the day of the party, Ian wakes up early to prepare the pool. He doses the pool according to the instructions on the pH increaser package. After adding the product, Ian uses a pool testing kit to ensure that the pH of the water is ideal. If it's not, Ian continues the process, following the instructions and testing the water until the desired pH level is achieved. Throughout the party, Ian makes sure to periodically test the pool water to ensure the pH level stays within the ideal range. This ensures that the comfort of Neil and all the other guests remains top priority throughout the event. If Ian had chosen option B, and Neil had bought the pH raising preparates, the story might have unfolded differently. Neil may not have had an in-depth understanding of water chemistry or been aware of the importance of maintaining pH levels, leading to potential discomfort for the party guests, or damage to the pool. By taking on the responsibility himself, Ian ensured not only the success of his pool party but also Neil's comfort and enjoyment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Firstly, we need to determine the most suitable choice among the given options. In this case, the question focuses on how people perceive individuals who are always holding a remote. 2. Individuals who are always holding a remote might be perceived as being more interested in electronic devices and possibly, less in need of human interaction. This might give others the impression that they are less likely to engage in social activities or conversations. 3. The given choices are mostly positive traits associated with personal relationships (attached, lovable, companionable, close, likely).

However, the United States -- which ranked 159 on the overall list of 178 countries, followed by France and the United Kingdom in a subcategory of \\"very stable\\" countries -- was among the countries that have worsened the most over the past year, a new report says. The index is based on 12 social, economic and political indicators, including demographic pressures, poverty and economic decline, human rights and political impasse. Until this year, the nonprofit referred to it as the list of failed states. Somalia had led the list for six years. Somalia's fall to second place is due to its \\"trajectory of improvement,\\" despite lawlessness, terrorism and ineffective government, the group said. Other countries in the top 10 are the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Chad, Afghanistan, Yemen, Haiti and Pakistan. Syria was not left out: Its yearslong civil war placed it at No. 15. Iran leads in improvement. The list had some surprises as well. Iran led a pack of most-improved nations, with the report saying it had stabilized somewhat \\"after recent political and social turmoil.\\" The most-improved group included a cluster of countries with tense relations with the United States -- \\"quite coincidentally,\\" according to the report's authors -- including Zimbabwe, Cuba, Bolivia and China.

France was listed as the seventh-most-worsened country this year, \\"largely as a result of a political and economic malaise,\\" the group said. It said the United States tied with Singapore and Thailand for eighth-most-worsened country. The top nation on that list was the Central African Republic, which is deep in a conflict involving widespread atrocities.

As a tribute, the high priests Hotep and Huy offer him a beautiful young Midianite woman, Tzipporah, and Rameses gives her to Moses. Rameses then appoints him Royal Chief Architect.

Two adults and two children were killed in an apparent murder-suicide Sunday at an apartment building in California's Central Valley, while a fifth person was hospitalized in critical condition, police said.      Police were called to investigate a disturbance at the Fresno home shortly before 7 a.m. They found a man outside the apartment suffering from a stab wound, The Fresno Bee reported ( http://bit.ly/ACSNqA).      Capt. Dennis Bridges told the newspaper that officers then heard a single gunshot. When they went inside the apartment, they found a woman believed to be in her 20s with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and a man in his 20s or 30s dead of a gunshot wound.      Two children _ an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old _ also died from gunshot wounds.      \\"We're investigating to determine exactly how the children and the adult male died and the circumstances around the man suffering from a stab wound,\\" Bridges said. He did not know if there was a history of domestic violence calls or other disturbances at the apartment.      The man suffering from the stab wound was taken to a local hospital, where he was reported to be in critical condition.      A neighbor, Eric Gonzalez, described the residents of the apartment as a \\"normal\\" family.      \\"I never saw them fighting. They would come out with the baby carriage, and the man was taking care of his children,\\" he told an Associated Press reporter outside the apartment complex.

Police didn't immediately return calls from the AP seeking additional information.      ___      Information from: The Fresno Bee, http://www.fresnobee.com ||||| Fresno police were trying Sunday to unravel a tragic mystery at a southeast Fresno apartment complex: What led to the shooting deaths of four people in a spree that ended with the mother of two of the young victims killing herself as police were at the door. A disturbance call at 6:44 a.m. Sunday led officers to a man with a stab wound just outside a ground-floor unit at the Silver Lake Apartments on East Belmont Avenue, near Clovis Avenue, police Capt. Dennis Bridges said. As officers provided aid to the man, they learned that children were inside the apartment, Bridges said. Officers at the front door were weighing whether to enter the apartment when they heard a single gunshot inside. That's when they rushed in and found a woman in her 20s, who they believe is the stabbing victim's wife, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Bridges said. The couple's two children, an 18-month-old girl and a 3-year-old boy, also were found with fatal gunshot wounds. In the kitchen, police found a man in his 20s or 30s also shot to death. Police did not reveal his relationship to the family, or say where the mother and her children were found in the apartment. Police did not identify the victims.      The injured man, whose age was not known, was taken to Community Regional Medical Center, where he was reported in critical condition. One neighbor, Jaime Sosa, said the man appeared to be alert when paramedics were treating him. Bridges said investigators were trying to determine what happened -- and why. \\"We're investigating to determine exactly how the children and the adult male died and the circumstances around the man suffering from a stab wound,\\" Bridges said. Police said they expected to release more information today. Bridges did not know whether there was a history of domestic violence calls or other disturbances at the apartment in the past. Neighbors, though, said they had not seen or heard of any problems at that apartment. The couple, their two children and the woman's cousin had lived in the apartment for about four years, neighbors said. The gated apartment complex has manicured lawns, mature trees and a play area for children in the rear of the complex where the family lived. Neighbors say the family kept to themselves, but the father and his children often were seen playing on the small playground. About a dozen people waited behind police tape at 4 p.m. to watch investigators remove the bodies from the first-floor apartment. Red icicle lights still hung from the front awning and on a side bush. Resident Eric Gonzalez watched in disbelief. He didn't know the family well, but ran into the husband several times in the laundry room or in passing on the apartment grounds. \\"They were nice people,\\" Gonzalez said. \\"The husband and wife seemed like they were in love with each other.\\"      The reporter can be reached at blee@fresnobee.com or (559) 441-6495.

Question: Who takes Missy into the mining caves? Title: The Hills Have Eyes 2 Movie plot: A captive womanâforced to breed mutant childrenâgives birth to a stillborn. She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in the New Mexico desert are attacked by Letch. A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the United States Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and Amber (Jessica Stroup). The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group Amber is attacked by Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and the sergeant is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others attempt to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen they are forced to try to find another way down. The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves. After the group kills Stabber, Missy is captured and taken into the mining caves by Chameleon. Chameleon attempts to rape her, but Missy fights...

SEATTLE, WA - Two women were found dead inside a University District apartment near the University of Washington Tuesday morning, according to Seattle police. It's unclear how the women died, but Seattle detectives have determined there are no suspects at-large.      According to Seattle police, the building manager went to a unit in the Malloy Apartments near the intersection of 15th Avenue Northeast and Northeast 43rd Street around 9:30 a.m. for a welfare check. That's when he discovered the victims.      According to Seattle fire 911 records, medics responded to 4423 15th Avenue Northeast around 9:30 a.m. The Malloy Apartments is a 123-unit building made up of mostly studio and small one-bedroom units.      The incident was originally reported as a stabbing. UW police sent out a campus-wide alert warning students to avoid the area just before 9:30 a.m.      \\"Homicide investigators are on scene and actively working to determine the circumstances of this case, and whether there are any outstanding individuals involved in this incident,\\" Seattle police wrote in a bulletin Tuesday morning.      The King County Medical Examiner will determine the cause and manner of death. There hasn't been a double-homicide in the University District in at least 10 years. There have only been five homicides in the University District since 2008, according to Seattle police crime statistics.      There have been 18 homicides in 2018 in Seattle. The last occurred on Saturday in the International District. A 56-year-old man died after he was apparently stabbed in the leg, according to Seattle police.

The Seattle Police Department said the two women were in their 20s and “there are no outstanding suspects,” indicating the deaths may have been a murder-suicide.      The department said in a written statement that officers went to the apartment at about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday after building managers found a seriously injured woman inside. Officers entered and found the two women dead and one appeared to have been stabbed.

Just two weeks later she has been found dead in her apartment along with the body of her roommate Thiti-orn Chotchuangsap.      The only daughter and youngest child in her family, Kornkamol returned home early last month to celebrate Mother’s Day on August 12 with her father and older brothers; her mother had already passed away.      Seattle police are investigating the murders of both Washington University post-graduate students.      Reports of the killings detailed how the victims’ bodies were riddled with knife wounds, causing alarm in Seattle that such a vicious act could occur in the quiet residential area close to the university and in a city regarded as one of the safest in the United States.      Kornkamol was studying law in Seattle, having graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Thammasat University and attained a master’s degree, also in law, from a university in Boston, Massachusetts.      Her family lives in Pathum Thani province, where they are well known, due to some of them being local politicians. They say Kornkamol’s ultimate goal was to one day become a judge. The only information to have emerged so far about Thiti-orn is that she was from Samut Sakhon province.      Deputy immigration police commissioner Itthipon Itthisarnronnachai said yesterday he had been notified that both bodies had been discovered on Tuesday bearing multiple stab wounds.      He declined to speculate on details surrounding the deaths, in particular on speculation in US media reports that this was a murder or murder-suicide.      The murder-suicide theory was raised following a report that the apartment was locked from the inside when a building manager went to check it at the request of Kornkamon’s family, made through their relative in the US.      Kornkamol contacted her family almost daily, so they were immediately concerned after they failed to reach her and university administration officers told them she had been absent from class for many days.      Ittipon confirmed the report that the room was locked from the inside when the building manager tried to gain entry, apparently adding substance to the theory there was nobody else involved. Moreover US police have declared that they are not seeking any suspects.      Speaking at the same press conference, Pol Lt General Suthipong Wongpin, immigration police commissioner, said immigration records showed that Kornkamol had left Thailand on August 21 and Thiti-orn on August 27.

As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies.  Please answer this question : Which gulf experiences higher swells? A:","output":"The South gulf experiences higher swells. The reason behind this lies in the differences in the geographical features of the two neighboring gulfs. The South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while the North gulf is quite deep. Both gulfs are exposed to intense wave activity throughout the year. When waves travel into areas of shallow water, such as the South gulf, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. This causes the waves to become higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. On the other hand, the North gulf is deep, which means that the waves traveling in its waters are less likely to be affected by the ocean floor and maintain their free orbital motion. This results in the waves maintaining their original shape and not turning into sharp-crested waves. As the water becomes shallower, such as in the South gulf, the swells become higher and steeper. Since the ocean bottom affects the waves more in the shallow waters, this disruption leads to larger swells. Additionally, after the wave breaks in the shallow waters, it becomes a wave of translation and the erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies. In conclusion, the South gulf, with its shallow water, experiences higher swells due to the waves being more affected by the ocean bottom. The geographical features contribute to the swell's size and shape and ultimately result in larger swells in the South gulf compared to the North gulf with its deeper waters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(AP) — Hornets owner Michael Jordan is donating 7 million to launch medical clinics that he hopes will help at-risk communities in Charlotte.      It's the largest philanthropic donation ever by the former NBA champion.      The donation will fund two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics, which are projected to open in 2020.      \\"Through my years of working with Novant Health, I have been impressed with their approach and their commitment to the community,\\" Jordan, a North Carolina native, said in a release Monday. \\"It is my hope that these clinics will help provide a brighter and healthier future for the children and families they serve.\\"      Jordan's spokesperson Estee Portnoy told The Associated Press Monday that the Hornets owner \\"feels so great about being able to impact the Charlotte community and help people who really deserve it. Michael and Novant are really excited about this project.\\"      Portnoy said Jordan, 54, was motivated by a study that found poor children in Charlotte have the worst odds of those of any of the top 50 cities in the United States to lift themselves out of poverty.      A release from Novant stated the clinics will provide an avenue to affordable, high-quality care — including behavioral health, physical therapy, social work, oral health and family planning — to individuals in the community who have little or no health care.      The clinics have the potential to decrease emergency room utilization by 68 percent and decrease hospitalization by 37 percent for the residents of these neighborhoods, according to Novant.      Novant added that the clinics are projected to care for nearly 35,000 children and adults who do not currently have access to primary and preventive care or who use the emergency room for non-urgent medical needs.      \\"This gift will transform the lives of thousands of families and children living in poverty-stricken communities,\\" said Carl Armato, president and CEO of Novant Health said. \\"We are thankful to Michael for his generosity.

Summarize: For addicts who have been consuming drugs for a long period of time, it is extra difficult for them to get over the bad habit, so they often seek medical help. There are different drugs that help in giving the same feel of weed but cause less harm to the body. These drugs help in minimizing the cravings and eventually help the person become completely sober. Nicotine medicines, patches and gums are available in stores and can be bought without prescription. Nicotine helps in making the cravings less severe and reduces feelings of irritability and headache that you might face during withdrawal.  Chewing a gum after every 2 hours when you’re awake helps in minimizing the cravings. If you are using 4 mg gums, make sure you don’t chew more than 20 gums per day or if using 3 mg, then not more than 30 pieces of gum per day. A patch should be changed after every 16 or 24 hours and the dosage you need depends on your level of addiction. It can be taken off while sleeping and put right back as soon as you wake up. It does cause a little soreness on the area it was patched so it is advisable to change areas every time. Make sure you do not completely rely on these medications (and other substances, like alcohol) as they are addictive in nature, too. The doses should be cut back with time, which will serve the right purpose of using them in the first place! These nicotine replacements should not be used if you have not completely quit smoking as the combination comes with serious problems. There are other non-nicotine medicines that are gained by prescription of a doctor. These are usually Xanax, Zyban, Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR and Wellbutrin XL and Varenicline. These medicines tell the brain to stop craving for the drug if taken in the right amount. However, they do require a prescription from your doctor.  Most of these help with depression symptoms and may cause agitation, frustration and unusual behavior at times. If you think there is a negative change (more than just a normal feeling that you might be feeling temporarily) then it is best to talk to your doctor as the dosage might not be suiting you. The process of quitting drugs comes hand in hand with major mood swings, depression and frustration. Don’t let these temporary mood disorders get you! Having low self-esteem and recoiling on yourself is normal as you have been trying to struggle against your desires. Have faith and make sure you keep reminding yourself that you are better than this. Because you are!  Talk to yourself out loud in front of the mirror and tell that image in front of you that you are a beautiful, strong person who has the strength to overcome this obstacle. And if you think you are less of a talker and more of a writer, grab a diary and start writing it all down. In fact, keep a diary of your entire process. Keep that journal someplace visible, so that you are constantly reminded of how well you are doing and thus are positively motivated to keep up the good work.  One day when you will able to come over your addiction, you will read that diary and think of all the sufferings that you have overcome with your strength. That will be one beautiful moment of pure contentment for your moral later in life or upcoming crises.","output":"Long-term drug addicts often seek medical help to combat their addiction. To minimize cravings and detoxify their bodies, they may use nicotine-based products like patches, gums, and medications that provide a similar sensation but cause less harm. It's essential to follow the recommended dosing guidelines, avoid combining these products with smoking, and gradually reduce usage over time. Additionally, non-nicotine prescription medications like Xanax, Zyban, and Wellbutrin can help rewire the brain to stop drug cravings. It's important to monitor mood changes and communicate with a doctor about potential medication side effects. Maintaining a positive mindset, practicing self-affirmation, and journaling can also help in overcoming addiction and achieving long-term success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\",  answer the following question.

Marchbank recalls that her mother was \\"amazingly optimistic\\" and reassuring about the outcome, but by by April the following year the cancer was confirmed as terminal. \\"While I was trying to come to terms with the fact she was dying, I decided I wanted, or maybe needed, to document the time she had left,\\" says Marchbank. But there was always that question as to whether it was the right thing to do. \\"I didn't want to create a graphic portrayal of her death - it would have been impossible and wrong to focus only on the dying part - but rather I wanted to photograph our last months together. \\"I looked at the things that made her uniquely her, the details in her house I thought I knew so well, the things that would also be gone when she was.\\" This is a very personal thing. Others have documented such moments, each in their own way. For some the very idea of picking up a camera at such a time would seem taboo, for others a most natural response. Marchbank feels that the few seconds spent taking pictures each day gave her a way to record the moments that would come to mean so much. \\"Her love of flowers was a beautiful part of her personality; the house was always full of them, and as I photographed them I realised they were symbolic of what was happening - they represented happiness, love, kindness and generosity, but also isolation, decay, and finally death.\\" The work is called Tulip, after her mother's favourite flower, and it is these small, often overlooked parts of her mother's life that form the narrative of the work. Marchbank found the editing process after her mother's death cathartic, and only now, five years on, is she ready to share the work with a wider audience through the publication of a book. Tulip has become about her own journey through grief. \\"Grief is like a grey cloud above your head, sometimes just a nagging doubt at the back of your mind, other times a huge storm cloud filling your whole mind. As long as I feel this grey cloud then, in a way, I will always feel her presence.\\" Tulip by Celine Marchbank is published by Dewi Lewis. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The text tells the story of Celine Marchbank, who found out in 2009 that her mother, Sue Miles, had cancer. As the cancer progressed and eventually became terminal, Marchbank decided to document their remaining time together through photography. While some may consider this approach controversial, Marchbank found solace in capturing the little details that made her mother unique, including her love of flowers. The project, titled \\"Tulip\\" after her mother's favorite flower, became a journey through grief for Marchbank. After her mother's passing, she found the process of editing the photographs cathartic. Five years later, she shares her work through the publication of a book, also titled \\"Tulip,\\" published by Dewi Lewis.

Problem:Article: NEW YORK---One in five U.S. workers regularly attends after-work drinks with coworkers, where the most common mishaps range from badmouthing another worker to drinking too much, according to a study released on Tuesday. Most workers attend so-called happy hours to bond with colleagues, although 15 percent go to hear the latest office gossip and 13 percent go because they feel necessary, said the survey conducted for CareerBuilder. com, an online job site. As to what happens when the after-work drinks flow, 16 percent reported bad-mouthing a colleague, 10 percent shared a secret about a colleague and 8 percent said they drank too much and acted unprofessionally. Five percent said they had shared a secret about the company, and 4 percent confessed to singing karaoke. While 21 percent of those who attended said happy hours were good for networking, 85 percent said attending had not helped them get closer to someone higher up or get a better position. An equal number of men and women said they attended happy hours with co-workers, with younger workers aged 25 to 34 most likely and workers over 55 least likely to attend. Overall, 21 percent of workers attend happy hours with co-workers and of those nearly a quarter go at least once a month. The survey was conducted online by Harris Interactive on behalf of CareerBuilder. Com among 6,987 full-time employees between February 11 and March 13. Harris Interactive said the results had a sampling error of plus or minus 1.2 percentage points.

Answer:","output":"[+] Look at how many miles you must fly before you can redeem them for a free flight. Choose an airline that doesn't require flying more miles than other airlines. The correct answer is to look at how many miles you need to fly before you can redeem them for free flights and choose an airline that doesn't require flying more miles than others. This helps you get free flights more easily and quickly because you won't need as many miles. The other answers are wrong because: Visiting the website of your nearest airline for an easy fee doesn't have anything to do with finding an airline with a good frequent flier program. Asking your attendant for a ticket based on opportunity doesn't help you choose a good frequent flier program. You want to choose an airline with a good program so you earn miles quickly and can redeem them easily. Picking an airline that allows you to stay overnight and is as busy as other airports doesn't really make sense for choosing a good frequent flier program. It's better to focus on how many miles you need to fly to get free flights and stick with one airline to earn miles quickly."},{"instruction":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"I love it. Very good\\" A:","output":"★★★★★"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If the interviewer uses your name throughout the interview, this can be a positive sign. Not only does this show that the interviewer has taken the time to learn your name, but it also indicates a friendly and positive rapport.  If you notice that the interviewer is not using your name, you may find ways to remind them. For instance, if you are asked a question concerning one of your personal shortcomings, you can say something like: \\"My former supervisor would always say, 'Katie, your perfectionism is both a blessing and a curse.\\" Reminding them of your name may help the memory of you to stick. One great sign that they’d like to bring you on board is if they show you around the office and introduce you to the team. They wouldn’t waste their employees' time by introducing them to someone who wasn’t a serious contender. At the same time, they may be looking to get the employees’ opinions on you. So know that this is a great sign, but keep your game face on.  Aim for a jovial, yet professional tone. It is a very good sign to be meeting the team; go ahead and let your excitement show. Does it feel as if your interviewer is just robotically moving down a list of questions? Does this interview feel entirely scripted? Although most interviews will have an underlying script, if an interview is going well, it is likely you’ll move off the grid. If an interview feels very scripted, or if it seems like your interviewer is simply going through the motions, this can be a negative sign.  If your interviewer is going through the motions, try to engage them and help snap them into the moment. Keep in mind that interviews can be performed by a variety of different people, some of whom may not be comfortable in doing interviews, so they rely heavily on the script. Some methods for achieving this include: making a tasteful joke, engaging in direct eye contact, and calling your interviewer by name. Any of these (or other methods you may come up with) might break the monotony for your interviewer and cause you to stand out. Examples of good body language include things like nodding the head or leaning in towards you slightly. A nice strong handshake can also be a good sign. Look for instances of positive body language from your interviewer, as this can indicate how they feel about you.  Be aware of your own body language! People tend to mirror each other so smile, speak softly and clearly, and project enthusiasm. Keep eye contact even if the interviewer turns away. Use positive body language toward your interviewer to indicate that you like them, and that you are truly interested in the job. Most interviews will involve some form of \\"Q and A\\" section, where they ask invite you to ask any questions you have, and then answer them. If your interviewer spends a lot of time and energy on this section (and if they seem invested), this indicates that they want to sell you on the job. This can be a good sign.  Of course, in order for this work, you must have plenty of questions! Spend some time preparing questions before you head to your interview. You will want to ask questions about the job, the requirements and expectations, the company, the atmosphere and people, and finally, when they will be making a decision. Through your questions, show that you are already know a thing or two about the job and company, as well as the fact that you are invested in making sure this is a good fit. Summary:","output":"This article talks about different signs during a job interview that can help you understand if the interviewer likes you and if you have a good chance of getting the job, like using your name, introducing you to the team, or having a friendly conversation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: How are members chosen for the US Congress? Context: In 1864, Andrew Johnson (a War Democrat from Tennessee) was elected Vice President under Abraham Lincoln. He became President after Lincoln's assassination in 1865. Under Johnson's lenient re-admission policy, Tennessee was the first of the seceding states to have its elected members readmitted to the U.S. Congress, on July 24, 1866. Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period. The answer to this question is:","output":"Members for the US Congress are chosen through elections. In the given context, Tennessee had its elected members readmitted to the U.S. Congress on July 24, 1866, after ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment and following President Johnson's lenient re-admission policy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?  - no - yes","output":"The rate of diffusion is the measure of how quickly particles or substances move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This process tends to occur spontaneously in nature and plays a crucial role in various fields like biology, chemistry, and physics. The rate of molecular diffusion is typically quantified through the diffusion coefficient, which is a proportionality constant that depends on the properties of the substance and the environment it is in, like temperature and viscosity. The units of the diffusion coefficient are generally expressed in square centimeters per second (cm²/s) or square meters per second (m²/s). Fick's first law is commonly used to model the diffusion process, with the equation: J = -D * (dC/dx), where J represents the rate of diffusion (flux), D is the diffusion coefficient, and (dC/dx) refers to the concentration gradient, Several factors influence the rate of diffusion, including: 1. Concentration gradient: The steeper the concentration gradient, the faster the rate of diffusion. 2. Temperature: Higher temperatures lead to increased kinetic energy in the particles, thereby increasing the rate of diffusion. 3. Molecular size: Smaller molecules tend to diffuse more rapidly than larger molecules because they can move through tighter spaces at a faster rate. 4. Medium in which diffusion occurs: The rate of diffusion is generally faster in gases than in liquids due to the greater distances between gas particles, allowing them to move more freely. 5. Viscosity: The greater the viscosity of a substance, the slower the rate of diffusion. 6. Surface area: Larger surfaces facilitate faster diffusion rates. 7. Diffusion and solubility properties of interacting substances: Some substances diffuse more readily within specific media or with other specific substances. The rate of molecular diffusion is considered low because it is an inherently slow process compared to other methods of substance transport. Since it depends on the random and passive movement of individual molecules, it does not involve any additional energy input or external forces, making it rely solely on molecular collisions and the concentration gradient. Diffusion is generally best-suited for short distances and smaller systems; in larger systems, other transportation mechanisms may come into play, such as active transport and bulk flow, to facilitate movement across more considerable distances. Regarding the multi-choice problem: the two questions are inquiring about related but distinct aspects of the same topic. The first question seeks to define the rate of diffusion, while the second question aims to understand why the rate of molecular diffusion is low. So, the answer is \\"no\\" - they are not inquiring about the same information, although they are closely connected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The small-statured pony, with his speckled coat, somehow found a kindred spirit in the large and imposing canine, Joker, who too sported a similar patchy pattern on his body. And it was not just their black and white markings that were identical, their personalities shared the same playful energy too. The two animals who are both incredibly boisterous and lively have since become inseparable. They gambol, trot, run around together and shares naps under the warm Cornwall sun, a picture of pure joy and harmony. So much so that it often becomes difficult to identify where Tigger ends and Joker begins and vice versa, their markings sometimes creating an illusion of continuity.  Their odd friendship took everyone by surprise but the bond was unmistakable. Despite the difference in species, the heartening sight resembles close-knit siblings, never leaving each other's side. Tigger, who is older and wiser, has taken it upon himself to guide Joker, teaching him the ways of the animal kingdom. Joker, on the other hand, brings to Tigger a youthful exuberance and together, they balance each other's idiosyncrasies perfectly.  Their relationship never goes unnoticed by visitors at the stables. People from the surrounding areas traveling to see the unusual pair are usually filled with amusement and surprise. Their bond seems to transcend the conventional understanding of friendship, it's their unique language of love and bond that only the two seem to understand.  \\"Joker and Tigger are the best mates. They're always playing and running around together, it's adorable,\\" their beloved owner, Jones mentions with a glow of pride in her eyes.

Their evenings were spent sharing food, warming up to each other, and gazing at the same blanket of the night sky. The friendship of Joker and Tigger truly reflects that relationships are not bound by species but are fostered by the love, respect, and companionship they offer each other.

Heartbroken, the child rushes up to the attic and cuts his hand with a shard of glass from a shattered snow globe. Thirty-three years later, an adult Harry (Brandon Maggart) now works in a low-level position at the Jolly Dreams toy factory. At home, he has taken it upon himself to become the next true Santa: he sleeps in costume, and his apartment is resplendent with Christmas toys and dÃ©cor. From the roof of his building, he uses binoculars to spy on neighborhood children to see if they are being \\"bad or good\\". He sees two \\"good\\" children doing household chores and playing with their dolls, but finds a third child, Moss Garcia, rifling through a Penthouse magazine and cutting out a nude photograph. Harry runs back home and writes Moss's name in his \\"Bad Boys &amp; Girls\\" book. On his way home, Harry peeps into the window of a local bar and sees coworker Frank Stoller, who earlier that day had phoned in sick, requiring Harry to take his place on the assembly line. Harry becomes angry and rushes home, hums a Christmas tune, and breaks one of his male dollhouse figures. The following morning he phones his younger brother Phil (Jeffrey DeMunn) and cancels Thanksgiving dinner. At the company Christmas party, the owner of Jolly Dreams announces that, if production increases sufficiently, the company will be able to donate toys to the disadvantaged children at Willowy Springs State Hospital. Afterwards, Harry is greeted by coworkers Ben, who thanks him for taking Frank's place at the warehouse, and Frank, who introduces him to new employee George.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: In Uttar Pradesh, a special police squad has been set up to fight eve teasing - a local term for sexual harassment. But the move has led to allegations of moral policing. The BBC's Vikas Pandey spent a day with the squad in Allahabad city. In a public park, a young couple try to hide as they spot the squad. \\"Please come out. We are here for your safety,\\" Niraj Kumar Jadaun, assistant superintendent of police and head of the squad, tells them. The boy emerges and asks for forgiveness, only to be reassured by Mr Jadaun that he has done nothing wrong. After a brief conversation, the couple manage a faint smile before disappearing into the park. \\"Some people are scared of cops. And that's the perception we have to fight against,\\" he says. \\"But eve teasing is another reality that we need to fight against.\\" Police in Uttar Pradesh established the squad due to rising reports of sexual harassment. There are no reliable statistics and police say that in most cases women don't report harassment. But most women have a story, or several, to tell about inappropriate or abusive groping, language or behaviour. A total of 1,400 officers have been deployed to anti-harassment squads across the state. Each squad includes three uniformed officers and a female officer in plain clothes. They patrol in cars and on foot, targeting areas where they get most complaints about harassment. So far there have been mixed results. Some squads have made headlines for \\"moral policing\\" and there have been reports of couples being harassed and even beaten up. But Rahul Srivastava, chief spokesperson of the police, said that only \\"a handful\\" of officers were making mistakes. \\"We are repeatedly training our staff about the dos and don'ts,\\" he said. \\"We have suspended nine officials so far for violations. Our instruction is clear that consenting adults should not be disturbed.\\" Mr Jadaun says upbringing can be to blame. \\"In some cultures it's still a taboo for a boy and a girl to sit together in public places. So some cops who think on similar lines end up indulging in moral policing,\\" he says. \\"But their number is very small.\\" Back in the park, Mr Jadaun is stopped by a young man who wants to talk. \\"My name is Abhilash Denis and I want to thank you for this initiative. But I also have some issues,\\" he says. Mr Denis says that he likes to go to public parks with his girlfriend. \\"But it's always a risk. Eve teasers are always around. They make nasty remarks and make rude gestures. The squad's presence has made sure that such people are less visible in public places,\\" he says. \\"But that doesn't mean that cops have a right to disturb us any time.\\" Mr Jadaun assures him that police will only disturb him to ask about their safety. Elsewhere in the park a woman, who didn't want to be identified, seems angry with the police. \\"It's the police's responsibility to make us feel safe. But I don't want random police to question me just because I am sitting in a public place with my male friend,\\" she says. \\"Yes, I agree that eve teasing is a problem. And I am happy the police are doing something about it. But they need to get better at what they do.\\" In another part of the city, police approach two couples sitting on a bench. Kritika Singh says she appreciates the work the police are doing, and didn't mind having a conversation with them. \\"You have to know how big a problem eve teasing is in this state. Every girl can tell you horrific incidents they have faced in public places,\\" she says. \\"Abuse, filthy gestures from men are very common. Sometimes they also end up touching us inappropriately in public places.\\" Her friend Sadhna Maurya agrees. \\"I have seen reports about moral policing and that must stop. But the squad should not be shut. I have seen it making a difference. We feel a bit safer now, though not 100%.\\" She says she has grown up accepting harassment as a reality. \\"For the first time something is being done, I am willing to accept it despite its imperfections.\\" I witnessed similar conversations between the squad and people across the city. We stopped at schools, malls and shopping districts. The squad questions many men, but nobody is detained. \\"Our purpose is not to arrest people. We want eve teasers to know that the police are out there to catch them. We want them to change,\\" Mr Jadaun says. As the day finishes, the jury still seems to be out on whether the initiative is a success. In some places people, mostly women, appreciated the squad's work. But some still have doubts about its methods. I put this question to the state's top police official, Javeed Ahmed. \\"Eve teasing is a reality,\\" he said. \\"We needed to send a signal that women would be protected and people who harassed them would be dealt with in a strict manner.\\" He acknowledges that there is a long way to go. \\"But I am glad we have made a start,\\" he says. \\"We can't become a progressive state if women don't feel safe here.\\" Back at base, the squad hold a briefing to go over the day's events. Superintendent of Police Vipin Tada says it is a chance to identify mistakes. \\"They are learning fast. Just remember it's a new initiative for them as well,\\" he says. Allahabad's top police officer Shalabh Kumar Mathur says he does not regret putting resources into this initiative. \\"Eve teasing is a menace. If the choice is between doing nothing and doing something with scope for improvement, I would pick the latter,\\" he says.","output":"Police in Uttar Pradesh have established a special squad to address the issue of eve teasing, a local term for sexual harassment. A total of 1,400 officers have been deployed to patrol areas with high levels of complaints about harassment.

Black hole jets recycle matter and energy into space and can affect when and where a galaxy forms stars. “Jets from supermassive black holes help determine a galaxy’s fate — how it evolves,” said Tasso Tzioumis from CSIRO in Australia. “So we want to understand better the impact jets have on their environment.”            Astronomers have known for decades that black hole jets contain electrons, which are low-mass particles. But using the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton space telescope and CSIRO’s Compact Array radio telescope in eastern Australia, the research team found the first evidence of heavy atoms — iron and nickel — in the jets from a typical black hole known as 4U1630-47.            An iron atom is about 100,000 times more massive than an electron. When a massive particle is moving, it carries more energy than a lighter particle moving at the same speed. “Heavy atoms have been seen in jets from one other system, SS433, but that’s a very unusual system, an oddball, whereas this system is quite typical, much more likely to represent black holes in general,” Tzioumis said. While 4U1630-47 is a small black hole, a few times the mass of the Sun, the physics of black holes is scalable, he said, meaning that the finding would apply to larger black holes.            The discovery suggests that jets are powered by the black hole’s accretion disk — a belt of hot gas swirling around the black hole — and not by the spin of the black hole itself, which would be more likely to produce jets containing only light particles. The jets from 4U1630-47 are traveling fast, at two-thirds the speed of light. When such fast-moving jets containing heavy particles smash into matter in space, they could generate gamma rays and neutrinos, which might be detectable with current and future telescopes.       ||||| Has a black hole mystery just been solved?      Writing in the journal Nature, a team of scientists said it found traces of nickel and iron in the powerful jets shooting out of black hole candidate 4U 1630-47, a small black hole just a few times the mass of our sun. It may help solve a scientific puzzle that has lingered for decades.      Astronomers have known for years that hyper-dense black holes shoot matter into the universe in high-speed streams known as relativistic jets. However, nobody knew exactly what type of material the jets were spewing.      \\"It was one of the unsolved questions about relativistic jets produced in the vicinity of black holes,\\" said Avi Loeb, chair of the department of astronomy at Harvard University, who was not involved with the study. \\"What is their composition?\\"      Everyone was in agreement that the jets would contain electrons, which have a negative charge. But the jets did not have a negative charge overall. That suggested there was something else in there with a positive charge that canceled it out.      In addition, some models of the jets suggested they were shooting lightweight electrons and positrons away from the black hole and into the universe. Others thought the jets were made of much heavier normal matter.      \\"Until now, it wasn't clear whether the positive charge came from positrons, the antimatter 'opposite' of electrons, or positively charged atoms,\\" study coauthor James Miller-Jones of the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research said in a statement. \\"Since our results found nickel and iron in these jets, we now know that ordinary matter must be providing the positive charge.\\"      Because it takes a lot more energy to move normal matter than it would to move the lightweight electrons and positrons, the authors suggests that the high-speed jets are carrying more energy away from the black hole than was previously known.      The study also sheds light on another scientific debate - exactly where the jets emerge from. It has been unclear whether the jets are caused by the spin of the rotating black hole, or if they originate from the disk of matter that surrounds the black hole.      \\"Our results suggest it's more likely the disk is responsible for channeling the matter into the jets, and we are planning further observations to try and confirm this,\\" Miller-Jones said in the statement.      To come to these conclusions, the researchers looked at both radio waves and X-rays that were emitted by black hole 4U 1630-47.      The first time they looked, the radio wave spectrum suggested the jets were not on, and the X-ray spectrum did not reveal anything unusual.      \\"The jets are not always on,\\" Miller-Jones told the Los Angeles Times. \\"It depends a little bit on how fast the black hole is feeding.\\"      But the second time the team looked, the radio waves seemed to indicate the jets were on. At the same time, the X-ray spectrum picked up the characteristic signature of iron and nickel that was off just a bit.      The scientists believe the signatures were slightly skewed because of a Doppler-like effect in space.      \\"Just like a sound wave gets higher as it moves toward you and lower as it moves away from you, we saw the same effect,\\" Miller-Jones said. \\"The energy was shifted a little bit to higher energies when it was moving toward us, and lower when it was moving away from us.\\"      One especially cool result of this effect is that it allowed the researchers to determine how fast the material in the jets were moving. Their finding? A whopping 123,000 miles per second, or about 66% of the speed of light.      You read to the end? You are awesome! Follow me on Twitter for more like this.

Question: Who hires American private detective Alvin MacCarron to investigate Dickie's disappearance? Title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt.

Q:Article: Many cities have subways and underground public transportation to take locals and tourists alike rapidly around the city.However, there's something different about riding a London subway.It may not look different, but the historical value of one of England's most popular forms of transportation is enough to make riding the subway a must when visiting London.With a little under 300 different stations, the subway can take you almost anywhere you need to go. Riding a London subway, a person from other countries will notice one major difference: in London, people do not look at each other.In fact, eye contact is avoided at all times.That's not rudeness --people are just too busy to bother looking. Busy doing what, you ask? Well, they're certainly not using the time for a moment of quiet thinking.Nor are they reading a book.New technology has replaced quiet habits.Today the only acceptable form of book on the London underground is an e-book. Apple must earn a fortune from London commuters .Since the launch of the iPhone in 2007, over 40,000--yes, that's 40,000 \\" _ \\" have been designed.

Write some highlights for the following article: The Spanish League will decide Tuesday afternoon if they are going to take action against Barcelona supporters singing ‘Ronaldo is a drunk’ at the Camp Nou on Sunday night. The League have officials at every La Liga match and the one at Barcelona’s meeting with Levante at the weekend included hearing the song in their report. If the Spanish League reports it to the Antiviolence Committee Barcelona could be fined or even have a part of the Nou Camp closed. The steps being considered are a result of Spanish football’s intention of cutting out all forms of crowd trouble or incitement to crowd trouble since a Deportivo supporter was killed in a pitched battle before a match at Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon stadium in November. Barcelona fans chanted 'Ronaldo is a drunk' about Real Madrid star Cristiano at the Nou Camp. Barcelona could now face disciplinary action from the Spanish league. Pictured is their star man Lionel Messi. Despite what some might term 'terrace banter' appearing to have little to do with the organised violence that ended with a supporter being beaten to death outside a stadium last year, the football authorities have included chants and songs in their crackdown on trouble. Barca fan taunts followed Ronaldo’s 30th birthday party when he was videoed and photographed celebrating after a 4-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid. The league threatened similar action for sections of the Bernabeu chanting ‘Messi is retarded’ in December but none was taken. Real Madrid, however, were reported to have identified the 17 supporters who started the chant and expelled them. Ronaldo (right) sings alongside Colombian singer Kevin Roldan at his 30th birthday party. James Rodriguez, Roldan and  Ronaldo celebrates the Portuguese's 30th birthday earlier this month. In the past abuse of a racist nature aimed at players has gone unpunished in Spain with Dani Alves, Samuel Eto’o and Ashley Cole on international duty for England at the Bernabeu in 2004 all victims. The apparently frivolous nature of the song aimed at Ronaldo mean any serious punishment is likely to be met with ridicule outside of Spain. But with the Real Madrid v Barcelona rivalry colouring all La Liga debate there will be no shortage of Real Madrid supporters keen for the League to carry through on its threat. Highlights:","output":"- Some Barcelona fans sang a mean song about a famous soccer player from another team named Ronaldo, calling him a \\"drunk\\". - The Spanish League, which takes care of the soccer games, will decide if any actions need to be taken against these fans. - If they decide these actions were not nice, Barcelona's soccer team could get a fine or have a part of their soccer field closed. - Spanish soccer wants to make sure everyone behaves well during games and doesn't cause trouble."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: A woman whose car flipped 500 yards down a remote ravine in northern California was rescued today after her family reported her missing. And her rescue was enabled in part thanks to a quick-thinking police officer.      Melissa Vasquez was ejected from her vehicle after she crashed in the mountains near San Jose, about twenty miles from where she lives in Campbell, California, police said. Campbell police were alerted of a possible crash on Monday by the car's on-board OnStar security system, but couldn't locate the woman's vehicle, police said.      \\"During the investigation, one of our officers asked her stepmom about her iPhone,\\" Sgt. Gary Berg told ABC News today. \\"So the officer logged on to the Find My iPhone app and unbelievably he was able to guess her password and log into her account. And at that point, he located the address where her phone was showing on GPS.\\"      California Highway Patrol brought in a helicopter and pulled the woman to safety today. She had been ejected from her car and was laying face down in the ravine, police said.      It's not yet clear how the accident happened, and police are investigating. Vasquez, 28, is being treated for injuries at a hospital, police said.      \\"It's pretty remarkable,\\" Berg said. \\"I would hate to think of the outcome had we not been able to log on.\\"      OnStar told ABC News it is aware of the incident and looking into what happened.      \\"We are saddened by this incident involving one of our subscribers,\\" the company said in a statement. \\"Our subscribers' safety and security is OnStar's utmost concern. We are currently conducting a complete investigation, including information we have received from our call centers, our cellular network provider, our engineering team and the local authorities to better understand what occurred.\\" ||||| A California car crash victim was impossible to find until a tech-savvy police officer made a crucial decision to track her down using an iPhone.California Highway Patrol officers located the missing woman's Chevy Cruze at about 5:30 Tuesday morning. The missing car was 500 feet down a ravine off Mt. Hamilton Road in South Bay.A Coast Guard helicopter was called while officers walked down the embankment through heavy shrubbery. They found 28-year-old Melissa Vasquez, who had been ejected from the car, and had been missing for 17 hours.\\"The officers on the scene said she was face down. She was awake, coherent, and she was speaking to officers,\\" explained CHP Officer Ross Lee.Rescuers put Vasquez into an airlift basket and the chopper hoisted her out of the ravine. She was in the ICU after suffering injuries to her legs and her abdomen.The CHP says they're still investigating the incident and they don't know why the car ended up in the ravine. Drugs and alcohol, they say, do not appear to be a factor.But the real detective work began sometime after 2 p.m. on Monday, when the car's OnStar program detected a crash after two of the tires were ripped off the car. OnStar monitors told Campbell police the car was at Highway 17 and Camden Avenue, near Vasquez' home. Officers responded, but police heard and saw nothing. OnStar later updated the location to downtown San Jose. Again, police found nothing.At 3 a.m. Tuesday, Vasquez's stepmother called police, saying her daughter was missing.The officer credited with finding her is back on the job after a very busy morning.\\"I'm kind of known around the department as kind of a tech geek,\\" Campbell police Officer David Cameron said.Cameron is a shy and humble man. He spoke for the first time on Tuesday about his crucial role in finding Vasquez.It wasn't until 3 a.m. Tuesday when Cameron went to Vasquez's house and found her iPad that he realized he could use Apple's Find My iPhone app to track her. But first, he had to crack all of her pass codes.\\"I made an educated guess based on a series of common numbers people use for passwords and on the third attempt I was able to get in,\\" Cameron said.Then he remotely turned on her phone's location finder. Vasquez meantime, was miles away, thrown from her car, lying face down and hurt. In just minutes, Cameron had a read on her location and just 20 minutes later rescuers were lifting her into a U.S. Coast Guard chopper.\\"I think somebody was looking out for her. Things fell in place and had those things not fallen in place, it could have been a totally different story,\\" Cameron said.At Regional Medical Center, Vasquez family rushed to her side and made an emotional plea.\\"We would ask for prayers and ask that you respect the family's privacy,\\" Stephanie Valdez, Melissa's cousin, said.Cameron plans to visit Melissa in a few days.Meantime, OnStar says its investigating why the system failed.Apple does not market the find my iPhone feature to police, but it has been used hundreds of times by officers to find stolen devices and this may be the first time it's been used to save someone's life.If you have an apple device -- an iPhone, iPad or a Mac -- you can use the Find My iPhone feature to locate your device on a map. It'll even play a sound so you can track it down. And if you think your phone was stolen or lost, you can lock it and then track it. Or just erase all the information on the phone. All you have to do is log into your iCloud account and activate the app. ||||| A 28-year-old woman from Campbell whose car tumbled hundreds of feet down an embankment on Mount Hamilton east of San Jose was rescued and taken to a hospital Tuesday morning after she spent more than 12 hours stuck and injured, officials said.      In the end, police said, the search for where the car crashed was both complicated and aided by location-based technology.      On Monday afternoon, just after 2 p.m., Campbell police officers received a report from General Motors’ OnStar system saying there had been a rollover accident involving Melissa Vasquez’s Chevrolet Cruze in the area of White Oaks Road and Shelley Avenue in Campbell, said Capt. Gary Berg.      That was just a couple of blocks from the woman’s home.      Officers spent two hours searching the area, Berg said. But the pegged location wasn’t right. Police had OnStar honk the car horn remotely, to no avail. A second strategy — having officers run sirens in different locations to see if they could be heard over the OnStar system — also failed.      A knock on Vasquez’s door got no response. And the car wasn’t there.      Officers then contacted Vasquez’s cell company, which provided a location of her phone within a 7-mile radius of downtown San Jose, Berg said. Authorities were still unable to locate the car. Campbell police officers broadcast the vehicle’s description to all agencies in the county, he said.      Then, just before 3 a.m. Tuesday, Campbell police officers received a missing person’s report from Vasquez’s stepmother, with whom she lives, officials said. She said she hadn’t heard from her.      Officer Dave Cameron met with the stepmother and asked if Vasquez had Find My iPhone, an app that allows you to locate your misplaced iPhone using cell signals. The stepmother responded that Vasquez owned an iPad — but she didn’t know where it was.      So Cameron called the cell company, which could tell the iPad was in the Campbell home. Soon, the stepmother found the tablet computer — but it was locked.      “So I made an educated guess, based on a series of common numbers people use for passwords,�? Cameron told reporters. Cameron is a SWAT team member and accident reconstruction specialist but acknowledged that he’s known within the department as “kind of a tech geek.�?      “Amazingly, Officer Cameron was able to guess the correct password after only 3-4 tries using his knowledge of commonly used password combinations,�? officials said.      The Find my iPhone app was also locked. But the same password opened it up. Cameron activated the “lost phone�? feature and saw a map of the location of Vasquez’s iPhone — 14555 Mount Hamilton Rd.      “It gave a very small search area,�? Cameron said. He noticed that Vasquez’s cell phone only had 12 percent battery life left.      “You think about it. If we didn’t have that specific location I would hate to think what the outcome would be without him logging into that account,�? Berg said.      Officers from San Jose and deputies from Santa Clara County responded to the area soon after receiving the information from Campbell police.      Less than 20 minutes later, at around 5:30 a.m., officers located Vasquez on Mount Hamilton. The car, which had plummeted about 500 yards off an embankment, was on its roof, said California Highway Patrol Officer Ross Lee. The victim was outside the car, face-down but conscious.      A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter responded and airlifted Vasquez to Regional Medical Center of San Jose with major injuries, including to her abdomen and legs. She is expected to survive, Ross said. Relieved family members met with Vasquez at the hospital and thanked rescuers.      General Motors said in a statement Tuesday that it was looking into what happened with the OnStar system and was “saddened by this incident involving one of our subscribers.�?      “Our subscribers’ safety and security is OnStar’s utmost concern. We are currently conducting a complete investigation, including information we have received from our call centers, our cellular network provider, our engineering team and the local authorities to better understand what occurred,�? the company said.      Cameron said he was heartened that the technology that was available helped save Vasquez.      “Sixteen years ago, that wouldn’t have happened,�? he said. “It would have been phone calls and guesses and maps.�?

Lee and Demian Bulwa contributed to this blog post. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Melissa Vasquez, a 28-year-old woman from California, was rescued after her car flipped 500 yards down a remote ravine in northern California.

The statement refers to the fact that certain substances can pose significant dangers to both human health and the environment. The Greens, in this case, are a political party focusing on environmental and social issues, advocating for a more sustainable, ecologically responsible approach to governance.  The individual expressing this opinion agrees with the Greens' goal of accelerating efforts to address the risks associated with hazardous substances. These substances can include chemicals used in various industries, such as agriculture, manufacturing, or pharmaceuticals. The dangers associated with these substances can range widely from being toxic, causing illness, or leading to other negative impacts on the environment and human health. To move forward more quickly on tackling this issue, it is essential to consider various approaches, such as: 1. Stricter regulations: Implementing tighter regulations on the production, use, and disposal of hazardous substances can help reduce their negative impact. This can include requiring companies to undergo comprehensive risk assessments and establishing limitations on the amounts of specific chemicals released into the environment. 2. Promoting safer alternatives: Encouraging the development and use of safer alternatives to hazardous substances is vital for reducing the harm they cause. This can involve supporting research into new materials and processes that function more sustainably while providing incentives for industries to adopt these alternatives. 3. Expanding monitoring and enforcement efforts: Ensuring that companies and individuals adhere to existing regulations is crucial, which requires strengthening monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. This can be achieved by increasing funding for governmental agencies responsible for overseeing compliance and imposing stricter penalties for those who violate the regulations. 4. Raising public awareness: Educating the public about the dangers posed by hazardous substances and how they can reduce their exposure is an essential component of minimizing their harmful effects. This can be done through targeted campaigns, educational programs, and promoting transparency in industries that use these substances. 5. International cooperation: Collaborating with other countries in the monitoring, regulation, and development of alternatives to hazardous substances can significantly increase the impact of efforts to address this issue. Working together, countries can establish international standards, share resources and information, and help support one another in their goals. In conclusion, there are various approaches to addressing the dangers that hazardous substances pose. By sharing the Greens' desire to move forward more quickly in this area, individuals and governments can build upon these ideas to develop more sustainable solutions and protect human health and the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Beijing's broadened ban on smoking in public places took effect Thursday, adding force to the effort to hold a smoke-free Olympics. The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday. Everyone has the right to dissuade people from smoking in public places, Liu Zejun, who works for the Beijing committee, said. \\"Citizens are encouraged to expose those who refuse to obey the rule by calling the free telephone line 12320,\\" Liu said. People caught smoking in forbidden areas will be fined 10 yuan (1.40), while enterprises and institutions that violate  the ban will face fines of between 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan.

Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Hard to Believe Review: I find the whole circumstances of the story unbelievable. Abigail is a beautiful 25 year old spinster. However, the reason she never wed and had a chance to find a husband is because she is busy taking care of her younger sister, Caroline, after their mother died. The age difference between the 2 sisters were only 8 years apart. That is just too small of an age gap to make it believable that Abigail is able to take care of Caroline. Also, their older brother, who is still alive, is a lord of the realm, therefore, I believe there are no financial hardship in hiring a governess, nanny, housekeeper, etc. Also 25 years old just doesn't seem that old by today's standard. The book keep going on and on about her being a 25 years old spinster. I just have a hard time overcoming the unbelievable circumstances of the story.It would be a different matter if Abigail is approaching 40. I would find that more believable. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review can be interpreted as mostly negative. From the beginning, the reviewer expresses their disbelief in the story's circumstances, focusing on the protagonist Abigail's age and perceived incompetence in taking care of her younger sister due to the small age gap between them. The reviewer also questions the need for Abigail to be the sole caretaker, given their older brother's status as a lord and the assumed lack of financial hardship in hiring help. The tone continues to emphasize disbelief as the reviewer comments on the book's insistence on referring to Abigail as a 25-year-old spinster, which they deem unrealistic by today's standards. They suggest that the narrative would be more believable if Abigail was closer to 40 years old.  Overall, the reviewer's focus on the implausibility of certain aspects of the story and their dissatisfaction with the book's portrayal of the protagonist contribute to a negative tone in this product review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process: - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born.  Question: suppose there is not much water free happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"A lack of water can have a significant impact on the life cycle of butterflies, specifically affecting their population and growth. The perturbation you mentioned is related to the second effect – the caterpillar eating constantly until it grows bigger. Less water availability can lead to the following effects on butterflies: 1. Decreased plant growth: Caterpillars feed primarily on plant leaves. With less water, plants may struggle to grow and thrive, leading to a reduced food source for caterpillars. This could result in slower growth and development of the caterpillars, potentially affecting their ability to reach their full size before forming a cocoon. 2. Reduced survival rates: Water is essential for the survival of living organisms. It assists in regulating body temperature, digestion, and nutrient absorption, among other vital functions. A lack of water may directly impact the survival of caterpillars or lead to dehydration and weaken their immune systems, making them more susceptible to diseases or predation. 3. Hindered egg-laying: Adult butterflies rely on water for their survival and reproduction. A scarcity of water may negatively affect their ability to reproduce, resulting in fewer eggs being laid and, consequently, fewer caterpillars born. This further decreases the butterfly population. 4. Altered behavior: Water scarcity can lead to behavioral changes in butterflies, such as increased movement in search of water and limited time available for feeding. This can also affect their growth and ability to form cocoons on time. In conclusion, a lack of water would likely have a negative effect on the growth and development of caterpillars, leading to less optimal conditions for their survival and cocoon formation. As a result, there may be fewer butterflies in such an environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Q:Information:  - In information theory , Shannon 's source coding theorem ( or noiseless coding theorem ) establishes the limits to possible data compression , and the operational meaning of the Shannon entropy . The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet .  - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services.  - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968.  - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on  or to heat  the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.  - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant :  - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.  - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K).  - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon.  - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation.  - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:,  + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally,  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection.  - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.  - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics.  - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.    What entity does 'shannon's source coding theorem' has the relation 'named after' with?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More animal farming increases pollution happens, how will it affect Trees grow bigger.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more animal farming increasing pollution can have a direct and indirect effect on the process of trees growing bigger. Direct effects: 1. Increased pollution from animal farming can lead to higher concentrations of harmful gases like nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and methane in the atmosphere. This can cause acid rains, which can damage the leaves of trees and hinder the photosynthesis process, affecting tree growth. 2. An increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere can actually boost photosynthesis in trees (up to a certain limit). However, the extra CO2 in the atmosphere can also contribute to global warming, which can negatively affect tree growth in the long term due to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. Indirect effects: 1. Animal farming can lead to land-use changes, such as deforestation, to make space for more farms and grazing areas. This directly reduces the number of trees available to grow bigger. 2. Water pollution caused by animal farming can impact trees too. If the water used by trees is polluted with contaminants like nitrates and phosphates from animal waste, it can affect the trees' ability to absorb and transport water efficiently, hindering their growth. 3. The groundwater table may get affected due to the excess withdrawal of water for animal farming activities, which will also have a negative impact on the growth of trees in that area. In conclusion, while an increase in atmospheric CO2 levels could theoretically boost photosynthesis, overall, the negative direct and indirect effects of more animal farming and pollution are likely to outweigh the potential benefits for tree growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation. The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding, cold welding, vacuum packing and vacuum frying. Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings, and to surface science. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles. Deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying, adhesive preparation, distillation, metallurgy, and process purging.

Now, almost everybody knows it. \\"Almost every day, I take a photo of myself at school, and save it in my Qzone (QQ),\\" said Huang Xu, 13, from Hunan. These photos record her happy and sad moments. Pop stars also take a lot of selfies. Li Chunping, 14, from Harbin, is a big fan of Yang Mi. \\"She has used many selfies to tell us what's going on in her personal life,\\" said Li. What makes people love selfies? Some people say it's narcissism  . \\"The rise of the selfie is a perfect symbol for our narcissistic culture. We're crying out: Look at me!\\" said US psychiatrist  Carole Lieberman. Young people are using selfies to make friends online, Jonathan Freedland wrote in The Guardian. \\"The usual purpose of taking a selfie is to share online. They express a human need to connect with others,\\" wrote Freedland. Huang Xu agrees with that. \\"During summer vacation, my classmates and I shared many selfies online. Hair or clothes were not our interests. Through these photos, we got to know each other's holidays and feelings,\\" said Huang Xu. Question: What is the best title of this passage ?

It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men. After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western. Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it's just life. And we're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor's nobility intact. But that's if Bonanza were done today. But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality, but all came together in a pinch. The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys. Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that.  Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show. Rumor has it he didn't care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. Perhaps if it were done now, he'd have liked it better in the way I describe. This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights.  When Roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons, but when big Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added on by that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family. So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look anything like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits, is the Cartwright home, the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real. And if they weren't real, they should have been. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

Answer the following question: \\"Pallaseidae\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? Answer:","output":"The term \\"Pallaseidae\\" belongs to the category of animal. Pallaseidae is a family of bristle worms under the class Polychaeta. These marine worms are also referred to as scale worms due to their characteristic elytra or scales covering their dorsal surfaces which act as protection and aid in camouflage. They can be found in various aquatic environments, from tidal zones to deep-sea regions, and play essential roles in marine ecosystems. Polychaetes, in general, are a diverse and abundant group of segmented worms, with over 10,000 species identified to date. Among these, the family Pallaseidae is relatively less-studied, but recent taxonomic and molecular analyses have enhanced the understanding of their phylogeny and diversity. Members of the Pallaseidae family are typically small-sized and are known to inhabit coarse sediments like sand and gravel in their respective ecosystems. Their body plan consists of a number of segments, each with a pair of fleshy appendages known as parapodia, which assist in locomotion and respiration. These worms are often seen burrowing in the sediment or crawling across the surface as part of their feeding habits, which include scavenging, predation, and deposit feeding (consuming organic materials found on or within the sediment). Some species exhibit unique reproductive strategies, where individuals can regenerate lost body parts or reproduce asexually through fragmentation and subsequent regeneration. Thus, Pallaseidae is a family of bristle worms within the class Polychaeta, which are categorized under the broader group of animals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The announcement was completely unexpected and confusing. It brought the nation to a what? - shock - standstill - pain - scandal - controversy  The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer is \\"standstill.\\" When a nation hears an unexpected and confusing announcement, it can cause people to pause and try to understand the implications of this information. In some cases, the impact of a significant announcement might be so profound that it brings a nation to a standstill. This means that the normal course of life, business, and communication can slow down or stop temporarily as people process the event. A \\"shock\\" refers to a sudden, surprising event that may leave people feeling surprised or stunned. Although unexpected announcements can indeed shock individuals, the term \\"standstill\\" more accurately captures the idea of slowing or stopping the normal flow of activity in a nation. \\"Pain\\" is a feeling of discomfort or distress, and it usually refers to physical or emotional suffering. While a surprising announcement can cause emotional pain for some people, it is not the overall impact on a nation.  A \\"scandal\\" implies something is morally or legally wrong, and it usually involves a high-profile individual or organization. While it is possible that the surprising announcement could lead to a scandal, this term does not effectively convey the idea of a nation slowing down or stopping activity to process the information. \\"Controversy\\" typically refers to a public debate or disagreement over an issue. While a surprising announcement can undoubtedly lead to controversy, this term does not fully describe the initial reaction that brings the nation to a standstill as people process the news.

Both sentences highlight the commanders and supporters of the opposing fleets during a historical conflict. Here is a detailed comparison of the sentences with an explanation of why they mean the same thing: 1. The key component in both sentences is the mention of the Octavian fleet's commander, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, and the supporter of Antony's fleet, Queen Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt. This information is consistent in both sentences, ensuring that the core meaning remains the same. 2. Sentence (1) uses the terms \\"Antonius\\" and \\"Antony\\" for the same person- Mark Antony, who was a Roman military leader and part of the Second Triumvirate. Sentence (2) uses an abbreviated form of \\"Antonius,\\" which is \\"Antony.\\" The different word choice does not affect the overall meaning as they both refer to the same person. 3. In both sentences, it is evident that the fleets of Octavian and Antony are at odds with each other. The mention of the two commanders, as well as their respective supporters, implies that they are on opposing sides. 4. Although sentence (1) states that Antony's fleet is \\"supported\\" by Queen Cleopatra's power, while sentence (2) states that his fleet is supported by \\"the power of Queen Cleopatra,\\" the meaning doesn't change. In both cases, it is clear that Cleopatra's influence and resources are backing Antony's fleet. Based on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that both sentences convey the same meaning by highlighting the commanders and supporters of the two opposing fleets, despite having slight differences in their structure and word choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Notice that in Finnish, the passive voice is used instead of the first person. 3. \\"on the Commission's part\\" - This expression specifies that the tendency is related to the Commission. It can be translated as \\"komission osalta\\" in Finnish, meaning \\"regarding the Commission\\". 4. \\"to pay less attention\\" - This expression can be directly translated to \\"kiinnittää vähemmän huomiota\\", which means \\"to pay less attention\\". 5. \\"to what Parliament does and asks\\" - This expression involves two actions by the Parliament: \\"does\\" and \\"asks\\".

Pick from:  --No  --Yes Answer:","output":"Yes, you should validate the answer, as it is correct in stating that Ancient Greeks and Romans indeed distinguished between natural and artificial memory. However, the provided answer should be elaborated to include more information on mnemonic devices specifically. Mnemonic devices are learning techniques or memory aids that help individuals remember and recall information more efficiently. While the Ancient Greeks and Romans did distinguish between natural memory (unassisted memory) and artificial memory (memory aids or techniques), the term 'mnemonic devices' specifically refers to the methods that enhance artificial memory. Some commonly suggested mnemonic devices include: 1. Acronyms: Creating words from the first letters of a series of words to be remembered (e.g., 'USA' for 'United States of America') 2. Acrostics: Forming a sentence where the first letter of each word stands for another word in the sequence to remember (e.g., the sentence \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge\\" to recall the musical notes EGBDF on the lines of the treble clef) 3. Chunking: Breaking information into smaller, more manageable chunks (for example, remembering a phone number as 3 or 4 smaller groups rather than one long string of digits) 4. Visual Imagery: Associating certain information with vivid, mental images can make it easier to recall later 5. Rhymes: Creating memorable rhymes to assist in recalling information (e.g., \\"In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue\\") 6. The Method of Loci: Also known as the Memory Palace, where information is associated with a familiar location to aid in recall 7. Peg-Word Associations: Linking new information to known, easy-to-recall keywords or 'pegs' It is essential to provide more context about mnemonic devices rather than solely discussing the distinction between natural and artificial memory made by the Ancient Greeks and Romans.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.

In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management.

Brad studied ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago. His colleague Phil studied human settlement from 8-10,000 years ago. They were both fascinated by their findings.  Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.

The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics.  - Aleppo (/ ALA-LC: \\"\\") is a city in Syria, serving as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous Syrian governorate. With an official population of 2,132,100 (2004 census), Aleppo was the largest Syrian city before the Syrian Civil War; however, now Aleppo is likely the second-largest city in Syria after the capital Damascus.  - Damascus (' ) is the capital and likely the largest city of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the ongoing battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as \\"ash-Sham\\" (') and nicknamed as the \\"City of Jasmine\\" (\\"\\").

The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 .  - Jordan ('), officially The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ('), is an Arab kingdom in Western Asia, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the east and south, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, Israel, Palestine and the Dead Sea to the west and the Red Sea in its extreme south-west. Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most populous city as well as the country's economic, political and cultural centre.  - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.  - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant.

I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband. I honestly think if it had been one of my children doing the abusing, I would have found a way to put my child into long-term rehab. I would not have pretended it wasn’t happening, or “not that bad” or other form of denial. As is, I lived through this hell for two years, and a part of me will never forgive for how it all came about. Probably TMI, sorry.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. German politics is suddenly looking a lot less predictable and potentially less stable. It's all because of the astonishing success of the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD). Many German voters appear rattled by the large numbers of refugees and migrants arriving in Germany - 1.1 million in 2015 alone. Politicians are now getting down to the nitty-gritty of coalition-building. But all the cards have been thrown up in the air so it's a question of seeing where they will settle. And it's going to get messy. Papers say Merkel 'paying price' Profile: Angela Merkel AfD leader Frauke Petry Each of the three regional premiers should be able to hang on to power. Popular Green party Premier Winfried Kretschmann, of the south-western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has shown that the Greens' success in what used to be a conservative heartland is not just a blip from a 2011 election held in the aftermath of Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster. Centre-left SPD Premier Malu Dreyer, of Rhineland-Palatinate, confidently saw off the CDU's promising rising star Julia Kloeckner by rather bizarrely doing a better job at imitating Mrs Merkel's centrist stance on refugees than the chancellor's own candidate. CDU Premier Reiner Haseloff also held on in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, where AfD polled almost a quarter of the vote. But this is far from a continuation of the status quo. They will have to govern with new, and in some cases untested, coalition partners. Gone are the days of two major parties, one on the right, one on the left. German politics has become splintered. Smaller, more radical parties are gaining influence. And adventurous coalition combinations are now possible, including in Saxony-Anhalt, where a distinctly uncomfortable menage-a-trois between centre-right CDU, centre-left SPD and the left-wing Greens looks like the only feasible option. The right-wing AfD's tough populist talk has attracted voters angered by the influx of migrants, chipping away at the traditional support base on both the left and the right - conservative voters who are disenchanted with Angela Merkel's pro-refugee approach as well as blue-collar left-wingers who feel nervous that state spending on migrants will undermine their own position in society. The big question is what this means for Angela Merkel's stance on refugees. Closed borders along the Balkan route have effectively already slammed shut her open door invitation to Syrian refugees. But Mrs Merkel's pro-refugee rhetoric has barely changed. She still believes Germany, and indeed the rest of Europe, has a responsibility to shelter people fleeing war. She refuses to contemplate a cap on numbers coming to Germany. \\"We need a European solution and this solution needs time,\\" she told journalists in Berlin on Monday afternoon. So have these elections undermined Chancellor Merkel's leadership? Yes and no. The gains of the AfD will certainly embolden conservative critics within her own ranks, who accuse her of betraying right-wing values, by dragging her party to the centre-ground. Awkwardly, many of Mrs Merkel's supporters on the refugee issue are in opposing left-wing parties. Not a great help when it comes to managing her own political bloc. But Angela Merkel still has no credible rivals within her government and no other party or politician has yet come up with a popular viable solution for the migrant crisis either. Despite the success of the AfD, this election campaign has shown that her approach still enjoys the support of mainstream society. It was the candidates, whether on the left or the right, who backed her approach who won out. In Rhineland-Palatinate for example, voters were treated to the astonishing sight of a TV duel in which the centre-left Malu Dreyer argued with CDU Julia Kloeckner over who was most loyal to Mrs Merkel's position on refugees. It is not so much Angela Merkel who has been punished by these elections, as her increasingly divided government.","output":"The success of the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in recent elections may lead to less predictable and stable German politics, as smaller, more radical parties gain influence and force new and untested coalition partnerships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two rivers, The Minninnippi and The Cedar, flow into the same ocean. The Minninnippi is surrounded almost entirely by farm lands due its location in a flat area of the country that sees regular rainfall. The majority of these farms will have runoff from their crop soil flow into the river. The Cedar is located mostly inside an unpopulated forest. Currently, not much industrialization or settling by humans has happened near The Cedar.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will the ocean water near The Minninnippi or The Cedar have less oxygen?  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Answer:","output":"The ocean water near The Minninnippi will likely have less oxygen as compared to the water near The Cedar. This conclusion is based on the factors affecting each river's surrounding environment and their impacts on oxygen levels in the ocean.  The Minninnippi River is bordered by extensive farmlands, which makes it susceptible to runoff from the agricultural activities taking place on those lands. Agriculture is one of the primary sources of marine pollution due to the heavy usage of fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals. When these substances are washed into the river by rain or irrigation, they enter the body of water and ultimately flow into the ocean.  As the hint states, an excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals contributes to hypoxia, a condition where oxygen levels become very low, and the creation of dead zones in the water. Dead zones are areas where the oxygen concentration is so low that it cannot support most marine life, leading to mass die-offs of fish and other aquatic organisms. Additionally, runoff from livestock and human waste in the farmlands alongside The Minninnippi River can introduce organic matter and nutrients into the water, further depleting oxygen levels when bacteria decompose this material and consume oxygen in the process. On the other hand, The Cedar River flows mainly through an unpopulated forest, indicating that it has minimal exposure to human interference, industrialization, or large-scale agricultural activities. Consequently, the river is likely to have much lower levels of pollutants and oxygen-depleting substances entering the water system, which means that ocean water near The Cedar is likely to have comparatively higher levels of dissolved oxygen. In conclusion, the ocean water near The Minninnippi is expected to have less oxygen than the ocean water near The Cedar, mainly due to the heightened presence of agricultural runoff and other pollutants associated with farming activities. Conversely, the unpopulated nature of The Cedar's environment suggests that it is better preserved and less impacted by human activities, resulting in higher levels of dissolved oxygen in the ocean nearby."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The anticipation of discomfort or pain often associated with dentist visits could interpret this tweet as carrying a slightly negative sentiment.  On the other hand, if a tweeter has a particularly positive philosophy towards healthcare or personal hygiene, this could possibly carry a positive sentiment, showing responsible behavior regarding dental health. However, this interpretation would be less common as it demands more context or personal information about the tweeter.  Overall, without further context or clues like emojis, accompanying text, punctuation style or previous tweets that could provide broader context about the user's feelings towards dental visits, one should assume a neutral sentiment for this tweet, as it only provides factual information without an explicit expression of sentiment."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Instead of steaks, she got sweet potatoes to eat because the","output":"price difference was significant and she needed to save money. As a smart and resourceful individual, Jill had learned that sweet potatoes were not only a healthier option, providing more fiber and essential nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, and manganese, but they were also incredibly versatile, allowing her to create various delicious dishes that would satisfy her cravings and still remain within her financial limits. Despite being initially dismayed about not having her favorite meal of steak, she embraced the challenge of working with sweet potatoes, knowing that it would not only help her save money, but also encourage her to adopt a healthier eating habit that might lead to positive long-term benefits. To ensure she wouldn't get bored of her newfound staple, Jill decided to explore different cooking methods such as boiling, roasting, or baking, as well as experimenting with various recipes that incorporated diverse flavors and textures, inspired by numerous cuisines from around the world. Her culinary journey began with some simple yet satisfying dishes, like sweet potato fries seasoned with garlic and paprika, roasted sweet potato wedges accompanied by a tangy yogurt dip, or a comforting bowl of creamy sweet potato soup garnished with crunchy croutons and fresh cilantro. As she gained more confidence in her cooking skills, Jill started to venture into more complex recipes, such as spicy sweet potato and black bean enchiladas, Thai-inspired sweet potato curry, or a light and refreshing sweet potato noodle salad tossed in a zesty lime dressing. Throughout this process, she discovered that sweet potatoes could easily serve as a hearty base for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, making it a perfect option whenever she wanted to reduce her meat consumption or simply enjoy a meat-free meal. In fact, on some occasions, she would even manage to treat herself to a small portion of her beloved steak while still using the affordable and nutrient-dense sweet potatoes as a side dish, enabling her to indulge in her favorite meal without jeopardizing her budget. Jill also enjoyed sharing her newfound love for sweet potatoes with her friends and family, who were equally impressed by the diverse range of flavors and textures she could achieve with this humble yet versatile vegetable. They would often gather around the dining table, excitedly sampling her latest creations, laughing, and exchanging cooking tips and stories, making it evident that budget-friendly sweet potatoes had brought more than just financial savings into her life – they had nurtured new memories, connections, and unforgettable experiences, all underpinned by the simple yet profound act of cooking and sharing a meal. Ultimately, Jill's decision to embrace sweet potatoes as an alternative to steaks proved to be more than just a financially motivated choice. What began as a budget-inspired compromise quickly evolved into a rewarding journey of culinary exploration, healthier eating habits, strengthened relationships, and personal growth, demonstrating that sometimes, life's unexpected challenges can pave the way for the most gratifying and transformative experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Toby Harnden. PUBLISHED:. 18:09 EST, 12 July 2012. |. UPDATED:. 18:09 EST, 12 July 2012. The Romney campaign has accused Barack Obama of being a serial liar and the President’s aides hit back by suggesting the Republican candidate might have committed a felony as the 2012 election reached new heights of rancour. After weeks of Republicans urging Mr Romney to hit back hard at attacks on his record at Bain Capital, his campaign released a new television ad entitled ‘No Evidence’ accusing Mr Obama of deceit in claiming that the former Massachusetts governor shipped jobs overseas while heading the venture capital firm. The ad, which will run in several battleground states, asks voters: ‘When a president doesn't tell the truth, how can we trust him to lead?’ The press release which accompanied the ad in an email to journalists also referred to Mr Obama's ‘lies and exaggerations’. Under fire: Mitt Romney has been accused by the Obama campaign of committing a felony by lying in regulatory documents about his employment at Bain Capital. But Mr Romney found himself on the defensive over a Boston Globe article citing federal documents filed by Bain Capital that conflicted with the presumptive Republican nominee’s statements about when he left Bain Capital. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2001, Bain Capital listed Mr Romney as the company's ‘sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president’. It said Mr Romney's ‘principal occupation’ was as Bain's managing director. Mr Romney's campaign, backed up by a number of independent fact checkers, has repeatedly said Mr Romney had almost nothing to do with the company's operations after February 1999, when he began work on the imperilled 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Andrea Saul, Mr Romney’s spokeswoman, said that her boss ‘left Bain Capital in February of 1999 to run the Olympics, and had no input on investments or management of companies after that point’. Accusation: The Romney campaign has suggested that President Obama is lying about Bain in campaign ads. The significance of the period from 1999 to 2001 is that it covers the time when Bain oversaw investments that either sent jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy. It's also when Mr Romney stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in Bain Capital. For example, in late 1999, Bain-controlled Steam International set up overseas call centres, and a subsidiary moved jobs from California to Mexico. The following year, the Ampad company declared bankruptcy. In 2001, the steel maker GS Industries also fell to bankruptcy as Bain made 58.4million from its investment. Republicans fear that the relentless attacks on Mr Romney, who is worth more than 250million, over his time at Bain Capital, his failure to release tax returns, his investments in Swiss bank accounts, Bermuda and the Caymans are defining him as an out-of-touch plutocrat. The two presidential campaigns dispute how many American jobs were affected but the Romney campaign's line all along has been that it is irrelevant because Mr Romney wasn't involved in the company’s decisions for that period. Stephanie Cutter, Mr Obama's deputy campaign manager, said that Mr Romney may have committed a felony if he misrepresented his role at Bain on the SEC documents. And if he was running Bain after 1999, Ms Cutter said, Mr Romney hasn't been truthful with the public. ‘If that's the case, if he was lying to the American people, then that's a real character and trust issue,’ she said. Matt Rhoades, Mr Romney’s campaign manager, issued a blistering statement in response. ‘President Obama's campaign hit a new low today when one of its senior advisers made a reckless and unsubstantiated charge to reporters about Mitt Romney that was so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign,’ he said. ‘President Obama ought to apologize for the out-of-control behaviour of his staff, which demeans the office he holds. Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought, but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article is about an argument between the campaigns of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. Obama's campaign accuses Mitt Romney of not being honest about his time at Bain Capital and maybe even committing a legal mistake. Mitt Romney's campaign says that Barack Obama is not telling the truth and asks how people can trust him to lead the country. Both campaigns are arguing about when Romney left Bain Capital and if he was responsible for decisions made during that time. They are also fighting about the importance of this information for people who are voting in the election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Corn on the cob was her favorite. She bought some from the store. She boiled it and put salt and butter all over it. Corn is actually a fruit.","output":"Based on the given paragraph, we cannot draw a conclusion that the sentence, \\"Corn is actually a fruit,\\" is true. The paragraph focuses on Abby's love for eating vegetables, her preference for corn on the cob, and how she prepared and enjoyed it. It does not provide any information or fact about the classification of corn as a fruit. To determine whether corn is a fruit or not, we need to examine its botanical definition and characteristics. In botanical terms, a fruit is defined as the mature ovary of a flowering plant, usually containing seeds. Corn belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is considered a grain or a cereal crop. The part of corn we eat, the kernels, are the seeds of the plant. Technically, since corn kernels are seeds, corn could be considered a type of dry fruit called a caryopsis. However, this classification is unlikely to be widely known, and corn is commonly regarded as a grain or a vegetable in everyday contexts. While the given paragraph and sentence are related to the topic of corn, the sentence's statement about corn being a fruit is not supported or mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the sentence is true based only on the information provided in the paragraph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer: If \\"Two girls are performing tricks on a trampoline.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The girls are jumping on the trampoline\\"?  [a]. yes [b]. it is not possible to tell [c]. no","output":"[a]. Yes It logically follows that \\"The girls are jumping on the trampoline\\" when given the information that \\"Two girls are performing tricks on a trampoline.\\" To understand the reasoning behind this answer, let's first break down the given statement and analyze the components. The statement, \\"Two girls are performing tricks on a trampoline,\\" tells us three things: 1. There are two girls involved. 2. These girls are performing tricks. 3. These tricks are being performed on a trampoline. Now, let's focus on the second part of the statement: the girls are performing tricks. When we think about trampolines, the most common way to perform tricks or maneuvers is through jumping. Trampolines provide the bounce and airtime necessary to execute various forms of flips, twists, and other aerial moves. Jumping is the essential action on a trampoline that makes it possible to perform any tricks. While there could be other ways to incorporate the trampoline into a trick or performance without specifically jumping, these alternative tricks are a rare exception and not the norm. For example, one could sit down on the trampoline and perform a somersault without their feet leaving the trampoline, but this is not the typical image that comes to mind when we think of \\"performing tricks on a trampoline.\\" Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that jumping is involved in the girls' tricks based on the given statement. It is logical to assume that the girls are jumping on the trampoline in order to execute these maneuvers and perform the tricks they are participating in. In conclusion, given the context and information provided in the statement, it logically follows that \\"the girls are jumping on the trampoline.\\" The action of jumping is a necessary component of most trampoline tricks and the primary quality associated with trampoline use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Math Problem Solve 97*r - 167*r - 785 = -155 for r.","output":"To solve the equation 97*r - 167*r - 785 = -155 for r, we start by simplifying the terms containing the variable r: 97*r - 167*r = (97 - 167)*r = -70*r Now, the equation can be written as: -70*r - 785 = -155 Next step is to isolate the term with the variable r, so we'll add 785 to both sides of the equation: -70*r - 785 + 785 = -155 + 785 -70*r = 630 Now, to solve for r, we will divide both sides of the equation by -70: (-70*r) / -70 = 630 / -70 r = -9 Therefore, the solution for the given equation is r = -9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Hound of the Baskervilles is a 1978 British comedy film spoofing \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It starred Peter Cook as Sherlock Holmes and Dudley Moore as Dr. Watson. A number of other well-known British comedy actors appeared in the film including Terry-Thomas (in his final screen appearance), Kenneth Williams and Denholm Elliott. Can we infer the following? The Hound of the Baskervilles is an action thriller.","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" (1978) is an action thriller. While the original novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, upon which the film is based, is a mystery and suspense novel, the 1978 film adaptation is described as a British comedy film spoofing the original story. The presence of well-known British comedy actors like Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Terry-Thomas, Kenneth Williams, and Denholm Elliott in the film further supports the comedic nature of this adaptation. The original story of \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" does contain elements of action and thriller, as it follows Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigating a mysterious and potentially supernatural hound that is believed to be responsible for the death of a wealthy landowner. This investigation leads them into a complex web of secrets and lies, putting them in dangerous situations, which could classify the story as an action thriller. However, the 1978 film version takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to the material, opting for a satirical and humorous portrayal rather than maintaining the suspenseful and thrilling atmosphere of the original novel. Since the film is a comedy spoof, it can be assumed that it relies heavily on humor, slapstick, and parody to engage the audience, rather than the action-packed, thrilling moments that are associated with the action thriller genre. In conclusion, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the 1978 film \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is an action thriller. Instead, we can accurately describe it as a British comedy film spoofing the original story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, with a focus on humor, satire, and parody."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

Choices:  - budding  - glycolysis  - pollination  - photosynthesis  A: The answer is:","output":"The answer is: Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy in the form of glucose (food) and oxygen. This process primarily occurs in the leaves of plants, where chlorophyll (a green pigment) and other accessory pigments are present. During photosynthesis, plants capture sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and water (H2O) from the soil. These elements are then converted into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) through a series of complex reactions. Glucose provides the plants with energy for growth and maintenance, while oxygen is released as a byproduct, serving as a critical source of oxygen for other living organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: A:","output":"The tone of this product review can be described as mostly positive with a hint of defensive. The author begins the review by addressing the video quality concerns they have seen in other reviews and decides to check out the video for themselves. They quickly remind readers that these videos were made in the 80's when DVDs, HD, and 1080p did not exist, which sets the stage for their defense of the video quality. The author goes on to state that the video quality is good and that there is a noticeable difference when compared to newer videos, but they claim that other viewers' expectations were overdrawn. This implies that the author believes the video quality of this product is satisfactory, but other people may be overly critical due to modern expectations. The mention of \\"Madonna lovers\\" may also indicate that this product review is geared towards a particular audience – those who are fans of Madonna. The review further praises the product, emphasizing that it is a collection worth having and noting their own longtime appreciation for the Queen of Pop. The author is particularly interested in watching the transformation unfold from the beginning to the end of the videos. Overall, while the review does bring up concerns about video quality, it primarily focuses on praising the content and defending the product against what the author perceives as unfair criticism. The tone, therefore, leans more towards positive, with an edge of defensiveness against detractors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After the Congress of Vienna, Austria and Prussia emerged as two competitors. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting. These terms came to a sudden halt following the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1856, paving the way for German unification in the 1860s. By the 1820s, large numbers of Jewish German women had intermarried with Christian German men and had converted to Christianity.

Article: Rivers are one of our most important natural resources . Many of the world's great cities are located on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important part in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of history, people have used rivers for transportation. The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeastern Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil . It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles up it. Besides transportation, rivers give food to eat, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun. In order to increase the supply  of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam  across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate  their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located on rivers often cause problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of these natural resources.

Passage:After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the rivalry between Iran and Pakistan intensified. After 1989, both state's policies in Afghanistan became even more divergent as Pakistan, under Benazir Bhutto, explicitly supported Taliban forces in Afghanistan. This resulted in a major breach, with Iran becoming closer to India. Pakistan's support for the Sunni Taliban organisation in Afghanistan became a problem for Shia Iran which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The Pakistani backed Taliban fought the Iranian backed Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and gained control of 90 percent of that country. As noted by a Pakistani foreign service officer, it was difficult to maintain good relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Iran at the same time, given Iran's long history of rivalry with these states. In 1995 Bhutto paid a lengthy state visit to Iran, which greatly relaxed relations. At a public meeting she spoke highly of Iran and Iranian society. However, increasing activity by Shia militants in Pakistan strained relations further. This was followed by the Taliban's capture of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, in which thousands of Shias were massacred, according to Amnesty International. The most serious breach in relations came in 1998, after Iran accused Taliban Afghanistan of taking 11 Iranian diplomats, 35 Iranian truck drivers and an Iranian journalist hostage, and later killing them all. Iran massed over 300,000 troops on the Afghan border and threatened to attack the Taliban government, which it had never recognized. This strained relations with Pakistan, as the Taliban were seen as Pakistan's key allies. In May 1998, Iran criticised Pakistan for its nuclear testing in the Chagai region, and held Pakistan accountable for global \\"atomic proliferation\\". New Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif acknowledged his country's nuclear capability on 7 September 1997.

Question: suppose you exercise often happens, how will it affect bad waste is not removed.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: less Here's the step-by-step thought process and justification: 1. When you exercise, your body's metabolism increases, which means that more waste products are generated. 2. Exercise increases blood flow, which helps flush out waste products more efficiently. 3. As blood flow increases, it also helps deliver more nutrients and oxygen to tissues, promoting overall health and well-being. 4. Regular exercise can strengthen the kidneys, helping them work more effectively at filtering out waste products. 5. Since the kidneys play a major role in removing bad waste from the body, their improved efficiency due to exercise would mean that less bad waste would accumulate in the body. 6.

Article: Drinking water is good for your health. There are some scientific ways of drinking water. 1. It is the best medicine to drink two glasses of water in the morning. 2. Drink clean water. 3. Drink the water that has not been boiled. Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night. So you should drink some water to keep your health after getting up in the morning. That can prevent high blood pressure, cerebral hemorrhages and so on. 2) Drinking water at about 10 am helps your body keep enough water. 3) Drinking water at about 3 pm can clean out the wastes in your body. 4) About eight o'clock in the evening is the best time to drink water. Your blood gets thicker when you sleep. Water will make your blood less thick. Besides, we should drink 2L of water every day. Water is so important for our life. We should drink water often.

The painting known as Queen Elizabeth going in procession to Blackfriars in 1601, or simply The Procession Picture  (see illustration), is now often accepted as the work of Peake. The attribution was made by Roy Strong, who called it \\"one of the great visual mysteries of the Elizabethan age\\". It is an example of the convention, prevalent in the later part of her reign, of painting Elizabeth as an icon, portraying her as much younger and more triumphant than she was. As Strong puts it, \\"[t]his is Gloriana in her sunset glory, the mistress of the set piece, of the calculated spectacular presentation of herself to her adoring subjects\\". George Vertue, the eighteenth-century antiquarian, called the painting \\"not well nor ill done\\".Strong reveals that the procession was connected to the marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen's six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen's Horse in 1601.Peake clearly did not paint the queen, or indeed the courtiers, from life but from the \\"types\\" or standard portraits used by the workshops of the day. Portraits of the queen were subject to restrictions, and from about 1594 there seems to have been an official policy that she always be depicted as youthful. In 1594, the Privy council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen be found and destroyed, since they caused Elizabeth \\"great offence\\".

Summarize: Winger Anthony Knockaert fired the Seagulls ahead early on, with a low 20-yard effort into the corner. Sam Baldock slotted the ball in to double the lead just before the break. Matej Vydra headed against the outside of the post for Derby, before Glenn Murray bundled in his 18th goal of the campaign from Knockaert's cross to seal Brighton's 14th home win of the season. The Seagulls remain second in the table with an inferior goal difference to Newcastle, but now have a nine-point buffer to Huddersfield in third - albeit the Terriers have two games in hand. Of their nine matches left, eight are against sides in the bottom half of the table as they look to return to the top flight for the first time since 1982-83. Following a trip to play-off chasing Leeds next Saturday, April's fixture list is kind to Chris Hughton's men with home games against Blackburn, Birmingham, Wigan and Bristol City. Their outstanding frontline of Murray, Baldock and Knockaert have now scored 42 Championship goals between them this campaign, and gave Derby's defenders a torrid time with their pace, movement and clinical finishing. Former Leicester forward Knockaert was instrumental in most of Brighton's attacking play, bending home a superb effort to open the scoring and seeing Scott Carson tip over his fierce second-half strike. The Rams started with former England pair Darren Bent and David Nugent up front, but Brighton's defence were rarely troubled in keeping their 19th clean sheet of the season. Derby, who are 10th and 10 points behind sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday, have now only picked up six points from their past nine matches and their play-off hopes appear to be over for another season. Brighton manager Chris Hughton: \\"We now have 77 points and there is no points target from our last nine games. \\"We've got some tough games coming up and everybody is fighting. But we're on the back of a really good performance against a really good side tonight. We were very good from start to finish. \\"The timing of the first goal was pivotal, the second just before half-time lifted us and we were able to take that on in the second half.\\" Derby County boss Steve McClaren:  \\"It was a lesson for my team and this showed how far Brighton have come. They are going up for certain. Murray was a great signing and Brighton are a team that are going up. The gap showed. \\"It was a reality check for us. We have played three games in a week and we couldn't deal with the physicality of that. \\"That is the benchmark of where we need to go. In the 16 months I was away teams have really kicked on in terms of physicality. The league has kicked on. We need to learn the lessons and kick on ourselves.\\" McClaren on his future at Derby: \\"I am confident I can take it on, absolutely. We need to take the club on to the next level and from one day we knew that. \\"The chairman wants Derby in the Premier League. We have all the resources and don't need to panic.

With the NES, Nintendo also changed the relationship of console manufacturers and third-party software developers by restricting developers from publishing and distributing software without licensed approval.

A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub.

However, The Associated Press and the Washington Post reported Thursday that contrary to what the State Department and Levinson's family have said for years, Levinson actually was working for the CIA in Iran. And a source involved in the matter told CNN there's proof that Levinson worked for the CIA undercover, and under contract, while also working as a private investigator. White House: Levinson not a government employee when he made Iran trip. That allegation doesn't sit well with Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who is on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. \\"What disturbs me is apparently they did not tell the truth to the Congress.

During a September interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was asked what he could tell Levinson's family. \\"We don't know where he is, who he is,\\" Rouhani said. \\"He is an American who has disappeared. We have no news of him.\\" McCain: CIA did not tell Congress the truth about Levinson. Kerry said the United States is still looking for proof that Levinson is alive. A \\"number of different channels\\" are \\"being worked aggressively,\\" he said. Iran's previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said he was willing to help find Levinson, and the family received what then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described in 2010 as \\"proof of life.\\" In 2011, the State Department said new evidence suggested that Levinson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, was alive and being held somewhere in southwest Asia. This year, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, \\"We have every reason to believe that he's alive and that the Iranians control his fate.\\" Asked whether he believes the Iranian government is responsible for Levinson's disappearance, Kerry said he thinks the government \\"has the ability to help us here, and we hope they will.\\" McCain said he was \\"confident we are doing everything that we can\\" to get Levinson released from Iran,. He added that any negotiations in Levinson's case should also include attempts to free other Americans who are believed to be in Iranian custody.

Contrary to previous claims by the State Department and Levinson's family, reports have emerged that Levinson was actually working for the CIA in Iran. Senator John McCain has expressed concern over the CIA's involvement in Levinson's case, and the transparency of information provided to Congress. Iran's government has consistently denied holding Levinson or having knowledge of his whereabouts. The U.S. is still looking for proof that Levinson is alive, with Kerry stating that he believes the Iranian government has the ability to help in this matter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Esquisses of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, Les cloches (The Bells), to the strident tone clusters of no. 45, Les diablotins (The Imps), and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, Laus Deo (Praise God). They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled Sonatine, Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of \\"ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.\\"Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces. Alkan's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his Benedictus, Op. 54 (1859).

Alkan also issued a book of 12 studies for the pedalboard alone (no opus number, 1866) and the Bombardo-carillon for pedalboard duet (four feet) of 1872.Alkan's return to the concert platform at his Petits Concerts, however, marked the end of his publications; his final work to be issued was the Toccatina, Op. 75, in 1872.","output":"The name of the person who believes that the set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes, published in 1859, reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty\\" is Smith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - DVD (an abbreviation of \\"digital versatile disc\\" or \\"digital video disc\\") is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995. The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions.  - Monty Python (sometimes known as The Pythons) were a British surreal comedy group who created their sketch comedy show \\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\\", which first aired on the BBC in 1969. Forty-five episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact, including touring stage shows, films, numerous albums, several books, and a stage musical. The Pythons' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. The \\"Orlando Sentinel\\" referred to their sketch show as \\"not only one of the more enduring icons of 1970s British popular culture, but also an important moment in the evolution of television comedy.\\"  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - Fingerprince is an album by The Residents . The album was recorded between 1974 -- 76 and released in 1977 . It was intended to be a three - sided record named Tourniquet Of Roses . Due to expense , the project was abandoned and cut down to a regular two - sided album . The third side was originally released separately in 1979 as Babyfingers . For the CD release of Fingerprince , all of the songs from Babyfingers which were originally supposed to be part of the album were included in their original running order . The 1995 Euro Ralph CD reissue of Fingerprince kept the original track order from the vinyl , but included the complete Babyfingers as a bonus 3 \`\` CD with the album .  - Ralph Records was the Residents' original record label, the name coming from the slang phrase for vomiting, \\"calling Ralph on the porcelain telephone\\".  - Babyfingers was a release by the avant garde/experimental rock band The Residents, containing music written for their 1977 album, \\"Fingerprince\\". As \\"Fingerprince\\" was originally meant to be a three-sided album (a concept abandoned due to expense and Monty Python's \\"Matching Tie and Handkerchief\\" beating them to the punch), much of the material was abandoned and the third side remained unfinished until November 1977 although most tracks from the EP was shown at the Residents Radio Special in September 1977. Thus, the group reduced the third side to an extended play record entitled '\\"Babyfingers'\\", and released it in 1979 to people who had been waiting for their copy of \\"The Third Reich and Roll\\" box sets. A second printing was made for members of the W.E.I.R.D. fan club in 1981, and a last pressing, on pink vinyl, in 1985. For the most part, it has been incorporated into most CD versions of \\"Fingerprince\\", beginning in 1988.  - The Residents are an American art collective best known for avant-garde music and multimedia works. Since their first official release, \\"Meet the Residents\\" (1974), the group has released over sixty albums, numerous music videos and short films, three CD-ROM projects, and ten DVDs. They have undertaken seven major world tours and scored multiple films. Pioneers in exploring the potential of CD-ROM and similar technologies, the Residents have won several awards for their multimedia projects.

During the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600 short tons (540 metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US 550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.

Product review: I was disappointed with this book, as it seemed to start to lead somewhere, and then wander off. I first thought the abrupt change in the daughter's behaviour, that leads to her being mentally ill was just not quite right in the description. She was perfect one moment, the child from hell the next. She returns from camp with a navel piercing: no professional would do that for a 14 year old and it is practically impossible to do yourself. Then there was the accident, it seemed almost as if Kate was going to admit she was on drugs or drinking when it happened,but she never did. It seemed a little too trite considering the heavy tone of the writing in the aftermath. However, the description of the borderline personality mother was perfection in itself: how they ruin the lives of others. That alone was worth the read. Rest of it was just below average. Also, as it was called Family History, it never linked the mental illness to the family, in my estimation.

The answer to this question is:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's go step-by-step through the process and see whether less moisture evaporation has a direct or indirect effect on body cooling: 1. Body temperature rises: This is the initial trigger for the process, and it is not affected by the perturbation hypothesis. 2. The brain tells blood vessels to dilate: This step occurs as a direct response to the rising body temperature and is also not affected by the hypothesis. 3. The sweat glands become active: This step occurs due to the signals from the brain, and it is not affected by the perturbation hypothesis. 4. Moisture is released from the pores: This step occurs as the sweat glands become active, and it is also not affected by the hypothesis. 5. The moisture evaporates: This is the step in which the perturbation hypothesis comes into play. Suppose less moisture evaporates, it means less heat will be removed from the body during the evaporation process. 6. The evaporation causes cooling: If less moisture evaporates, it would result in a reduced cooling effect. Consequently, this will have a direct effect on body cooling.

Social Networking Trends from Coast to Coast Residents of Massachusetts and California led the nation in googling the term “social networking” during the last 12 months according to Google Insights for Search, a new search analysis tool. Launched on August 6, Google Insights for Search is a free service that allows users to track the popularity of phrases and words that have been typed into Google’s search engine from 2004 until the present day. The resource enables users to sort data by country, sub-region, time and industry. The application also includes heat maps that display the geographic location of where terms are most popular, the top searches related to a term or phrase, and the fastest rising searches. As of August 8, Massachusetts and California each had a search volume index or SVI of 100 for regional interest in social networking, tops in the nation for the past 12 months. The term “search volume index” or SVI is a measurement that reflects how many searches have been done for a particular term, relative to the total number of searches done on Google over time. Rounding out the top ten were New York (SVI=96), the District of Columbia (96), Washington (88), Maryland (86), Illinois (84), Georgia (80), New Jersey (80) and Utah (80). Nationwide, the top three related searches to social networking were “social networking sites,” “social networking site,” and “social network.” The fastest rising searches were “social networking trends,” “social networking tools,” and “social networking scripts.” By city, Google searches for the term “social networking” was highest in Pleasanton (SVI=100), a suburb of San Francisco. Close behind were New York (92), San Francisco (91), Austin (76), Washington (76), Los Angeles (73), Boston (71), Reston (69), Chicago (66) and Atlanta (63). Also of interest: How search volumes for the term “social networking” have changed over time. After periods of relatively minimal interest for the term in 2004 and 2005, search volumes took off in first quarter 2006 and peaked in November, 2007. After a sharp dip in December, 2007, search volumes have shown steady upward growth throughout the first half of 2008. Google cautions that the results show the likelihood of users in a particular area to Google search a term on a relative basis. In this case, just because a particular city, say Minneapolis, didn’t rank in the top ten, it could mean Minneapolis residents don’t use Google to search for social networking information (maybe Yahoo? MSN?). They may also use a different phrase or term to search for social networking information (social media? Facebook?). Another caveat: I suspect Google hasn’t worked out all the bugs in the data just yet, but they’re not letting on. Case in point: On August 7, I used Google Insights for Search to track regional interest by state for the term “social networking” in the last 12 months On August 8, just 24 hours later, I ran the same search, and the results were significantly different. Why the big differences in the ranking and the scores, especially if the results captured data from the last 12 months? Small sample size? Data glitch? Human error? Maybe it was an issue at my end with my Internet connection. Perhaps I misunderstood something? A difference of one day shouldn’t make that much of an impact in the rankings, right? My suspicion is that Google launched this application only a day or so before and they’re still tinkering with its algorithms and ranking systems. The designers should get a pass on this one, but we should be on the lookout for similar inconsistencies in the future. If a year or even six months from now, we’re seeing the same kind of significant fluctuations in day to day results for the same search over a one year period or longer, it may be time to raise some red flags. New York Leads Nation in Googling “Facebook” The application was also used to track Google search statistics for leading social networking brands in the last 12 months. At a state level, Google searches for the brand “Facebook” were highest in New York, Arkansas and Connecticut. At a city level, searches were highest in New York City, Sterling and Milpitas. California Leads Nation in Googling “YouTube” At a state level, Google searches for the brand “YouTube” were highest in California, Virginia and Hawaii in the last 12 months. At a metro level, searches were highest in Milpitas, Sterling and Los Angeles. Oregon Leads Nation in Googling “Twitter” At a state level, Google searches for the brand “Twitter” were highest in Oregon, California and Washington in the last 12 months. Clearly, the Pacific North West and the West Coast love Twitter. At a city level, searches were highest in San Francisco, Austin and San Jose. California Leads Nation in Googling “Mashable” At a state level, Google searches for the brand “Mashable” were highest in California, New York and Texas in the last 12 months. Beyond these three states, search volume was not sufficient enough to show results. At a city level, searches were highest in San Francisco and New York. Search volume was not high enough to get results from any other cities. Insights for Search: A New Data Frontier These findings illustrate that Google Insights for Search is an amazing new application for social networking pros of all stripes. While not without its quirks, the tool is quite literally a mind reader that allows researchers to peer into the brains and online activity patterns of Google users. While the tool was designed to help online marketers create more and better AdWords marketing campaigns, I suspect the resource will be deployed for so much more. It will be used for everything from environmental scans to trend spotting to brand tracking and countless other applications that Google hasn’t yet planned or maybe ever imagined. Perhaps this is a stretch, but the new database (which is updated daily) has seismic implications for the forecasting of consumer behavior and business investment. It could completely revolutionize the way economists measure and track personal and corporate spending intentions. Currently, the gathering of intention data is done by written or phone surveys which are fraught with issues. Sample sizes may be low or not truly representative. People or organizations conducting the surveys may be biased. Those being surveyed may be less than honest or complete in their responses. Not here. Users want something. Users search for that something in Google. Google delivers information on that something. That’s it. It’s pure. No messy survey gets in the way. No agenda. No ego. Google never blinks. For better or worse, Google captures it all from hundreds of millions of users all over the world, countless times a day. No survey can do that. Experimenting with this tool, I feel like an ADD kid again. I’m tinkering with different keywords and phrase combinations like some digital Rubik’s cube, and going wild playing with the different geographic, time, and industry filters. On a whim (and strictly out of professional curiosity of course), I checked which U.S. state led the nation in googling the term “sex” during the last 30 days. Answer: South Dakota. For the term “Britney”: Louisiana. The term “Obama”: District of Columbia. The word “carpet”: Colorado. The phrase “air conditioning”: Arizona. The word “babysitter”: Ohio. I’ve barely started, and my head is already spinning with ideas on how this data can be used in business plans, Powerpoint presentations, sales pitches, brainstorming sessions, concept testing or for just plain fun. Not to sound ungrateful or greedy, but I’m already preparing a wish list of upgrades for Google Insights for Search 2.0. How about including a filter for time, not just for dates? In the last 30 days, the tool revealed that Phoenix led the nation in googling the term “pizza.” That’s great, but could you add another filter which identifies search volumes for specific times (3-4 pm? 7-8pm ? 10-11pm), particular days (Friday? Saturday) or even exact dates (March 14, 2008) for a word or phrase? Could you take the data that’s currently available in the Google Web History for individual users, and aggregate and publish the data for all Google users? This would allow researchers to scan search volumes by the different types of Google searches, say, Web, images, news, products, sponsored links, video, maps, blogs, and books? Could you arrange a meeting with the YouTube folks down the hall and create a comparable “YouTube Insights for Search” application that provides comparable search volume data for YouTube searches? And while you’re at it, why not spring for lunch and invite the Facebook and Twitter suits to the Googleplex? While you’re chowing down, explore the feasibility of creating a “Facebook Insights for Search” and/or “Twitter Insights for Search” that provides a database of Facebook and Twitter search volumes and activity patterns, also broken by location, date, times and location. I can already hear the thunder of privacy advocates banging their war drums, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. Perhaps I’m thinking too far ahead, but the point is that Google Insights for Search is a flawed but still spectacular new research tool for business and Web analysts everywhere.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who says that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease?  Wilfred Glendon is a wealthy and world-renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time. Unfortunately Dr. Yogami, who is revealed to be a werewolf, sneaks into the lab ahead of his rival and steals the only two blossoms. As the third has not bloomed, Glendon is out of luck.

Answer the question below:   If an animal is able to eat food easier is it more or less likely to reproduce more or less?    Assuming that:  Natural selection is the process by which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring, so their traits become more common over time. Answer:","output":"Based on the assumption provided, an animal that is able to eat food easier (indicating better foraging or hunting abilities, more efficient digestion, or a broader range of food sources) would be more likely to reproduce more. This is because having an advantage in acquiring and processing food resources would enable the animal to have a better overall health, increased energy levels, and improved body condition. These factors contribute to higher reproductive fitness by allowing the animal to allocate more resources to reproduction, attract better mates, and provide better care and protection for their offspring. As a result, the beneficial traits related to feeding efficiency would be passed on to the next generations through increased reproduction rates. Over time, these traits would become more common in the population due to the process of natural selection. In summary, an animal that can eat food easier is more likely to reproduce more, leading to these advantageous traits becoming more widespread in the population."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a context tweet, a question and corresponding answer of given question.

CONTEXT: Historia  A lo largo de la historia de Roma, el núcleo de su ejército estuvo constituido por la legión romana. Este cuerpo, que experimentó una gran evolución a lo largo de los siglos, acabó convirtiéndose en una unidad prácticamente invencible cuando luchaba en un terreno adecuado y estaba dirigida por un comandante diligente. No obstante, la legión contaba con una serie de deficiencias importantes, entre las que destacaban la falta de caballería y arqueros. Alrededor del año 200 a. C., una legión romana estaba formada por 4200 soldados de infantería y solo 300 de caballería. Esta alarmante escasez de jinetes entre las filas romanas se debía principalmente al pequeño porcentaje de ciudadanos que podía permitirse comprar y mantener a un caballo; los únicos que podían hacerlo pertenecían al ordo equester, la segunda clase más alta de la sociedad romana de la época, solo superada por el ordo senatorial.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who designed the monument that had an inscription removed in 1830? from the following article ?  Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which...

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  A bird hatches from an egg - The bird is nurtured by its parents - And is fed food for growth - The bird grows - Begins to learn how to fly - The bird matures - The bird leaves its nest Answer:","output":"The final step of the process, after the bird matures and leaves its nest, is for the bird to establish its independence and begin its adult life. This stage includes finding a territory, developing its skills further for survival, finding a mate, and ultimately reproducing, thereby continuing the life cycle of the species. In more detail, here are the key aspects of the final step in this process: 1. Establishing a territory: Upon leaving the nest, the bird will typically look for a territory that provides a suitable habitat for its survival. This includes finding an area with an adequate food supply, suitable nesting sites, and shelter from predators and harsh weather conditions. The bird will often engage in territorial behaviors, such as singing and defending its chosen area, to establish and maintain its territory. 2. Developing survival skills: As the bird establishes its independence, it will continue to refine the essential skills it needs to survive in the wild. These skills include effective foraging for food, avoiding or defending against potential predators, and adapting to various weather conditions and environments. 3. Social interactions and mating: After establishing its own territory, the bird will begin interacting with other individuals of its species. This may involve forming bonds with other birds, engaging in courtship rituals, and eventually finding a mate. Birds use various strategies to attract a partner, from elaborate displays of plumage and vocalizations to choreographed dances. 4. Reproducing: Once the bird has successfully found a mate, it will engage in the process of reproduction. This involves building a nest suitable for laying eggs, protecting the eggs, and incubating them until they hatch. Depending on the species, the parents may share the responsibility of incubation and attending to the eggs. 5. Parental care and nurturing: After the eggs have hatched, the bird will return to the earlier steps in the process by nurturing and caring for its young, similar to the experience it had with its own parents. This will involve feeding the hatchlings, keeping them warm, and protecting them from danger. As the young birds grow, they will start to learn the necessary skills to become independent, such as foraging for food and learning to fly. 6. Cycle continuation: The cycle continues as the newly hatched birds mature, learn to fly, eventually leave their nests, and begin their own independent lives. In conclusion, the final step of the process for a bird is its transition into adulthood and independence, where it establishes its territory, hones its survival skills, finds a mate, reproduces, and provides care for its offspring, thus continuing the cycle for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, and Low village is situated in a valley, and has more sunny days.  Which village has more dangerous cycling conditions?  Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Answer:","output":"Hill village has more dangerous cycling conditions due to its location on a mountain with lots of rain, which can create slippery conditions and increase the risk of loss of control for cyclists, especially those riding brakeless and using the drivetrain to slow down or skid.

Understand the context and meaning of the words in the tweet. 2. Analyze the tone and emotional content of the tweet. 3. Label the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on the analysis. Step 1: Understanding the context and meaning The phrase \\"truth hurts\\" refers to the idea that facts - even if they're accurate or truthful - can sometimes be painful or upsetting for those who hear or learn about them. The speaker is likely acknowledging the difficulty or emotional impact that comes with facing the truth. Step 2: Analyzing the tone and emotional content The tone of the tweet appears to be quite matter-of-fact, yet the statement implies a negative emotional response - specifically, pain or discomfort - as a response to the truth. It suggests that the speaker accepts the notion that truth can be harmful or unpleasant, but this acceptance doesn't necessarily negate the emotional impact it may have. Step 3: Labeling the sentiment Considering the meaning and tone of the tweet, it seems best to label the sentiment as negative.

Halloween costumes - what not to wear ‘The golden rule is to be scary and gruesome, not gratuitously cruel.’ Photograph: Nisarg Lakhmani/Demotix/Corbis Oh for the time when Halloween costumes were, first and foremost, about being scary. The ancient superstition of 31 October was still lingering, just about, during my childhood in Wales. We'd dress up as either ghouls or witches to trick or treat for Noson Calan Gaeaf, the night before winter. How I long for those days when even chubby children were given sweets, rather than a harshly worded letter regarding obesity addressed to their parents. Nowadays, many a purist complains that the festival's creepy, pagan roots are being forgotten in favour of such activities as competitive pumpkin carving, E-number quaffing, eggy neighbour-bothering, and fatuous readymade Miley Cyrus costume wearing, a trend for which we can only blame those pesky Americans. So what to wear? With the advent of the internet, the choosing of a Halloween costume has become a loaded activity. The right choice carries the potential of bearing witness to the birth of a legend and the wrong one could render you the subject or an irate Gawker post accessed by millions. This has upped the ante somewhat. Forget your mum cutting holes in a sheet or the classic donning of a last-minute bin bag, when you've got costume over-achiever Heidi Klum dressed as the Hindu goddess Kali, a full-feathered raven, the apple of temptation, or Lady Godiva complete with horse (the list goes on). And don't bother with those plastic witches' hats with the fake green hair attached. That is so 90s, babes, not to mention insensitive towards all our sister witches persecuted for their beliefs. Even Private Eye wouldn't resort to such sexist cliches. It's time to tear up the rulebook and start again with these new rules: If you're wondering how soon is too soon, then chances are it's too soon. The British penchant for tasteless Halloween costumes seems to be going from strength to strength (see last year's plethora of Jimmy Saviles) and there are some people who it will never, ever, be OK to dress as. Then again, there are also certain real-life monsters who were so awful and frightening that they have rendered themselves deserving of a Halloween costume – provided a certain grace period has passed, naturally. Remember, the golden rule is to be scary and gruesome, not gratuitously cruel. This advice was sadly not followed by a distant acquaintance of mine (and can I use this opportunity to stress just how distant) who was ejected from a party for being dressed as Harold Shipman – by a girl whose elderly relative had been murdered by the doctor. Look! It's a baby! Dressed up as a lobster! In a pot! For the entertainment of adults! Not to get all PC brigade on you, but is this really so hard? Can't you just put down that native American headdress? (I can see you. Put. It. Down). By all means go as a character from another race, it is possible to do this sensitively, but an Arab or a Mexican is not a Halloween costume. Also, fancy dress should never, ever, involve the wearing of blackface. I don't care how much you love Obama. I can't believe I'm even having to say this in 2013, but this is the year that some reprehensible asshat thought going as Trayvon Martin would be pop culture hilarious, so clearly we still have aeons of progress to work through. There's nothing more annoying than having to repeatedly explain your costume to strangers. \\"I'm the human immunodeficiency virus,\\" you mutter to your drinking companion, as people stare at you in disgust. Saying it out loud makes it less funny, somehow. Though unfunny is perhaps preferable to incomprehensible obscurity. Pretentious can be fun provided its enacted literally (see this Freudian slip) or looks beautiful, as in the case of this Van Gogh. Going as someone or something that's been making headlines shows other people just how much of a plugged-in, switched-on, politically aware Guardianista you are. Take this jumper bearing the slogan \\"David Cameron told me to wear this\\", or this \\"Man who hated Britain\\" hat. I also forsee \\"dead badger\\" being a popular choice. Time to confront head-on the line made infamous by Tina Fey: \\"Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and none of the other girls can say a word about it.\\" From the 90s onwards, lingerie paired with animal ears became a legit costume choice for women, and the sheer range of sexy costumes on the market is staggering. I'm not about to slut shame you for wanting to be the \\"office tramp\\", a \\"sexy chewbacca\\", or even the \\"sexy pizza\\" made famous by the Daily Show last week. But a friend who dashed down to Ann Summers to pick up a maid's costume found herself fielding repeated requests for vodka from inebriated men who assumed she was a shot girl rather than a guest, which clearly would not have happened had she gone to Take Back Halloween – \\"a costume guide for women with imagination\\" – and copied their incredible Baba Yaga costume. Which of course she would never do, because Baba Yaga is dead ugly and sometimes looking sexy is fun. Freedom lies in having options. Options that don't make people cry on the best night out of the year, except maybe with laughter. Which is why I'll be going as a false widow spider. With stockings and suspenders, obviously. Have a good one. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Halloween costumes, particularly focusing on what not to wear for this festive event. It starts by reminiscing about the past when Halloween costumes were primarily about being scary, reflecting Halloween's creepy, pagan roots. However, it states that the situation has evolved with costumes now having the potential either to make a person a legend or a subject of ridicule. The article suggests some rules regarding the choice of Halloween costume. It posits that if someone is questioning whether a costume is timely or appropriate, it's probably not. It mentions the need for avoiding gratuitously cruel or insensitive choices. Examples include dressing up as controversial figures who are directly linked to harm or traumatic events, particularly if it's too soon after the events took place. The article insists on the importance of being sensitive when dressing as characters from other ethnic or racial backgrounds. It discourages the use of blackface, and other ethnic stereotypes, which are considered culturally insensitive and offensive. The notion is reinforced with instances of offensive costumes, such as an individual dressed as Trayvon Martin, underscoring the need for further societal progress in this regard. The writer also cautions about costumes that are too obscure or complicated, as having to explain one's costume repeatedly could be frustrating. The choice to dress as someone making current headlines is also discussed as it may be seen as a demonstration of being socially and politically aware. Furthermore, the article discusses the trend of ‘sexy’ Halloween costumes, opposing the idea of slut-shaming anyone who chooses to wear one. However, it points out the risk of misunderstanding or misidentifying the costume, which might lead to awkward situations. Finally, the writer implores the readers not to forget the spirit of fun inherent to Halloween. Costumes should be chosen wisely, considering the potential to cause distress or offense. And most importantly, Halloween costumes should offer individuals the freedom and creativity to enjoy the event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Lauren Bernardy, 17, of Orange County was on the campus lacrosse field for a summer sports camp when water began flooding the field.            \\"All of a sudden there's water rushing and we had to grab our things. We just started running and we were being chased by water,\\" she said.            Lauren said there is a parking structure under the lacrosse field and track and field stadium, and many cars were trapped by the rushing water. She watched several cars try to drive out of the water but wind up trapped.            Within five minutes, she said, the water had rushed from the edge of the lacrosse field to the Drake track stadium, which was submerged. Other students near Pauley Pavilion could be seen walking in shin-deep water, she said. ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — A broken water main near the UCLA campus Tuesday sent a geyser of water some 30 feet into the air, trapping people in underground parking garages and covering some of the best-known parts of campus in water, including the school's famed basketball arena.

(Associated Press)      Water cascades down a stairway to a parking structure adjacent to Pauley Pavlion, home of UCLA basketball, background, after a 30-inch water main burst on nearby Sunset Boulevard Tuesday, July 29, 2014,... (Associated Press)      The 30-inch, 93-year-old pipe that broke under nearby Sunset Boulevard made a raging river of the street and sent millions of gallons of water across the school's athletic facilities, including the famed floor of Pauley Pavilion, as well as a pair of parking structures that took the brunt of the damage.      The arena — where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Reggie Miller and Kevin Love starred and John Wooden coached for 10 years — recently underwent a 132 million renovation that was completed in October 2012. At least an inch of water covered the floor Tuesday night, and its locker rooms were also flooded.      \\"It's painful. It's painful,\\" UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said at a news conference. \\"We just refurbished Pauley just a few years ago. And it's a beautiful structure. It's of course, a symbolic structure for this entire campus.\\"      Administrative Vice Chancellor Jack Powazek said the school may need to make contingency plans, but \\"luckily we're not in the middle of basketball season.\\"      The water break came amid a severe drought in California, where under new regulations residents are subject to fines up to 500 a day for wasting water.      Firefighters, some using inflatable boats, saved at least five people who were stranded in the underground parking structures.      People saw the water and started rushing down the stairwells to rescue their cars, and authorities had to keep them out as water rose up to the wheel wells of vehicles, many of which were stranded, city fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said.      Firefighters have been searching cars in the structures to make sure nobody was still inside, Humphrey said. No injuries have been reported.      As many as 100 cars were stranded in the garages, officials said.      Beth Schoenborn, 49, and her daughter Kelly Schoenborn, 17, of Portland, Oregon, were on a campus tour that was brought to a halt when the water started flowing.      Their rental car was in one of the flooded parking structures. They got to it and started driving but couldn't exit because a dip was blocked by water.      \\"We moved it up to the highest point,\\" Beth Schoenborn said as she stood outside the parking structure.      The water pipe, which carries 75,000 gallons per minute when it's functioning, broke at about 3:30 p.m. and was shut off about 3 1/2 hours later, Department of Water and Power spokesman Jim McDaniel said. An estimated 8 million to 10 million gallons were released, McDaniel said.      \\"Unfortunately, we lost a lot of water, around 35,000 gallons a minute, which is not ideal in the worst drought in the city's history,\\" City Councilman Paul Koretz said, \\"so we ask everybody to try harder to conserve water.\\"      Three buildings were damaged. In addition to Pauley Pavilion, the Wooden Center, which has training facilities for students, and the J.D. Morgan Center, which houses the school's sports trophies and athletics offices was also flooded.      Fire and police officials swarmed the chaotic scene that featured helicopters hovering overhead and backpack-bearing students wading across campus in ankle-deep water. Meanwhile, some fun-seekers went in the water with body boards.      Patrick Huggins and Matthew Bamberger, two 18-year-olds who live in nearby Westwood, said they were having a boring summer day until Huggins' mother told them about the water.      \\"It was about up to my thigh, and I thought this is a good day for a little dip,\\" Huggins said.      The two shot video of themselves diving and splashing in the badly flooded practice putting green used by the golf team.      Paul Phootrakul of the UCLA Alumni Association, who was in business attire for an evening event, took off his dress shoes and dress socks, and rolled up his slacks in an attempt to wade to his car. Firefighters stopped him, saying the parking structure was not steady because of the weight of all the water.      \\"I was trying to move my car without getting wet so I'm presentable for this event,\\" he said. \\"I definitely know that the cars on the bottom floor, my best bet, are gone or totaled. I don't have much hope for my car.\\"      ___      Associated Press writers Bob Jablon, Beth Harris and Krysta Fauria contributed to this story. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A broken water main near the UCLA campus caused a massive flood, trapping people in underground parking garages and covering parts of the campus in water, including the school's basketball arena.

The town's first significant defences were likely erected due to commercial interests, following the temporary seizure of St. John's by the Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter in June 1665. The inhabitants were able to fend off a second Dutch attack in 1673, when this time it was defended by Christopher Martin, an English merchant captain. Martin landed six cannons from his vessel, the Elias Andrews, and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour. With only twenty-three men, the valiant Martin beat off an attack by three Dutch warships. The English government planned to expand these fortifications (Fort William) in around 1689, but actual construction didn't begin until after the French admiral Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville captured and destroyed the town in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign (1696). When 1500 English reinforcements arrived in late 1697 they found nothing but rubble where the town and fortifications had stood.

Question: This article: Stanford wrote of Bennett: He maintained his British characteristics throughout his life ...The English take a kind of pride in concealing their feelings and emotions, and this is reflected in their folk-song. The Thames has no rapids and no falls; it winds along under its woods in a gentle stream, never dry and never halting; it is the type of the spirit of English folkmusic ... England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley. W. B. Squire wrote in 1885: His sense of form was so strong, and his refined nature so abhorred any mere seeking after effect, that his music sometimes gives the impression of being produced under restraint. He seldom, if ever, gave rein to his unbridled fancy; everything is justly proportioned, clearly defined, and kept within the limits which the conscientiousness of his self-criticism would not let him overstep. It is this which makes him, as has been said, so peculiarly a musician's composer: the broad effects and bold contrasts which an uneducated public admires are absent; it takes an educated audience to appreciate to the full the exquisitely refined and delicate nature of his genius. Temperley suggests that, despite his reverence for Mendelssohn, Bennett took Mozart as his model. Geoffrey Bush agrees that \\"[h]is best work, like his piano playing, was full of passion none the less powerful for being Mozartian (that is to say, perfectly controlled)\\", and characterizes him as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who Geoffery Bush characterizes as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\"?, what is it ?

Since you won't be adding sugar and salt to the food, it's important to choose ripe produce - otherwise, it will taste bland. Look for produce that is brightly colored and ripe without being too soft or bruised. Follow individual guides for each type of fruit and vegetable to determine when specific items are ripe.   Farmer's markets are great places to find fresh produce at its peak, since they tend to stock only fruits and vegetables that are in season. You can use frozen or canned fruits and vegetables, but it's better to use fresh whenever possible. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables often have additives to help preserve them. Read the label carefully if you decide to buy frozen or canned vegetables. Many fresh fruits and vegetables are treated with pesticides and other chemicals before they are harvested. If possible, shop in the organic section of your supermarket so you can be sure the food you make for your baby is chemical-free. Some fruits and vegetables are more apt to become contaminated by fruits and vegetables than others. For example, apples are treated with more pesticides than any other produce, so you may want to go out of your way to buy organic apples. Avocados, on the other hand, aren't treated with as many pesticides.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e6/Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/v4-459px-Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/e/e6/Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/aid1330600-v4-728px-Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":306,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"485\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Some babies are ready to start eating solid food as early as 4 months old, while others aren't quite ready that early.

Life seems bleak for Eddie and Richie, until it seemingly improves with the arrival of the \\"Nice family\\", headed by Mr Nice, and the famous Italian actress Gina Carbonara.  Gina's decision to stay in the grotty house is primarily down to her need to seek safety from her ill-tempered fiancé Gino Bolognese. However, thanks to the pair putting her names in lights outside the guest house to attract more guests, Gino eventually finds her. Forced to cook meals for the guest, Richie comes across some fish which fell off a military lorry, heading away from the nearby nuclear power station. Unknown to both him and Eddie, the fish had been contaminated by a radiation leak due to the power station's poor maintenance.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Smash hits performed by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley in the forties or fifties, or Rihanna and Justin Bieber today, were often penned by professionals. Even internationally-acclaimed singer Adele, whose new album, 25, comes out today, and whose last - 21 - sold more than 30 million copies, co-writes her material. Not that record labels like to crow about songwriters - most of these hired guns are virtually unknown outside the industry. But are these powers behind the throne seeing their livelihoods threatened by music videos and digital streaming? Many fear so. What all professional songwriters have in common is a publishing deal, and like the recorded music industry, music publishing is worth billions globally. But the switch to buying and listening to music in digital rather than physical form has dented revenues, and not just because of piracy - file-sharing that infringes copyright. Jane Dyball, chief executive of the Music Publishers Association (MPA), says that while streaming is not a bad thing in itself, there are concerns about whether the advertising revenue generated by platforms such as YouTube and Spotify is sufficient to ensure fair returns to writers as well as to artists and record companies. \\"Someone suggested they should be called music-supported advertising services rather than advertising-supported music services,\\" Ms Dyball quips. If a song is streamed a million times, there should be one million payments in return, Ms Dyball says - a concept the industry calls \\"pay per play\\". That is similar to Spotify's business model, but not that of YouTube, which gathers the revenue generated by advertising into a pool and then distributes it to rights holders. The problem is, critics say, YouTube is parsimonious in the extreme. \\"It's now time for YouTube to show that it is going to generate revenue back to the industry that reflects the amount of music its users consume,\\" says Ms Dyball. If you can get music for free via YouTube, why pay for subscription services such as Spotify - which now has 20 million paying users - or Apple Music - which has 6.5 million paying subscribers? There is also disquiet about SoundCloud, a German music streaming platform. The industry body PRS for Music - which collects royalties for more than 111,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers - says it lacks a licence to play music in the UK and is taking legal action against Soundcloud for unpaid royalties. Mark Lawrence, chief executive of the Association for Electronic Music, told Music Business Worldwide he hopes it will mean that \\"one writer and/or one artist getting one play can be confident of earning one payment, however small\\". Robert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, says times are good for successful artists who write their own material - like Ed Sheeran - but believes things are more difficult for less well-known writers. With album sales dwindling in favour of individual song downloads, budding songwriters have to hope their songs are streamed by music fans in the face of competition from the millions already available. And the royalties earned from streaming can be minuscule. Kevin Kadish, co-writer of the Meghan Trainor smash hit, All About That Bass, says he earned just 5,679 from 178 million streams of the song. The video has been watched more than 1.1 billion times on YouTube. Singer Taylor Swift successfully forced Apple Music to reverse policy and pay artists for music streamed during trial periods of its music service, saying it was \\"unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing\\". Mr Ashcroft says that paid-for streaming can be a viable replacement for downloads, but only if the problem of under-licensed - by which he means YouTube - and un-licensed platforms - Soundcloud - can be addressed. \\"Spotify is not the problem - the problem is that the legal playing field is not level,\\" he says. Meanwhile the music publishing business seems to be stalling. The world's biggest music publisher is Sony/ATV, which also owns the EMI publishing business and the rights to the Beatles' back catalogue, had revenues of about 660m (Â£435m) in the first half of 2015 - a sum as high as the combined turnover of rivals Universal Music Publishing and Warner/Chappell. Despite this, Sony, which has co-owned the publishing joint venture with the estate of Michael Jackson since 1995, wants to sell its stake. In a leaked email, Sony chief financial officer, Kenichiro Yoshida, wrote that the publishing business is complex and \\"is impacted by the market shift to streaming\\". Even when songwriters do generate some income from their tunes, they can often wait up to two years for payment, as antiquated systems struggle to cope in the digital age - PRS says the number of individual music plays has risen from 15 million a year five years ago to one trillion. PRS is now part of a new pan-European licensing system called ICE that will more accurately match songwriters, composers and publishers of pieces of music to ensure rights holders get paid more speedily - describing it the biggest revolution in the history of music copyright. The world of music will always need songwriters, but until the economics of the industry are recalibrated fairly for the digital age, their songs may struggle to be heard.","output":"This is a story about people who write songs that singers like Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber sing. These talented writers can make a lot of money from their songs, but nowadays they might be making less because of music being mainly on the computer. That's because websites like YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud make money differently, and sometimes the songwriters don't get as much money from it. A lot of songwriters are a bit worried about this, and they want these websites to pay them more fairly. In the end, we all love and need music, so it's important to make sure people who write the songs have a fair chance to keep doing it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The aging rockstar had to finally stop playing guitar, as his hands just wouldn't cooperate because of arthritis. This option is in line with common sense as arthritis is a joint disorder characterized by inflammation, pain, and stiffness.

The other options do not make logical sense in this context: - Singing: This option is unrelated to the physical ability of the rockstar to play the guitar. Singing is a vocal activity and does not directly affect the hands of the performer. - Listening to music: Listening to music is a passive activity that has no direct bearing on the physical condition of the rockstar's hands. It would not cause issues with playing the guitar. - Making music: This option is somewhat ambiguous, as it could encompass various aspects of creating music.

Both sentences describe the birth and death locations of an individual. In both cases, the person was born in Gollnow, Pomerania, and died in Dahme, Brandenburg.

Another small difference can be observed in the way the commas are placed in the second sentence. There are two commas surrounding the word \\"and,\\" which set off the word \\"Pomerania.\\" This is an instance of using an appositive that renames or explains the noun, \\"Gollnow.\\" In contrast, the first sentence does not frame \\"Pomerania\\" as an appositive, as it omits the second comma. However, this is only a minor variation in punctuation that does not alter the essential content of the message.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"An increase in pollution due to more animal farming can potentially affect the growth of trees in several ways. Examining the impact of this pollution on the process mentioned, we can categorize it as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Increased animal farming contributes to pollution in a few different ways including the release of greenhouse gases (such as methane and carbon dioxide), air pollution through the release of ammonia and other harmful odors, and the potential contamination of water sources. Let's analyze the impact of each on the growth of trees. 1. Greenhouse gases: While an increase in carbon dioxide levels can be beneficial for photosynthesis, excessive levels pose a threat to the environment and subsequently the trees. Climate change caused by the increased presence of greenhouse gases can lead to changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and other factors affecting trees' growth. 2. Air pollution: The release of ammonia and other harmful gases can drastically affect the quality of the air, which in turn indirectly impacts the process of photosynthesis. Inhaling poor-quality air can obstruct the stomata, making it difficult for trees to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. This can lead to a reduction in their overall growth potential. 3. Water contamination: More animal farming often results in increased waste production, leading to polluted water sources. As trees require clean water to thrive, polluted water, absorbed by their roots, can impair their growth. Moreover, water contamination disturbs the balance of various nutrients essential for healthy trees. In summary, more animal farming increases pollution, which in turn indirectly affects certain steps of the tree growth process. While none of the process steps are directly influenced, increased pollution can harm the overall health of trees, resulting in reduced growth rates and long-term consequences for the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

În contextul în care țara a încercat să facă față crizei și să restabilească stabilitatea economică, guvernul a impus măsuri de austeritate pentru a restrânge cheltuielile și a reduce deficitul bugetar. Acest lucru a dus la tăieri ale salariilor și pensiilor, înghețarea posturilor și reduceri ale programelor sociale.  Augustin Cozma, un cetățean român care a lucrat, probabil, o mare parte din viața sa pentru a-și asigura un trai decent în perioada pensionării, a fost direct afectat de aceste măsuri. Nemulțumit de efectele negative ale acestora asupra nivelului său de trai și al altor pensionari, precum și a efectelor pe termen lung asupra economiei, societății și guvernului, el a decis să se alăture protestelor din Piața Universității.

Title: Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior Movie plot: With supplies of petroleum nearly exhausted in the near future following a major energy crisis and a global nuclear war, ex-Main Force Patrol officer \\"Mad\\" Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) roams the now-depopulated and desolate desert in his scarred, black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special several years after the events of the first film, scavenging for food, water, and fuel. His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a rare functioning firearm â a sawn-off shotgun â for which ammunition is very scarce. While trying to escape a group of gang members â led by a crazed motorcycle rider named Wez (Vernon Wells) - Max manages to crash two of the gang members' vehicles and injure Wez; recognising his defeat, Wez flees. After collecting some fuel from the destroyed cars and checking a nearby Mack semi, Max inspects a nearby autogyro for fuel. Its pilot, the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), ambushes Max and manages to capture him briefly before being overpowered. In exchange for his own life, the pilot guides Max to a small oil refinery nearby. Max arrives to see the facility is under siege by a gang of marauders riding a motley collection of cars and motorbikes. The gang leader, known as \\"Lord Humungus\\" (Kjell Nilsson), tries to convince the refinery's defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area. A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound, but the marauders capture, torture, and kill all but one of them, who is rescued by Max. Max makes a deal with the mortally-wounded sole survivor: he will bring him back to the compound in exchange for a tank of fuel. The man dies shortly after they enter the facility, and the facility leader, Pappagallo (Michael Preston), reneges on the deal, saying it died when the survivor died. His group is on the verge of killing Max when the marauders return, and Humungus repeats his offer. When the Feral Kid (Emil Minty) kills Wez's male companion, Wez becomes enraged, urging his leader to take the compound; Humungus wrestles Wez...

Which animal is the symbol of the Rastafarian religion?","output":"To find out which animal is the symbol of the Rastafarian religion, I will need to analyze the key elements and symbols of the Rastafarian culture. So, let's think about this step by step: 1. Rastafarianism is a religion that originated in Jamaica in the 1930s. It was greatly influenced by the African culture due to the roots of its followers, the descendants of enslaved Africans. Consequently, it is likely that the symbol of the Rastafarian religion might have connections to Africa. 2. One of the primary colors associated with the Rastafarian religion is green, which represents the lush vegetation of Jamaica and Africa. Therefore, we can presume that the symbol may be related to an animal that is native to those regions. 3. Rastafarianism places great emphasis on natural living – a lack of materialism, self-sufficiency, and an appreciation of the natural world. Therefore, it's possible that the symbol may be an animal closely associated with nature and the natural world. Based on these considerations, the lion, specifically the Lion of Judah, is the animal that is most often associated with the Rastafarian religion. The Lion of Judah originates from the Biblical tribe of Judah and is a symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy. This connection to Africa, the natural world, and the Rastafarian belief in repatriation to Africa, all contribute to the lion being an important symbol within the Rastafarian religion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But Eliza Parsons was still at Elmhurst the next day, calmly pursuing her duties, and evidently having forgotten or decided to ignore the young man who had so curiously mistaken her for another. Beth took occasion to watch her movements, so far as she could, and came to the conclusion that the girl was not acting a part. She laughed naturally and was too light-hearted and gay to harbor a care of any sort in her frivolous mind.  But there was a mystery about her; that could not be denied. Even if she were but a paid spy of Erastus Hopkins there was a story in this girl's life, brief as it had been.  Beth was full of curiosity to know this story.  As for Tom Gates, he had been so horrified by his mistake that he tried to avoid meeting Eliza again. This was not difficult because the girl kept pretty closely to the linen room, and Tom was chiefly occupied in the library.  Kenneth had little chance to test his secretary's abilities just then, because the girls pounced upon the new recruit and used his services in a variety of ways. Tom Gates's anxiety to give satisfaction made him willing to do anything, but they refrained from sending him often to town because he was sensitive to the averted looks and evident repulsion of those who knew he had recently been a \\"jail-bird.\\" But there was plenty for him to do at Elmhurst, where they were all as busy as bees; and whatever the young man undertook he accomplished in a satisfactory manner.  1.

A servomotor is a motor, very often sold as a complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.

In his first television interview since the election, the former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” that he was convinced he’d win until Ohio’s vote came in, and that he damaged his campaign by failing to attract black and Hispanic voters and speaking too freely in his infamous “47 percent” comments.      Text Size -      +      reset Ann Romney on Senate run      Romney’s wife, Ann, blamed the media and Obama’s campaign for offering what she described as an unfairly skewed vision of her husband.      (PHOTOS: Mitt Romney through the years)      Both Romneys said he would be more effective at navigating the current political moment.      “I’ll look at what’s happening right now, I wish I were there,” Mitt Romney said. “It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done. The president is the leader of the nation. The president brings people together, does the deals, does the trades, knocks the heads together; the president leads. And — and I don’t see that kind of — of leadership happening right now.”      Romney, like congressional Republicans, accused Obama of “campaigning” rather than governing as the sequester loomed. That, Romney said, has been counterproductive.      “Well, no one can think that that’s been a success for the president,” Romney said. “He didn’t think the sequester would happen. It is happening. To date, what we’ve seen is a — the president out campaigning to the American people, doing rallies around the country, flying around the country and berating Republicans and blaming and pointing. Now, what does that do? That causes the Republicans to — to retrench and to put up a wall and to fight back. It’s a very natural human emotion.”      Ann Romney said her husband, had he won, would have solved the sequester by now.      “I totally believe at this moment, if Mitt were there in the office, that we would not be facing sequestration right now,” she said.      Up until polls closed on Election Day, both Romneys were convinced they would be in the White House.      “Yeah, I think we were convinced that we would win,” Mitt Romney said.      Ann Romney said she had no doubt: “I for sure did. I think Mitt intellectually was thinking that it was possible we couldn’t; he knew how close it was.”      Only after he saw the Ohio numbers did Romney realize it would not be.      “It was a slow recognition until ultimately when the Ohio numbers began coming in and they were disappointing,” he said. “I said, look, this looks like we’ve lost — wasn’t certain. Some people said, ‘Oh, look, if this number here comes in, why, you could win.’ But you know, by 8 or 9 o’clock, it was pretty clear that we were not going to win.”      Romney called his inability to win black and Hispanic votes “a real weakness” and said future GOP candidates must do better. He blamed himself for the infamous “47 percent” comments and said he should have been more careful when speaking privately — as he thought he was at the fundraiser in Boca Raton, Fla.      “The weakness that our campaign had and that I had is we weren’t effective in — in taking my message primarily to minority voters, to Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, other minorities,” he said. “That was a real weakness. Uh, we did very well with the majority population, but not with minority populations. And — and that was a — that was a failing. That was a real mistake.” ||||| Mitt Romney says the long Republican primary was “unhelpful” in his quest to win the White House, but said it did not alter his ideological moorings.      Romney said in an interview aired Sunday on \\"Fox News Sunday\\" that he did not change his position to defeat opponents like Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, but the 2012 GOP presidential nominee said the intraparty attacks hurt his general election campaign.      “The idea that somehow it -- it -- that the primary made me become more conservative than I was just isn't - isn't accurate,” Romney said. “On the other hand, a long and blistering primary, where people are attacking one another and where the attacks sometimes are not on the mark but are creating an un -- you know, unfavorable impression, those things are not helpful.”      Read more about: Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Fox News Sunday, Rick Santorum |||||","output":"In a television interview four months after losing the presidential election to Barack Obama, Mitt Romney expressed frustration at not being in the White House and finding solutions to America's problems.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

Article: In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the foundation of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated 900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the west when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticising them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela. Question: Along with Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who was suspected of the attack on Pan Am Flight 103?","output":"Along with Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was suspected of the attack on Pan Am Flight 103. The bomb attack took place over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, resulting in the tragic loss of 243 passengers, 16 crew members, and 11 people on the ground. In November 1991, British police investigations identified these two Libyan individuals as the chief suspects and demanded that Libya hand them over. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi initially refused but eventually agreed upon the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands in 1998. This was a key event that led to the eventual suspension of United Nations-imposed economic sanctions against Libya."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: President Obama says tens of thousands of Central American children flooding into the U.S. along the southern border have created a “humanitarian crisis,” and he appealed directly to parents to stop sending kids north.      Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      “Our message absolutely is don't send your children unaccompanied, on trains or through a bunch of smugglers,” Obama told ABC’s Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive interview here. “We don't even know how many of these kids don't make it, and may have been waylaid into sex trafficking or killed because they fell off a train.      “Do not send your children to the borders,” he said. “If they do make it, they'll get sent back. More importantly, they may not make it.”      More of Stephanopoulos’ interview with the president will air on “Good Morning America” tomorrow and on “This Week” Sunday morning.      Obama: World Cup Impacting Some Foreign Policy Moves      The Department of Homeland Security says more than 52,000 unaccompanied minors have been detained along the U.S. border with Mexico this fiscal year. In addition, authorities have apprehended 39,000 adults with small children. The numbers reflect a significant uptick over last year, when just 24,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended. The majority in the surge hail from Central American countries, and a disproportionate number are young women and under age 13, officials say.      Under federal law, undocumented immigrant minors from countries other than Mexico cannot be immediately returned. Instead, U.S. authorities are required to process the children, then provide for their health care and other basic needs before releasing them to relatives or foster parents until they are to appear in an immigration court.      “If they come from a non-contiguous country, then there's a lengthy process,” Obama told Stephanopoulos.      Obama administration sources said this week that of the unaccompanied children who come into the U.S., historically more than 50 percent are placed with parents or family members in the U.S. and many are adopted by American families and remain.      Republican critics say lenient immigration policies under the administration – including the Deferred Action program, granting legal status to some undocumented youth already in the U.S., and a directive to prosecutors to focus on deporting criminal aliens – have exacerbated the problem.      But Obama said this year’s influx reflects “the desperation and the violence that exists in some of these Central American countries.” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Many members of Congress in both parties have expressed support for the idea, and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) are expected to introduce a bill to make the change soon. The Obama administration has also indicated support for this idea.      Here's what that would mean:      Children will have a single interview, with a Border Patrol agent, to prove they're afraid of persecution. Children would have one chance to persuade the government that they are afraid of persecution or trafficking: at the Border Patrol station, in an interview with a Border Patrol agent, right after they're apprehended.      \\"four-year-olds, standing before border patrol, trying to articulate a fear of persecution\\"      \\"It's targeting unaccompanied children who will be standing there alone,\\" says Wendy Young of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a group that advocates for unaccompanied migrant children.\\"Four-year-olds, standing before a Border Patrol station, trying to articulate a fear of persecution or a fear of trafficking. It's patently absurd to think the kids, in these circumstances, can successfully navigate that kind of screening.\\"      If they do navigate it successfully, they'll be put into the existing process: they'll be able to speak with an asylum officer or be put into immigration court proceedings, to determine officially if they qualify for legal status.      If they don't pass that interview, they'll be immediately sent back. If children can't persuade the Border Patrol agent that they'll be persecuted or trafficked, they'll be immediately returned to their home countries — not formally deported, but immediately sent back.      This might just apply to kids who are caught crossing the border in the future. What's still not clear is whether this new process is only going to be used for children who cross the border in the future, or whether it's also going to apply to the tens of thousands of children already in government custody. Young thinks that the administration is just trying to change the law for the future, rather than forcing Border Patrol agents to conduct mass screenings of all the children currently in their care. But without seeing the proposed bill, she can't be sure.      There's a slim chance there will be legal services provided to kids for their Border Patrol interviews — but it's unlikely. The administration has asked Congress to approve 3.7 billion in emergency funding for the migrant crisis, and that includes 15 million for \\"legal representation\\" for children. But Young doesn't know whether those legal services are for the Border Patrol screenings, or just for the children who make it through the Border Patrol interview and get into immigration court.      \\"I would hope, if you're going to be doing these screenings, at least make sure that the lawyer is standing by the side of the child,\\" she says. But again, without seeing the bill itself, it's difficult to tell.      It's an appropriate response for an immigration crisis, not a refugee crisis. Here's the upshot of the proposed bill: the laws on the books say that when unaccompanied children come across the border from Central America, the government's top priority should be making sure that they get due process in immigration court, and are able to live with family members while their cases are processed. Much of Congress and the Obama administration now believe that the government's top priority should be swiftly returning a child to his or her home country if it's not immediately clear that he or she deserves legal status here.      the administration now believes the top priority should be sending children back quickly, not guaranteeing due process      That means many policymakers see this as an immigration crisis — children coming to the United States because they can, for economic opportunity, family reunification, or to game the system. If that's the case, a crackdown will (in theory) deter families from sending their children, because the odds would no longer be in their favor.      It means they don't see it as a refugee crisis — children will now be assumed not to be in danger unless they can prove otherwise. But if families are currently sending children because they're genuinely convinced the children are in mortal danger, a crackdown won't have as much of a deterrent effect.      Just because a child can't immediately make it clear to a Border Patrol officer that he or she qualifies for legal status doesn't mean that he or she can't. So it's virtually certain that — if Congress agrees to change the law — children will be returned to their home countries who, had they arrived in the US last year, would ultimately have been given legal status on humanitarian grounds. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The article talks about a time when President Obama said that many children from Central America were coming into the United States, causing a problem. He asked parents not to send their children alone because it was dangerous and the children might not make it. If the children did make it, they would be sent back to their countries. This situation made people think about changing the laws to make it harder for these children to stay in the United States. Some people thought this was a good idea, while others thought it might not be fair for the children who were really in danger."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So, after 15 minutes of watching I've noticed that something is wrong with this movie; it's TERRIBLE! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious! I think that Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid, the movie would be funny...(So stupid, it's funny...? WRONG!) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as:\\"Fright Night\\", \\"The Lost Boys\\" and \\"The Return Of the Living Dead\\"! Those are funny! \\"Cabin Fever\\" is THE reason why I registered to www.IMDb.com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it. I've decided to watch the movie a second time >AAARGH!< and make notes for my partial \\"review\\" to show how foolish the movie is. \\"Resident Evil\\" (horror) or \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" (comedy) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But this...! How bad can a script and a director be??? This bad. Here are the awful scenes in chronological order: In the early scenes we see Henry, who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead! The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite people. And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question (\\"What's wrong with the woods?\\") is \\"nothing\\". The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for \\"suspense\\". Then the \\"smartest\\" of the 5-pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the \\"F-word\\". Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill. Bert:\\"Don't make me shoot you!\\" (he forgets to add: \\"...with my BB gun!\\") Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert doesn't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun. Later, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another weirdo shows up with his dog. (Maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about? It's filled with weirdos...and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this forgettable character...alive! Henry shows up at their cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows. The Fantastic Five come out running, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (*huh? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods???), a poker, and a (insecticide?) spray-can, ready to combat the single, unarmed and terribly sick man. (clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. \\"What else am I supposed to do?\\" Bert yells in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead. Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: \\"He's coming towards us!\\" (Thanks for the info, dumb broads, I can see that! But I don't think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy sprays in his eyes, making Henry yelp! And our \\"hero\\" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire, which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screaming. The following day, Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to \\"go for help\\" all by herself, in the woods, as Paul stays behind with Karen...Doesn't that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already \\"going for help\\"! I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she's going!? Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin saying:\\"Hello? Is anyone there?\\" Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first). And along comes Jeff, as well. How did THEY get here!? Did they swim across the river??? Do you see how brainless the script is!? Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin. He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out. (Before I take my own eyes out!...Now, THAT's funny!)

What is the full name of the artist who's greatest hits album did the lead singer of the band that tried to \\"remain somewhat grungy\\" give to the man that added layers of guitars to songs?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Recording sessions for the album began on October 31, 1988, at Downtown Recorders in Boston, Massachusetts, at the time a professional 24-track studio. 4AD allowed the Pixies a budget of 40,000, excluding producer's fees. This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a  Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including gated reverb to the mix. The master tapes were then sent for final post-production later that month.","output":"The full name of the artist, based on the context provided, is Buddy Holly.

Ash, their colleague or supervisor, has welcomed them back and left a thick stack of paperwork on their desk. This suggests that Cameron will have a busy day at work, as they will likely need to go through all the paperwork, catch up on any missed tasks or communications, and possibly attend to any time-sensitive or important issues indicated in the documents. In the coming days, Cameron might also need to update colleagues on their return, engage in meetings, and collaborate with their team to get back on track with ongoing projects.

Title: Sucker Punch Movie plot: In the 1960s,[9] a young woman[9] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sister's death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers. Babydoll convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines...

What are the things an Indian should do in his/her early 20s? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Task 1: Explain the difference between sampling and population in research Step 1: Define sampling and population - Sampling: The process of selecting a subset of individuals from a larger group, known as the population, to study and make inferences about the entire group. - Population: The entire group of individuals or objects that we want to gather information about and make conclusions from in a research study. Step 2: Explain the purpose of sampling - The purpose of sampling is to draw accurate conclusions about a population without having to study every single individual or object in that population. It enables researchers to save time and resources while still obtaining valuable insights. Step 3: Explain the limitations of sampling - Sampling can result in bias if the sample is not representative of the population. In addition, the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from a sample depends on the sample size and the methods used to select the sample. Step 4: Conclude with the main difference - The primary difference between sampling and population in research is that sampling refers to the selection of a smaller subset of individuals or objects from a larger group, while the population refers to the entire group that the research study is focused on. Task 2: List the things an Indian should do in their early 20s Step 1: Consider the context and importance of early 20s - Early 20s is a crucial period in an individual's life where they transition from adolescence to adulthood. This stage often marks the beginning of personal, educational, and professional development. Step 2: List the things an Indian should do in their early 20s 1. Pursue higher education or skill development programs 2. Develop healthy habits, such as exercising, eating well, and maintaining good mental health 3. Build a strong social network, including friends and professional connections 4. Begin saving money and start investing for financial security 5. Gain work experience through internships, part-time jobs, or volunteer work 6. Explore their passions and interests, and engage in hobbies and leisure activities 7. Travel and learn about different cultures, both within India and abroad 8. Set personal and professional goals and work towards achieving them 9. Develop essential life skills, like communication, time management, and decision-making 10. Focus on self-improvement and personal growth Task 3: Determine if the two questions are paraphrases of each other Step 1: Analyze the content of each question - Question 1: Differences between sampling and population in research - Question 2: Things an Indian should do in their early 20s Step 2: Compare the content and intent of the questions - The content of the questions is different, as the first question deals with research methodologies, while the second is focused on personal development and life goals. - The intent of the questions is also different, as the first question seeks an explanation for a technical concept, while the second asks for advice or suggestions for an individual's early 20s. Step 3: Make a conclusion - Based on the analysis, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different subjects and have distinct purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder - The cleaned blood is returned to the body. A:","output":"The missing first step of the process is: \\"Blood containing waste products and excess substances is pumped from the heart and circulates throughout the body.\\" To provide a detailed and in-depth understanding of the process, here's the amended and elaborated version that includes the missing first step: 1. Blood containing waste products and excess substances, such as water, glucose, and electrolytes, is pumped from the heart and circulates throughout the body. This is necessary as the metabolic activities in various cells and tissues produce waste that needs to be removed in order to maintain a healthy internal environment. 2. Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries. The renal arteries branch off from the abdominal aorta and supply the kidneys with oxygenated blood that contains waste products and excess substances. 3. The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine and are responsible for filtering and eliminating waste products and excess substances from the blood, while maintaining the balance of electrolytes and fluids in the body. 4. The kidneys contain filters called nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidney. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus, which is a cluster of capillaries, and a tubule, through which the filtrate passes. 5. As blood flows through the glomerulus, the filters capture the waste products, excess substances, and some water due to the pressure gradient. These substances are then pushed into the nearby Bowman's capsule and continue down the tubule. 6. In the tubule, various processes occur, including reabsorption of essential nutrients and substances back into the blood, secretion of additional waste products and substances into the filtrate, and water regulation. The final product of this filtration and reabsorption process is the urine. 7. The waste is combined with water to make urine, which proceeds to the collecting ducts and exits the kidneys through the ureters. 8. The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder, where it is temporarily stored until it can be expelled from the body during the process of urination. 9. Meanwhile, the now cleaned blood, free from waste products and excess substances, continues its circulation in the peritubular capillaries and is returned to the body through the renal veins, which merge with the inferior vena cava and eventually reach the heart. This entire process is instrumental in maintaining the overall homeostasis in the human body, ensuring that waste products and excess substances are efficiently removed while keeping vital nutrients and electrolytes in balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Three men rob a millionaire of diamonds aboard an airliner in flight. When Police Superintendent Benting tries to intervene, Jack Drake, another passenger, knocks him out to save him from being shot. The thieves force the pilot to land so they can dump the passengers. However, the men find the diamonds have already been stolen by someone else (Drake).  Drake is a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. He donates the proceeds of his latest robbery to fund the stalled construction of the \\"New Social Institute\\". He even writes a book, \\"Crackerjack\\": The true story of my exploits., which becomes a bestseller. Everybody is reading it, including the people at Scotland Yard and Baroness Von Haltz, and wondering if it is fact or fiction.

The term Belorussia (Russian: Белору́ссия, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, Russia) first rose in the days of the Russian Empire, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled \\"the Tsar of All the Russias\\", as Russia or the Russian Empire was formed by three parts of Russia—the Great, Little, and White. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the term \\"White Russia\\" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term Byelorussia was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, Byelorussia became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.The term Byelorussia (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called Republic of Belarus (Республика Беларусь spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be \\"Belarus\\". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their Belarusian language forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus.Accordingly, the name Byelorussia was replaced by Belarus in English. Likewise, the adjective Belorussian or Byelorussian was replaced by Belarusian in English. Belarusian is closer to the original Belarusian term of bielaruski. Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from Byelorussia to a form of Krivia because of the supposed connection...

Answer:","output":"The nunchucks experience more resistance on a yoga mat than on a wooden floor, which means they will slide slower on the yoga mat. Since friction between two surfaces causes resistance to movement, the material and texture of the surfaces in contact play an important role in determining the amount of resistance faced while sliding. In this case, a yoga mat has a softer, grippier texture compared to a wooden floor, which has a harder and smoother surface.

La obra de Lucas, tanto en su evangelio como en los Hechos de los Apóstoles, representa un recorrido histórico por el camino de la salvación, abarcando desde el nacimiento de Jesucristo hasta la expansión de la Iglesia primitiva bajo el liderazgo de los apóstoles. El libro contiene múltiples enseñanzas, parábolas y acontecimientos que ilustran cómo Dios, a través de Jesucristo, ofrece la salvación al mundo entero. En el Evangelio según Lucas, el autor presenta a Jesucristo como el Mesías prometido, el Salvador del mundo, y pone especial énfasis en la misión universal de la salvación. Lucas narra el nacimiento de Jesús, su ministerio público, sus enseñanzas, milagros, muerte y resurrección, mostrando que él es el enviado de Dios para redimir a la humanidad del pecado y de la muerte. A lo largo del relato, la figura de Jesucristo se erige como un modelo a seguir para todos aquellos que buscan la salvación y el camino hacia Dios. El libro de los Hechos de los Apóstoles, que es considerado la segunda parte de la obra de Lucas, describe la formación de la Iglesia primitiva y la expansión del cristianismo a lo largo del mundo conocido en aquella época. La narración incluye el ascenso de Jesús al cielo, la venida del Espíritu Santo en Pentecostés, el llamado y la labor misionera de los apóstoles, especialmente de Pedro y Pablo, y el crecimiento de las comunidades cristianas. El final abierto en la obra de Lucas es intencional. Su propósito es mostrar que la historia de la salvación no termina con los hechos narrados, sino que sigue siendo una realidad presente y activa en la vida de la Iglesia y de los creyentes. El mensaje central de la obra es que la salvación, ofrecida por Dios a través de Jesucristo, está disponible para todas las personas, sin importar su origen, cultura o condición social. Este final abierto invita a los lectores a participar activamente en la misión evangelizadora y a continuar escribiendo su propia historia de salvación. En resumen, la obra de Lucas en su totalidad es una crónica del camino de la salvación a lo largo de la vida de Jesucristo y la historia de la Iglesia primitiva, y al mismo tiempo, presenta un final abierto que insta a los creyentes a continuar la labor apostólica y a vivir el mensaje de la salvación en sus propias vidas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So first, Mr. Jake Delhomme played catch with Mr. Steve Smith to score a 7-yard touchdown and then a 12-yard touchdown. So that means they went 7 yards, then 12 yards, which is like running across a small room, then a slightly bigger one. So if we add 7 yards and 12 yards, we get 19 yards. Then the Texans made the third touchdown, where Mr. Matt Schaub played a long game of catch with Mr. Andre Johnson and they scored a 31-yard touchdown, like running the length of a swimming pool. So now, if you want to see how much farther the third touchdown was compared to the first two, we subtract the first two touchdowns ( which is 19 yards) from the third one (which is 31 yards). So, 31 minus 19 gives you... let’s count together, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. That’s 12!  So, the third touchdown was 12 yards more than the total of the first two touchdowns. Like running across a little bit bigger room."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Q: What is the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I?  A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. Answer:","output":"To answer the question, I will first identify the relevant information within the paragraph: - \\"his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I\\" The question asks for the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I. The woman married to Maximilian I is Mary of Burgundy. The paragraph mentions the Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife. So, the grandfather of Mary of Burgundy must be Philip. Answer: Philip the Good"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Any formal recognition of an Anthropocene epoch in the geological time scale hinges on whether humans have changed the Earth system sufficiently to produce a stratigraphic signature in sediments and ice that is distinct from that of the Holocene epoch. Proposals for marking the start of the Anthropocene include an “early Anthropocene” beginning with the spread of agriculture and deforestation; the Columbian Exchange of Old World and New World species; the Industrial Revolution at ~1800 CE; and the mid-20th century “Great Acceleration” of population growth and industrialization.      ADVANCES      Recent anthropogenic deposits contain new minerals and rock types, reflecting rapid global dissemination of novel materials including elemental aluminum, concrete, and plastics that form abundant, rapidly evolving “technofossils.” Fossil fuel combustion has disseminated black carbon, inorganic ash spheres, and spherical carbonaceous particles worldwide, with a near-synchronous global increase around 1950. Anthropogenic sedimentary fluxes have intensified, including enhanced erosion caused by deforestation and road construction. Widespread sediment retention behind dams has amplified delta subsidence.      Geochemical signatures include elevated levels of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticide residues, as well as increased 207/206Pb ratios from leaded gasoline, starting between ~1945 and 1950. Soil nitrogen and phosphorus inventories have doubled in the past century because of increased fertilizer use, generating widespread signatures in lake strata and nitrate levels in Greenland ice that are higher than at any time during the previous 100,000 years.      Detonation of the Trinity atomic device at Alamogordo, New Mexico, on 16 July 1945 initiated local nuclear fallout from 1945 to 1951, whereas thermonuclear weapons tests generated a clear global signal from 1952 to 1980, the so-called “bomb spike” of excess 14C, 239Pu, and other artificial radionuclides that peaks in 1964.      Atmospheric CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations depart from Holocene and even Quaternary patterns starting at ~1850, and more markedly at ~1950, with an associated steep fall in δ13C that is captured by tree rings and calcareous fossils. An average global temperature increase of 0.6o to 0.9oC from 1900 to the present, occurring predominantly in the past 50 years, is now rising beyond the Holocene variation of the past 14,000 years, accompanied by a modest enrichment of δ18O in Greenland ice starting at ~1900. Global sea levels increased at 3.2 ± 0.4 mm/year from 1993 to 2010 and are now rising above Late Holocene rates. Depending on the trajectory of future anthropogenic forcing, these trends may reach or exceed the envelope of Quaternary interglacial conditions.      Biologic changes also have been pronounced. Extinction rates have been far above background rates since 1500 and increased further in the 19th century and later; in addition, species assemblages have been altered worldwide by geologically unprecedented transglobal species invasions and changes associated with farming and fishing, permanently reconfiguring Earth’s biological trajectory. ||||| We're living through one of the most extraordinary events in Earth's history — the start of a new geological epoch, an international group of scientists says.      Welcome to the Anthropocene, everyone.      Geological epochs are long periods of time — typically lasting around two million years — separated by major, global changes to the planet, such as the massive exploding meteor that ended the Late Cretaceous and wiped out the dinosaurs.      They've left a permanent record in our sediments and our soils and our glacial ice that's going to be detectable for millennia. - Colin Waters, Anthropocene Working Group      Modern humans arose during the Pleistocene epoch, and since the sudden warming that ended the last ice age about 12,000 years ago, we had been living in the Holocene epoch.      But modern human technology has had such a profound effect on our planet that we're now in a new epoch that started during the mid-20th century — the Anthropocene, argues an international group of researchers in a new paper published today in the journal Science.      University of Alberta researcher Alexander Wolfe studies the remains of lake microorganisms in layers of sediments deposited over decades and centuries, and says he has personally observed enormous changes marking the past 50 years. (University of Alberta)      The boundary between two epochs is visible to geologists as some kind of \\"marker\\" between layers of rock, soil or ice that are deposited all over the Earth over time. For example, the Late Cretaceous-ending meteor left a distinct layer of iridium.      In the case of the Anthropocene, scientists note that humans have produced unusual materials like radioactive fallout from nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s.      \\"They've left a permanent record in our sediments and our soils and our glacial ice that's going to be detectable for millennia,\\" said Colin Waters, a geologist with the British Geological Survey and secretary of the Anthropocene Working Group, whose members authored the new report.      \\"Geologists in millions of years time will look back at and say, 'Something quite incredible happened at this time' and be quite precise about when it happened.\\"      In their paper, the researchers added, \\"Not only would this represent the first instance of a new epoch having been witnessed firsthand by advanced human societies, it would be one stemming from the consequences of their own doing.\\"      Concrete is among the unusual materials - and a type of rock - that humans have spread all over the Earth in a distinct layer. A wide range of such materials is listed in the new paper. (John Woo/Reuters)      Nobel Prize-winning scientist Paul Crutzen first proposed in 2002 that a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene be assigned to the present to describe the profound changes that humans have made to the planet.      That eventually led the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the scientific body that officially decides when epochs begin and end, to ask a group of geologists, paleontologists and other scientists to look into whether there was enough science to back up that proposal. The Anthropocene Working Group has been working on the question since 2009.      Many markers      In the new paper summarizing their findings, they list a large number of \\"markers\\" that humans have left in rock, soil and ice around the world. In addition to the radioactive fallout, they make a note of:      Pottery      Glass      Bricks      Concrete      Copper alloys      Elemental aluminum (only found as an ore in nature).      Plastics      Black carbon and other particles from fossil fuel combustion.      High levels of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers and pesticides.      The start of new epochs is often accompanied by climate change and mass extinctions, both of which humans are causing now.      \\"Humans now control several of the fundamental dials or knobs on the planetary system,\\" said Alexander Wolfe, an adjunct professor of paelobiology at the University of Alberta who is a member of the working group and a co-author of the paper.      Wolfe studies the remains of lake microorganisms in sediments deposited over decades and centuries, and says he has personally observed enormous changes marking the past 50 years.      Making new rocks      Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the group has faced some criticism from people who feel the Earth hasn't had enough time to make enough rock to really define a new geological epoch.      \\"The reality is we've done some calculations and there's the equivalent of one kilogram of concrete produced by humans for every square metre of the planet,\\" he said.      Plastics are also among man-made materials that will be found in ice and sediments from the past 50 years. (CP)      The new epoch isn't official yet. The Anthropocene Working Group still needs to:      Decide exactly when the Anthropocene began.      Decide what formal marker they'll use to define it and then choose a location in which to drive a \\"golden spike\\" into the rock at that marker at a place on Earth where the marker is very distinct.      Formally present its arguments to the International Commission of Stratigraphy and have them accepted.      For now, the group suggests making the start 1950 — when humans started having a really major effect on the planet — and the marker of nuclear fallout from Cold War nuclear tests.      \\"It's an absolutely bomber marker that fits right in the middle of this transition,\\" Wolfe said. ||||| New study provides one of the strongest cases yet that the planet has entered a new geological epoch      There is now compelling evidence to show that humanity’s impact on the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans and wildlife has pushed the world into a new geological epoch, according to a group of scientists.      The question of whether humans’ combined environmental impact has tipped the planet into an “Anthropocene” – ending the current Holocene which began around 12,000 years ago – will be put to the geological body that formally approves such time divisions later this year.      The new study provides one of the strongest cases yet that from the amount of concrete mankind uses in building to the amount of plastic rubbish dumped in the oceans, Earth has entered a new geological epoch.      “We could be looking here at a stepchange from one world to another that justifies being called an epoch,” said Dr Colin Waters, principal geologist at the British Geological Survey and an author on the study published in Science on Thursday.      “What this paper does is to say the changes are as big as those that happened at the end of the last ice age. This is a big deal.”      He said that the scale and rate of change on measures such as CO2 and methane concentrations in the atmosphere were much larger and faster than the changes that defined the start of the holocene.      Humans have introduced entirely novel changes, geologically speaking, such as the roughly 300m metric tonnes of plastic produced annually. Concrete has become so prevalent in construction that more than half of all the concrete ever used was produced in the past 20 years.      Wildlife, meanwhile, is being pushed into an ever smaller area of the Earth, with just 25% of ice-free land considered wild now compared to 50% three centuries ago. As a result, rates of extinction of species are far above long-term averages.      But the study says perhaps the clearest fingerprint humans have left, in geological terms, is the presence of isotopes from nuclear weapons testing that took place in the 1950s and 60s.            Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tower blocks in Hong Kong. More than half of all the concrete ever used was produced in the past 20 years. Photograph: Bobby Yip/Reuters      “Potentially the most widespread and globally synchronous Anthropogenic signal is the fallout from nuclear weapons testing,” the paper says.      “It’s probably a good candidate [for a single line of evidence to justify a new epoch] ... we can recognise it in glacial ice, so if an ice core was taken from Greenland, we could say that’s where it [the start of the Anthropocene] was defined,” Waters said.      The study says that accelerating technological change, and a growth in population and consumption have driven the move into the Anthropocene, which advocates of the concept suggest started around the middle of the 20th century.            “We are becoming a major geological force, and that’s something that really has happened since we had that technological advance after the second world war. Before that it was horse and cart transporting stuff around the planet, it was low key, nothing was happening particularly dramatically,” said Waters.      He added that the study should not be taken as “conclusive statement” that the Anthropocene had arrived, but as “another level of information” for the debate on whether it should be formally declared an epoch by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS).      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Istopes common in nature, 14C, and a naturally rare isotope, 293Pu, are present through the Earth’s mid-latitudes due to nuclear testing in the 1950s and 60s. Photograph: Associated Press      Waters said that if the ICS was to formally vote in favour of making the Anthropocene an official epoch, its significance to the wider world would be in conveying the scale of what humanity is doing to the Earth.      “We [the public] are well aware of the climate discussions that are going on. That’s one aspect of the changes happening to the entire planet. What this paper does, and the Anthropocene concept, is say that’s part of a whole set of changes to not just the atmosphere, but the oceans, the ice – the glaciers that we’re using for this project might not be here in 10,000 years.      “People are environmentally aware these days but maybe the information is not available to them to show the scale of changes that are happening.”      The international team behind the paper includes several other members of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy’s Anthropocene working group, which hopes to present a proposal to the ICS later this year. The upswing in usage of the Anthropocene term is credited to Paul Crutzen, the Dutch Nobel prize-winning atmospheric chemist, after he wrote about it in 2000.      Key markers of change that are indicative of the Anthropocene. A shows new markers, while B shows long-ranging signals. Photograph: sciencemag.org      Prof Phil Gibbard, a geologist at the University of Cambridge who initially set up the working group examining formalising the Anthropocene, said that while he respected the work of Waters and others on the subject, he questioned how useful it would be to declare a new epoch.      “It’s really rather too near the present day for us to be really getting our teeth into this one. That’s not to say I or any of my colleagues are climate change deniers or anything of that kind, we fully recognise the points: the data and science is there.      “What we question is the philosophy, and usefulness. It’s like having a spanner but no use for it,” he said.      Gibbard suggested it might be better if the Anthropocene was seen as a cultural term – such as as the Neolithic era, the end of the stone age – rather than a geological one.      Evidence we’ve started an ‘Anthropocene’      We’ve pushed extinction rates of flora and fauna far above the long-term average. The Earth is now on course for a sixth mass extinction which would see 75% of species extinct in the next few centuries if current trends continue      Increased the concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 120 parts per million since the industrial revolution because of fossil fuel-burning, leaving concentrations today at around 400ppm and rising      Nuclear weapon tests in the 1950s and 60s left traces of an isotope common in nature, 14C, and a naturally rare isotope, 293Pu, through the Earth’s mid-latitudes      Put so much plastic in our waterways and oceans that microplastic particles are now virtually ubiquitous, and plastics will likely leave identifiable fossil records for future generations to discover      Doubled the nitrogen and phosphorous in our soils in the past century with our fertiliser use. According to some research, we’ve had the largest impact on the nitrogen cycle in 2.5bn years |||||Summary:","output":"Scientists have concluded that Earth has entered a new geological epoch, called the Anthropocene, beginning in the mid-20th century. This is due to factors such as prevelant manmade materials like concrete and plastic, markers like radioactive fallout from nuclear tests, and high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil from fertilizer and pesticide use. More than half of all the concrete ever used was produced in just the past 20 years, and rates of extinction of species are extremely high.

Fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days. As has already been pointed out, this is hardly a real zombie film, but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers.

The humor is not in-your-face, but rather subdued; there's a lot of attention to detail and I caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie.

Matthew Fontaine Maury (January 14, 1806 - February 1, 1873) was an American astronomer, United States Navy officer, historian, oceanographer, meteorologist, cartographer, author, geologist, and educator. He was nicknamed \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" and \\"Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology\\" and later, \\"Scientist of the Seas\\" for his extensive works in his books, especially The Physical Geography of the Sea (1855), the first such extensive and comprehensive book on oceanography to be published. Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and ocean currents, including ocean lanes for passing ships at sea. Maury was a descendant of the Maury family, a prominent Virginia family of Huguenot ancestry that can be traced back to 15th-century France. His grandfather (the Reverend James Maury) was an inspiring teacher to a future US president, Thomas Jefferson. Maury also had Dutch-American ancestry from the \\"Minor\\" family of early Virginia.  He was born in 1806 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg; his parents were Richard Maury and Diane Minor Maury. The family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, when he was five. He wanted to emulate the naval career of his older brother, Flag Lieutenant John Minor Maury, who, however, caught yellow fever after fighting pirates as an officer in the US Navy. As a result of John's painful death, Matthew's father, Richard, forbade him from joining the Navy. Maury strongly considered attending West Point to get a better education than the Navy could offer at that time, but instead, he obtained a naval appointment through the influence of Tennessee Representative Sam Houston, a family friend, in 1825, at the age of 19.  Maury joined the Navy as a midshipman on board the frigate Brandywine which was carrying the Marquis de La Fayette home to France, following La Fayette's famous visit to the United States. Almost immediately, Maury began to study the seas and to record methods of navigation. One of the experiences that piqued this interest was a circumnavigation of the globe on the USS Vincennes, his assigned ship and the first US warship to travel around the world.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone.

Hill farm grown coffee conventionally, while Valley farm is into shade-grown coffee production.  Which farm had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies?  Hint: With shade applications, crops are purposely raised under tree canopies within the shady environment. The understory crops are shade tolerant or the overstory trees have fairly open canopies. A conspicuous example is shade-grown coffee. This practice reduces weeding costs and improves coffee quality and taste. The shade does not necessarily translate into lost or reduced yields. This is because the rate of photosynthesis hardly increases once the light intensity is over about one tenth that of direct overhead sunlight and declines with increasing light intensity. This means that shaded plants can grow well. Planting more than one level of vegetation can increase total photosynthesis and overall yields.","output":"Valley farm, which is into shade-grown coffee production, had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame.

Hypothesis: The fathers are chatting as the kids play. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis. The premise provides limited information about the situation: we know that two men are talking and that four kids run by. The provided hypothesis attempts to give context to the situation, suggesting that the men are fathers to the children and that the children are playing. However, the premise does not offer sufficient evidence to support this hypothesis conclusively. Several points should be addressed to clarify if we can conclude the hypothesis from the premise: 1. Relationship between the men and the children: The premise does not indicate whether the children playing nearby are related to the men talking. It is possible that they are the kids' fathers, as hypothesized, but it is also possible that they are not related at all. The children may be part of another group or simply playing together in a public space while the men engage in a separate conversation. 2. Context and location: The premise lacks details about the setting of the event. Are they at a park, a school, or a gathering of families? Understanding where the scenario takes place would help to determine if it could be reasonably inferred that the men are fathers and that they are talking as kids play. 3. Interaction between the men and the children: If there is some interaction between the men and the children, it could provide stronger evidence to support the hypothesis. For instance, if the kids are continuously addressing the men as their fathers or if the men are supervising the children's activities, it would be easier to conclude that the hypothesis could be true. 4. Content of conversation: The conversation topic between the men could also indicate their relationship with the children. If they discuss their kids' activities, parenting experiences, or other familial matters, it may lend credibility to the hypothesis. However, this information is not provided in the given premise. In conclusion, while the hypothesis may be plausible given the limited details outlined in the premise, we cannot conclusively accept or reject the hypothesis. The connection between the men's conversation and the children's activities is not explicitly established, and no additional contextual information is provided to support these assumptions. To determine the validity of the hypothesis, further information about the relationships between the men and the children, the location, and the conversation's content would be required."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Movie title: The Exorcist III Context: The film begins with the point of view of someone wandering through the streets of Georgetown, a voice informing us \\"I have dreams... of a rose... and of falling down a long flight of stairs.\\" The point of view shows a warning of evil about to arrive later that night at a church. Demonic growls are heard. Leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered. Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer, out to see their mutually favorite film It's a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes placeâa priest is found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalizedâand found murdered the next dayâwith the words \\"IT'S A WONDERFULL LIFE\\" [sic] written on a wall in Dyer's blood. The fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease: fifteen years ago the vicious serial killer James \\"The Gemini\\" Venamun, was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the Zodiac sign of Gemini into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini's sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra \\"L\\" in his notes sent to the media, such as \\"usefull\\" or \\"carefull\\". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer's true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police's homicide department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the left middle finger was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved on the back of the victim.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.  answer the following question:  What recording did Gramophone magazine vote the greatest recording of all time in 1999?

For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.  Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library.

Please answer the following question: There is a local election in Troy's city and he is researching the two candidates running for mayor. Troy is a strong environmentalist who believes, above all else, that taking care of the Earth is the number one priority in anything. In his research he decides to read the environmental proposals of each candidate. Mark Hampton, one candidate, has a proposal that he says will strongly boost the city's economy by opening more industrial factories, but these will increase the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere. Jeffrey Lindell, the other candidate, says that he wants to begin implementing solar panel farms to generate electricity to cut down on the carbon emissions the city produces.  Which candidate is Troy less likely to vote for?  Hint: Current Situation : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about . Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future). Answer:","output":"Given Troy's strong environmentalist beliefs and his focus on taking care of the Earth as a top priority, it is important to analyze both candidates' proposals in the context of their potential impact on the environment. Step 1: Consider Mark Hampton's proposal Mark Hampton's proposal involves opening more industrial factories, which will boost the city's economy. However, it will also result in an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. This is not favorable for an environmentalist like Troy, as it contributes to the greenhouse effect and exacerbates the issue of climate change. Step 2: Consider Jeffrey Lindell's proposal Jeffrey Lindell's proposal is to implement solar panel farms to generate electricity. By doing this, the city would cut down on its carbon emissions, thus having a positive impact on the environment. This aligns more with Troy's environmentalist beliefs. Step 3: Compare the proposals When comparing both proposals, it is clear that Mark Hampton's plan could have negative consequences on the environment due to the increase in carbon dioxide emissions, while Jeffrey Lindell's plan is more environmentally friendly by promoting clean energy and reducing emissions. Based on the information provided, Troy is less likely to vote for Mark Hampton, as his proposal to open more industrial factories would increase carbon dioxide emissions, which goes against Troy's strong environmental beliefs."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The story should expand upon the given facts to create a broader, coherent narrative. Story: Once upon a time in the small town of Rio County, the legendary Sheriff Buddy Deeds was remembered for his unwavering fairness and justice. Under his rule, the townspeople lived in peace and harmony, knowing that they could rely on him to keep them safe. Sam, the son of Buddy's wife, grew up idolizing his father's dedication to justice. Even years after Buddy's passing, the people of Rio County still held him in high regard. As a result, people started developing plans to pay homage to his legacy. One day, business leader Mercedes Cruz and Buddy's former deputy announced their efforts to enlarge and rename the local courthouse in Buddy's honor. However, Sam wasn't thrilled by this proposal and disapproved of their decision. He believed that the move was driven more by personal interests and politics, rather than a genuine admiration of Buddy's work and impact on the community. Meanwhile, in another part of town, Colonel Delmore Payne arrived as the new commander of the local U.S. Army base. His military presence added to the growing concerns and changing dynamics of the town. The townspeople wondered if the arrival of Colonel Payne would bring a new level of order and authority to the area, as they still longed for the days of Sheriff Buddy Deeds. Not long after Colonel Payne's arrival, a group of relic hunters made a shocking discovery on an old shooting range, unearthing a human skeleton along with a Masonic ring, Rio County sheriff's badge, and a bullet that was not used by the military. The news of the find spread quickly throughout the town, and the mysterious items raised many questions about the past and the truth behind the legend of Buddy Deeds. Sam recalled stories from his youth about Buddy's wild younger days. His mother told him that Buddy once had a mistress before settling down and becoming a deputy sheriff. The revelation seemed to clash with the image of the fair and just man the town held so dear. Did the uncovered skeleton belong to someone from Buddy's past, or was it just a random coincidence? Sam decided to delve further into the mystery, hoping to uncover the truth about his father's past. As he dug deeper, he discovered that the Masonic ring belonged to an influential figure who could have posed a threat to Buddy's position as the sheriff. Could this have been the reason for Buddy's sudden change in behavior and devotion to the life of a lawman? While Colonel Payne continued to settle into his new position in town, Mercedes Cruz and Buddy's former deputy pressed on with their plans for the courthouse. Despite Sam's disapproval, they managed to gain support from the community, citing the need to honor Buddy's contributions to Rio County. Sam felt conflicted, struggling between his desire to preserve his father's true image and revelations that seemed to challenge the idea of the perfect Sheriff Buddy Deeds. In the end, Sam discovered that the human skeleton on the old shooting range belonged to a man involved in illegal activities that Buddy had tried to stop when he was a deputy sheriff. The bullet was not from the military; it was a remnant of a dangerous confrontation that ultimately changed Buddy's life. The story behind the skeleton revealed that Buddy had been shaped by both his wildness and his dedication to justice, making him the man that the town would remember forever. With newfound respect for his father's journey, Sam approved of the efforts to enlarge and rename the courthouse, participating actively in ensuring it was a fitting tribute to his father's memory. And so, the courthouse became a symbol of Sheriff Buddy Deeds' legacy, with Colonel Delmore Payne looking over the town that continued to evolve, and Sam holding onto the truths he had uncovered. Rio County would forever remember Buddy Deeds as a fair and just lawman while acknowledging the untold stories that shaped his legend."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Short general knowledge question: who is the voice of stewie griffin from family guy?

The recent fighting in Iraq has posed a serious challenge to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his government, raising questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that the United States will help the Iraqi government in the battle against al Qaeda-linked fighters in western Iraq, but he stressed it won't send troops. Here are five questions about the deteriorating situation: 1. I thought the Iraq war was over. Why is there still fighting? Well, actually last year was the deadliest since 2008. The number of dead reached its worst levels since the height of the Iraq war, when sectarian fighting between the country's Shiite majority and its Sunni minority pushed it to the brink of civil war. Those tensions continue to be fueled by widespread discontent among the Sunnis, who say they are marginalized by the Shiite-led government and unfairly targeted by heavy-handed security tactics.","output":"As the fighting in Iraq continues, the situation worsens and poses a serious challenge to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his government. The U.S. offers support but refuses to send troops. Tensions between the Shiite majority and Sunni minority escalate, leading to increased violence throughout the country. In an effort to address these issues and prevent a full-blown civil war, diplomatic efforts are stepped up by the international community. The United Nations, alongside regional powers such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, work together to mediate negotiations between the warring factions. These peace talks initially struggle as each side remains firm in their positions, but gradually concessions are made, and a fragile peace is established. Under international pressure, the Iraqi government agrees to a power-sharing deal where both Sunni and Shiite factions are fairly represented. This is a difficult process, as both sides remain skeptical of each other given their history of conflict. However, with the guidance and encouragement of the UN and the support of influential regional powers, a tentative agreement is eventually reached. The implementation of this power-sharing deal initially faces challenges as distrust and lingering animosity exists between the factions. The situation remains precarious, and sporadic episodes of violence still occur. Yet, with time and the continuous support from the international community, both sides begin to see the benefits of stability and cooperation. As years pass, the power-sharing deal continues to function, and a stronger, more inclusive government emerges. This fosters a sense of unity among the Iraqi people that, albeit slowly, begins to heal the divisions between Shiites and Sunnis. Progress is made in rebuilding the infrastructure destroyed by years of conflict, allowing the economy to grow, and the quality of life for citizens improves. Although challenges still persist, and setbacks occur from time to time, the story ends on a hopeful note. The continuing efforts of the people of Iraq, their government, and the support from the international community signify the importance of dialogue and cooperation in healing the wounds of the past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make a list of the tasks to be completed, the dates they need to be finished, and how long each task should take. Use this information to create a rough timeline for you to adhere to while you work. Hypothesis:  Creating and timeline benefits everybody in the world","output":"Hypothesis: Creating and adhering to a timeline provides numerous benefits that could potentially be advantageous for individuals across the world. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, let us first delve into the reasons why creating a timeline can be beneficial, and then discuss how these advantages might extend to people across the globe. 1. Improved Time Management: Creating a timeline enables individuals to better manage their time by defining tasks, deadlines, and the projected duration of each task. This allows for improved organization, which can lead to increased productivity, as individuals can allocate their time correctly and maximize their efficiency. 2. Clearer Goals and Objectives: Developing a timeline helps individuals set and define specific goals and objectives for their projects or tasks. By providing a clear roadmap of what needs to be done, and when, it allows people to focus on each step of the process, making it easier to complete tasks and achieve desired outcomes. 3. Enhanced Motivation and Commitment: When people have a timeline in place, it provides a sense of accountability and motivates them to stay on track. This can help encourage individuals to push through challenging tasks and maintain their dedication to a project, increasing the likelihood of successful completion. 4. Better Communication and Collaboration: In group projects or team-based situations, a well-established timeline can facilitate communication and collaboration among team members. Timelines provide clear expectations for each individual's responsibilities and deadlines, enabling smoother cooperation and coordination to achieve common goals. 5. Monitoring Progress: A timeline allows individuals to track their progress as they complete tasks, enabling them to identify potential issues or areas for improvement early on. By consistently monitoring progress, people can make adjustments as needed, allowing for greater adaptability and ultimately a higher rate of success. Now, considering the benefits that timelines offer, it is reasonable to argue that these advantages might extend to people across the globe. The use of timelines transcends cultural, geographical, and occupational boundaries, providing a universally applicable tool for improving efficiency and productivity. However, it is important to recognize that the effectiveness of timelines as a universally beneficial tool is contingent upon individuals' ability to correctly apply the timeline creation process and follow through on their commitments. Additionally, individuals might have different preferences or work styles, and some may not find a strict timeline as useful as others. However, on the whole, creating and adhering to a timeline does appear to provide significant benefits that could effectively improve the lives and work of individuals worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  I am facing a new situation today: Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The human body has hundreds of muscles. The three types are skeletal  muscles, smooth muscles and cardiac, or heart muscles. Each kind of muscle has a special job to do. The skeletal muscles are attached to the bones; they actually hold the skeleton together. Strong cords, called tendons , help connect these muscles to the bones. Skeletal muscles give us strength and allow us to move in many ways. If you look at skeletal muscles through a microscope, you will see that it has bands of fibers that look like stripes . These stripes are called striations. Skeletal muscles usually move because the brain has sent a conscious message to them telling them what to do. This is called voluntary movement. Another type of muscle is smooth muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not have striations. This is found in organs such as the stomach, the bladder , the lungs and the eyes. Smooth muscles are smaller than the skeletal muscles and they move involuntarily. The brain tells these muscles what to do, but we aren't even aware of it. For example, we don't have to think about breathing or digesting food. The smooth muscles just do their jobs automatically. For this reason smooth muscles are sometimes called involuntary muscles. Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle also works involuntarily. It is a very thick muscle that is found only in the walls of the heart. Its job is to pump blood out of the heart and into blood vessels called arteries . The arteries help carry the blood to all parts of the body. When the cardiac muscles relax, they let blood back into the heart. Cardiac muscles have striations, just like skeletal muscles do. Options: A Heart muscles are very important because they give us strength and allow us to move. B The heart of human beings completely consists of heart muscle.

Sentence 1: \\"We can stumble into a war with China over Taiwan very easily, warns Professor David Shambaugh of George Washington University.\\" This sentence focuses on the ease with which a war with China over Taiwan could occur according to Professor David Shambaugh. It highlights that the situation is potentially volatile and that a conflict could arise without much effort or intention. Sentence 2: \\"Shambaugh is concerned that we will accidentally get into an unintended war with China.\\" This sentence brings attention to the specific concern of Professor David Shambaugh that the war with China would be unintended and accidental, making the situation even more worrisome. The focus is on the lack of intentionality behind the potential conflict. Both sentences convey the same idea - that there is a high likelihood of an unintended or accidental war with China over Taiwan, as warned by Professor David Shambaugh. The difference lies in their presentation and emphasis. Sentence 1 stresses the ease of stumbling into a conflict, while Sentence 2 focuses on the accidental nature of the situation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"How do genes encode multiple proteins?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short sections across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"How do genes encode multiple proteins?\\" However, it would be more helpful to provide a more detailed and elaborate explanation to improve the understanding of the reader.  As the sentence suggests, there are two primary mechanisms through which a single gene can encode multiple proteins: 1. Alternative Splicing: In eukaryotic organisms, genes consist of coding regions called exons and non-coding regions called introns. The process of transcription in eukaryotes involves the initial creation of a precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) molecule, which contains these exons and introns. Before the mature mRNA molecule is translated into a protein, the introns must be removed, and the exons must be joined together in a process called splicing. Alternative splicing is a regulated process that involves the selective joining of different exons and/or the removal of specific introns. This process can generate multiple mRNA variants from a single pre-mRNA molecule, and each variant can be translated into a unique protein isoform. Consequently, the final protein products may exhibit distinct structural and functional properties, allowing the gene to participate in diverse cellular processes. Alternative splicing is a common feature of eukaryotic genomes and can greatly expand the coding capacity of the genome by producing multiple proteins from a single gene. 2. Trans-splicing: In some organisms, particularly in lower eukaryotes and certain specialized cells of higher eukaryotes, another mechanism exists through which a single gene can generate multiple proteins. This process, known as trans-splicing, involves the joining of exons from separate RNA molecules that are transcribed from different genomic locations. In trans-splicing, two or more precursor mRNA molecules are cleaved at specific sites, mainly in their intron regions, and then joined together in a new arrangement. The resulting concatenated mRNA molecules can be translated into different proteins, depending on which exons and coding sequences are included within each spliced mRNA. This process allows for the generation of various protein isoforms encoded by separate, discontinuous coding sequences present across the genome. In summary, the sentence provided a valid answer to the question by identifying alternative splicing and trans-splicing as primary mechanisms through which a single gene can encode multiple proteins. However, a more detailed explanation enriches the reader's understanding of the processes involved in the generation of multiple proteins from a single gene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \\"try and stay away\\" from the Justice Department, but \\"at some point, I... Why was Trump critical of the FBI?

If \\"A baseball outfielder is leaping against the fence as he watches the ball sail over it.\\", does this mean that \\"A person is playing baseball.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"A baseball outfielder is leaping against the fence as he watches the ball sail over it\\" necessitates that a person is playing baseball. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation, let's break down the key components of the statement. Firstly, a \\"baseball outfielder\\" refers to a player who is positioned in the outfield, which is the area of the baseball field beyond the infield. The outfield is typically divided into three sections: left field, center field, and right field. An outfielder's primary responsibility is to catch or retrieve balls that may come their way as a result of another player hitting the ball. By position definition, an outfielder is a baseball player and, as such, a person playing baseball. Secondly, let's analyze the action taking place. The outfielder is \\"leaping against the fence,\\" which implies that the player is attempting to make a play on a ball that is approaching the fence or boundary of the field. Generally, outfielders leap against fences to try to catch a ball that would otherwise result in a home run for the opposing team. The act of leaping against the fence in pursuit of the ball is a physical action that demonstrates the player's engagement in the game, reinforcing the idea that the person is indeed playing baseball. Lastly, the statement mentions that the outfielder is \\"watching the ball sail over it.\\" This provides further context about the situation unfolding: a ball has been hit by a player with enough power and trajectory to propel it over the fence. The hit, likely a home run, is also an integral part of a baseball game, strengthening the notion that a person is playing baseball. In summary, the statement \\"A baseball outfielder is leaping against the fence as he watches the ball sail over it\\" undoubtedly conveys that a person is playing baseball. By analyzing the position of the outfielder, the actions depicted, and the presence of a hit ball sailing over the fence, we can confirm that the situation presents itself within a baseball game, involving at least two people engaged in the sport, one of whom is the outfielder in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yamato Tanooka was found alive and well in a military hut on Friday morning, almost a week after his parents ordered him out of the car as punishment for throwing stones during a family trip to the forest in Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island.      He had spent six nights in the hut, and survived by drinking water from a tap outside and sleeping in between two mattresses to keep warm. Yamato, who was not seriously hurt, is expected to be discharged from hospital on Tuesday.      His parents, meanwhile, face possible legal action over suspected psychological abuse, Japanese media reported. His father, Takayuki Tanooka, said he had again apologised to his son for his actions, which attracted widespread criticism on social media.      “I said to him, ‘Dad made you go though such a hard time. I am sorry’,” Tanooka, 44, said in an interview with the TBS network that was broadcast on Monday. “And then, my son said, ‘You are a good dad. I forgive you’,” Tanooka added, struggling to hold back tears.      The Sankei Shimbun quoted Yamato as saying: “I was wrong, because I didn’t listen to what my dad was saying.”      Yamato tried to chase after his parents and sister immediately after being abandoned in the forest on the evening of 28 May, it has emerged. Upset, he lost his sense of direction and started walking away from his parents’ car, the Mainichi Shimbun said.            His ordeal ended when three soldiers, seeking shelter from the rain, opened the door to a military hut to find him curled up on a mattress. It has also emerged that police are considering legal action against Yamato’s parents for possible psychological abuse.      Police in Hokkaido have submitted written notification about possible abuse to a child welfare centre in the nearby city of Hakodate, the Asahi Shimbun said.      His parents faced an avalanche of online criticism for their actions, although some sympathised with their predicament. Tanooka said he had already grown angry with his son because he had been in trouble at school for hitting cars with a stick.      “So I tried to show him that I can be scary when I’m seriously angry,” he said, citing what he described as a “father’s dignity”.      The Kyodo news agency quoted sources familiar with the case as saying that Tanooka had cried so much after his parents left him at the side of the road in a bear-inhabited area of the forest that he lost his sense of direction.            The extraordinary survival of the boy left in a Japanese forest Read more      Dressed in a tracksuit, T-shirt and trainers, he set off in the opposite direction in which his parents’ car had been travelling, before coming across an unpaved road that eventually took him to the military hut about 6km away.      Yamato reportedly saw no one during the time he spent inside the unheated hut. By the time he was found, he was suffering from mild dehydration and had lost 2kg (4.5lbs), according to Japanese media.      He reportedly told his father that he couldn’t remember how he had got to the hut, but said he had managed to overcome his fear of being alone and get some sleep.      More details have emerged of the obstacles he would have encountered on his journey to the hut, which, he did not realise at the time, was just a mile away from a private house.      Walking along the narrow mountain roads would have extended the distance he covered to about six miles, the Mainichi Shimbun quoted a self-defence force (SDF) soldier as saying. “They are mountain roads that go up and down ... even a member of the SDF would take about two and half hours to get to the military exercise area.”      His route, in pitch darkness, would have taken him through a maze of interconnected and unpaved roads lined by thick bushes and tall trees, making it impossible for him to get his bearings.      “He probably avoided side roads and chose the wider roads, leading him to the facility where he was found,” the SDF member added.      Yamato Tanooka’s story has exposed the perils of parenting | Deborah Orr Read more      Yamato reportedly said he had tried to turn on the lights inside the hut, but found there was no power supply. Emergency services, meanwhile, defended the scope of their search, which after six days had uncovered no clues as to his whereabouts.      Police said they had expanded the search to include Mount Komagatake after Yamato’s sister said she had seen him walk off in that direction, but had not checked the nearby military training area. “We searched places where we thought a child would be likely to go,” Kyodo quoted a senior police officer as saying.      The search, involving up to 180 people, had initially covered a radius of two miles from the spot where Yamato was told to get out of the car, but was later expanded to a 10-mile radius.            “Considering the physical strength and mindset of a child, we didn’t think he would head to the mountaintops or off the main road,” a firefighter told Kyodo.      There is still no satisfactory explanation for why Yamato was not discovered when soldiers on a regular patrol checked the hut last Monday morning but found nothing out of the ordinary. ||||| Yamato Tanooka, the 7-year-old boy found Friday in a hut at a Self-Defense Forces training facility in southwest Hokkaido six days after he went missing, has said that he lost his sense of direction because he cried so much after his father ordered him to get out of the car. He apparently headed in the opposite direction of the car, sources familiar with the case said Sunday.      Because he was scared of the mountains, he continued to walk along the road until he reached the SDF training facility where he was later found. The door was unlocked so he went inside to sleep and avoid the cold outside, he was quoted as telling his father and others.      Tanooka told his father he did not see anyone during the six days he was missing. According to other sources, the boy said he stayed at the shelter because he thought someone would eventually find him.      After six days of drinking only water and eating no food, his lost 2 kg, Before his ordeal, he weighed 22 kg, sources said.      Also on Sunday, police said they notified the Hakodate child consultation center about the incident on Friday as the boy may have been psychologically abused.      The latest case also showed how hard it is to predict the actions of children, experts say.      “We searched for places where children would likely go,” said a senior police officer at Central Hakodate Police Station, which has jurisdiction over the town of Nanae where Yamato Tanooka went missing on May 28.      Tanooka was found inside a shelter where SDF officers taking part in exercises stay overnight. There is a tap outside with running water, but no food. SDF officers who happened to drop by before taking part in Friday’s drill discovered the boy inside the hut. If they had not found him, it could have cost Tanooka his life.      Rescuers initially searched an area with a radius of 3 km from the spot where his parents told him to get out of the car as punishment. They eventually widened the radius to 15 km, but went in the opposite direction of the SDF hut.      “Considering the strength and mind of a child, we thought that he would not head to the mountain tops or off the road,” said a firefighter who was part of the rescue team. The road heading to the SDF facility is bounded by forest and goes uphill.      The distance Tanooka is assumed to have walked is about 10 km.      SDF officers sometimes feel they need to be equipped with survival gear when they travel on that road.      When a Kyodo News reporter walked along the same stretch of road around 5 p.m. on Saturday — exactly a week after Tanooka was left behind — the light began failing among the tall trees even though it was before sunset. After walking for two hours, only two vehicles passed by, apparently driven by locals. No pedestrians were seen.      On Tuesday, three days after Tanooka went missing, rescuers started searching the area uphill from where the boy was last seen. The next day, SDF vehicles went near the training facility.      However, since anyone heading to the SDF facility needs to follow animal trails into the forest for about 50 meters, the rescuers did not search further.      “It’s not totally wrong to assume that there are limited places for a child to travel compared to adults with knowledge and physical strength,” said Yuji Ishikawa, who heads a group of mountain guides in Hokkaido, “but we also need to keep in mind that children might go to places out of the norm.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Yamato Tanooka, the 7-year-old boy who survived for six nights in a forest in northern Japan, has forgiven his father for the ordeal.

Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875. The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of 61 acres (0.25 km2; 0.10 sq mi) was purchased.However, the Queen's Park project... contains an answer for the question: What was the founder of the Artizans Company paid a cent a day to do?, what is it ?

The question is about a negative effect of the invention and use of paper. To answer this question correctly, we need to understand the context of paper's invention and use, and how it impacts our world negatively. Option: 1). increased use of glass bottles.  This seems irrelevant, as glass bottles have no direct correlation to the invention and use of paper. 2). increased number of trees cut down. This seems like a viable option, as paper industry is one of the major contributors to deforestation.  3). decreased pollution in trash dumps.  This seems like a positive impact, not negative. Paper is biodegradable compared to many other materials, so its use could actually decrease pollution. 4). decreased amount of books to read. This is not relevant, as the invention of paper would presumably increase, not decrease, the number of books. By eliminating options 1, 3, and 4, which do not show a negative effect associated with paper invention and use, the most fitting answer that details a negative outcome is: Answer: 2). increased number of trees cut down.

The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to disorganization in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun. He advanced north from Egypt in March 1281, positioned his own army between the Franks and Mongols, and then further divided the potential allies by renewing a truce with the Barons of Acre on May 3, 1281, extending it for another ten years and ten months (a truce he would later breach). He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on July 16, 1281, and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 of their own troops, plus 30,000 others including Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent a contingent even though..., what would be the answer ?

Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust. While attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, FranÃ§ois Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with FranÃ§ois a British poem, \\"Invictus\\", that had inspired him during his time in prison. FranÃ§ois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many blacks, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country. Things begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks... Answer:","output":"How does Nelson Mandela use the 1995 Rugby World Cup and his relationship with the Springboks' captain, François Pienaar, to address racial divisions and unite South Africa in the post-Apartheid era?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Millennium Force, a roller coaster located at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, was the first roller coaster to feature an elevator cable lift system. This innovative system was introduced when the roller coaster opened in 2000.  The elevator cable lift system is a type of lift mechanism that uses a cable driven by a motor at the top of the lift hill. The train gets engaged with the cable at the bottom of the hill, and the cable pulls the train upward at a higher speed compared to a traditional chain lift. The system allows for a smoother, faster, and quieter ascent than a conventional chain lift. In the case of Millennium Force, the system enables the train to climb its 310-foot-tall (94 meters) lift hill at a steep 45-degree angle, reaching the top in just about 20 seconds. The use of an elevator cable lift system on Millennium Force not only allowed for a higher and faster ride, but it also set a new standard for roller coaster design, leading to the development of more advanced and thrilling rides in the following years."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  In the months following Pink Moon's release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant. He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. \\"I don't like it at home,\\" he told his mother, \\"but I can't bear it anywhere else.\\" His return was often difficult for his family; Gabrielle said, \\"good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around, really.\\"Drake lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £238 in 2018). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back.\\" Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: \\"There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around.\\"John Martyn (who in 1973 wrote the title song of his album Solid Air about Drake) described Drake in this period as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose, until he ran out of petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks. He was initially believed to suffer from major depression, although his former therapist suggested he was suffering from schizophrenia. His health problems...  Guess a valid title for it!

How can we do better sex?","output":"While the two questions may seem similar at first glance, they have some subtle differences in their focus and implications. Let's explore their meanings and the potential answers to these questions. 1. \\"How can I have better sex with my wife?\\" This question revolves around improving the sexual experience specifically within the context of a marital relationship. The person asking the question is looking for ways to enhance sexual satisfaction and pleasure for both themselves and their wife. The focus is on the individual's role in this process and how they can contribute to making the experience better. Answers to this question could include: - Communication: Open and honest discussions about each other's desires, fantasies, and boundaries can help both partners understand what brings pleasure and satisfaction to the other. - Emotional intimacy: Strengthening emotional connection through regular quality time spent together, meaningful conversations, and expressions of love and appreciation lays a strong foundation for a fulfilling sexual relationship. - Experimentation: Trying new sexual activities, techniques, or positions can help break the monotony and rekindle the excitement in the bedroom. - Ensuring mutual pleasure: Make an effort to ensure that both partners' needs are met – this includes engaging in adequate foreplay, focusing on mutually enjoyable activities, and addressing any discomfort or concerns. - Educating yourself: Acquiring knowledge about sexual health and techniques through books, articles, or workshops can help individuals become more skilled and confident in the bedroom. 2. \\"How can we do better sex?\\" This question is more general in nature and implies that both partners are equally involved in the process of improving their sexual experience. It suggests a collaborative approach where both partners work together to enhance their sexual relationship and satisfaction. Answers to this question could include: - Open communication: Actively listen and empathize with each other's needs and desires, and create a safe space for open dialogue, without judgment or criticism. - Mutual consent: Ensure that both partners agree on trying new activities and establish boundaries that protect the comfort and safety of each individual. - Emotional connection: Develop a deeper emotional bond by sharing thoughts, feelings, and experiences outside of the bedroom. Emotional intimacy is a key component of a satisfying sexual relationship. - Sexual education: Both partners can educate themselves on various aspects of sexual health and well-being, and share their learnings with one another. This includes understanding anatomy, arousal, and pleasure for optimal sexual experiences. - Explore fantasies: Sharing and exploring each other's fantasies can bring novelty and excitement into the relationship. Mutually agreed-upon fantasies will add variety to your sexual experiences. - Prioritize pleasure: Focus on the journey of pleasure and not just the end goal (orgasm). This includes attentive foreplay, sensual touch, and experimenting with different sensations that bring pleasure to both partners. - Practice patience and mindfulness: Allow for the natural ebb and flow of desire. Being present and attentive during sexual encounters can create deeper connections and more fulfilling experiences. In conclusion, while there is some overlap in the answers to these questions, the key differences lie in their focus and scope. The first question emphasizes the asker's role in enhancing their marital sexual relationship, while the second question highlights a collaborative approach between both partners to improve their sexual experiences."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Here is an article: David Gardner, 50, of Reno is arrested by the LAPD on suspicion of trying… (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles…) A team of burglars has been roaming the streets of downtown Los Angeles, search for aging, vacant buildings they can strip bare. Over the last year, at least four buildings have been stripped clear of copper wiring and other metals during brazen heists that often take days to complete. Police estimate each job can yield 1 million or more in metals — and cost much more for property owners to repair the damage. On Thursday, detectives said they caught one alleged member of the team in the act at the old Garfield Building at 8th and Hill streets. Police swarmed the building after being alerted by construction workers who noticed wet footprints and heard voices. SWAT officers and police dogs crept through the 1928 Art Deco tower in complete darkness, dodging a pipe booby trap the burglars apparently had set up. They arrested a suspect hiding in a dusty corner on the seventh floor. Police believe he and others spent days ripping out newly installed copper wiring from walls, stripping transformers of wire and stealing pipe and sprinkler heads from the 13-floor structure. They found that the burglars apparently had lowered a massive transformer from an upper floor to the basement, using old fire hoses. The basement was stacked with piles of items the burglars planned to remove, police said. Los Angeles Police Department Lt. Paul Vernon said officers believe the team also stripped the vacant Commercial Exchange Building across the street, which, like the Garfield, is being renovated. The estimated loss at that building was 1 million. Suspect David Gardner, 50 of Reno was led away in handcuffs from the Garfield Building. \\"We are booking him for a burglary from September, when 1.5 million worth of copper and other metals were taken. That time he was seen with tools but fled,\\" Vernon said. \\"We believe he is part of a crew or crews who targeted these grand old buildings that are being restored.\\" The burglars at the Garfield went to elaborate lengths, somehow tapping into the power supply to run lights and the heavy tools needed to take the items. Witnesses told police that a van, truck and Japanese import car had been seen parked in back of the vacant building, and detectives believe the vehicles were used to move the stolen items. Police said the thieves burn off insulation to get to wires and burrow into walls seeking valuable copper, which sells for 4.22 a pound. The burglars only make pennies on the real value of the copper and often work for others who take most of the profits, investigators said. Most of the metal is sold to recyclers in Southern California and within days is bound for countries such as China and India, whose rapidly growing economies have enormous needs for metals. For the burglars, it can be a dangerous business. In October, a man was electrocuted and his wife was burned as they stripped wire from an underground vault in South Gate. Two men were killed last year in Riverside County while stealing copper from a utility vault. The Garfield appeared to be a potentially lucrative spot for the ring. In addition to copper wiring, the thieves had stacked large amounts of pipe and sprinkler heads in the basement.

The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's...

Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure  to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected  of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

It simply talks about the origination and the timeline of Buddhism's spread to China, without specifying if and when any translation work by foreign Buddhist monks took place. In the ancient times, translation efforts were so vital because Buddhism was originally taught in several languages, primarily Pali and Sanskrit, which were not understood by the common Chinese populace. Buddhism needed to be translated into the local Chinese language for the ideas to be comprehended and spread. These translation efforts were a massive and significant undertaking, often involving foreign and local monks, state sponsorship and the development of new translation techniques and vocabularies. As such, the start of these efforts marks an important point in the spread of Buddhism to China, one that's separate from the initial transmission of Buddhism to the country via the Silk Road.

It is traditionally written with embossed paper. Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports thanks to refreshable braille displays. They can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser.  Braille is named after its creator, Louis Braille, a Frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident. In 1824, at age 15, he developed a code for the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing. He published his system, which subsequently included musical notation, in 1829. The second revision, published in 1837, was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era.  Braille characters are rectangular blocks called \\"cells\\" containing tiny bumps called \\"raised dots\\". The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another. Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes for printed writing, the mappings (sets of character designations) vary from language to language. Furthermore, in English Braille there are three levels of encoding: Grade 1 – a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy; Grade 2 – an addition of abbreviations and contractions; and Grade 3 – various non-standardized personal shorthands.

IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \\"feel.\\" Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \\"pits\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution? Solve 162*a - 279*a = 133*a + 134*a - 19200 for a.","output":"Okay, let's break it down in a really simple way!  So, we have this fun little math problem with a bunch of the same letters, but don't be scared. These letters are called variables, and right now they're standing in for a number we don't know yet. First, let's simplify the problem a little bit by adding like terms together.  On the left side of the equation, we've got 162*a - 279*a. If you had 162 apples (a) and someone took away 279 apples, you would lose apples, right? The same idea applies here. If we take 279 from 162, we get -117*a. Think of this like having negative or, less than zero, 117 apples. On the right side of the equation we have 133*a and 134*a. If we add those together (just like if we had 133 apples and someone gave us 134 more), we get 267*a. Then, we subtract 19200 (like taking away 19200 apples) which gives us 267*a - 19200. So after all that adding and subtracting of apples, our equation now reads -117*a = 267*a - 19200. Next, to make our equation even simpler, we are going to move that -117*a from the left side to the right side of the equation by adding 117*a to both sides.  This makes our equation: 0 = 267*a + 117*a - 19200. Just like before, we add 267 and 117 together to get 384*a - 19200. With this new equation, our unknown number a is being multiplied by 384 and then have 19200 subtracted. To solve for a, we want to get 'a' all by itself. So, first let's get rid of that -19200 by adding 19200 to both sides of the equation.  This will give us: 19200 = 384*a. Now the only thing left to do is to get a by itself by dividing by 384 on both sides. So, a = 19200 / 384.  After doing the math here, the solution to the problem is a = 50.  Hope this helps! Math can be a little scary but remember, take all the time you need and practice makes perfect!"},{"instruction":"Q:Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Article: SAN FRANCISCO -- In the western U.S., Hawaii and elsewhere across the globe, moon watchers were treated on Saturday to a rare celestial  phenomenon: a total lunar eclipse  . For about 50 minutes starting at 6:06 a.m. PST, the moon was completely blocked by the Earth's shadow. With only some indirect sunlight able to reach it after passing through the Earth's atmosphere, the moon took on a reddish weak light. Since the atmosphere scatters  blue light, only red light strikes the moon, giving it a dark red color1. Dally Sam, who runs a public relations firm in Hawaii, said it had been cloudy and rainy, but the weather cleared just in time for the eclipse. Around 3 a.m., he awoke, as he usually does, and remembered to step outside the house in time to catch the beginning of the eclipse about a half hour later. No one else in the neighborhood was up then. \\"It was turning that dark red color1,\\" Sayre, aged 47, said, \\"I'd better get a camera. To be able to see it just right outside our house was really cool.\\" At the local observatory in Los Angeles, some 300 people, many holding coffee cups in the cold morning air, sat with blankets and chairs on the observatory's great grass land. \\"It's really a celestial festival out here,\\" John Peter, aged 39, told the Los Angeles Times as he set up his camera. Lying on a slope  north of downtown near the Hollywood sign, the place offers clear views of the sky.

Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - EMI (officially EMI Group Limited, originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries and often known as EMI Records and EMI Music) was a British multinational conglomerate founded in March 1931 and was based in London.

Language experts say that the promotion of Putonghua, and the large number of non-Shanghainese setting down in the city have meant that the local dialect has lost its previous high social status, according to the report. They have urged that the dialect be protected alongside Putonghua (also known as Mandarin), the nation's common tongue that has been systematically promoted since new China was founded in 1949.

In 1967, local authorities were empowered to provide family planning advice to any who requested it and to provide supplies free of charge. In addition, medical training was expanded following the Todd Report on medical education in 1968. In addition, National Health expenditure rose from 4.2% of GNP in 1964 to 5% in 1969 and spending on hospital construction doubled. The Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 empowered local authorities to maintain workshops for the elderly either directly or via the agency of a voluntary body. A Health Advisory Service was later established to investigate and confront the problems of long-term psychiatric and mentally subnormal hospitals in the wave of Ely Hospital. The Family Planning Act 1967 empowered local authorities to set up a family planning service with free advice and means-tested provision of contraceptive devices while the Clean Air Act 1968 extended powers to combat air pollution. More money was also allocated to hospitals treating the mentally ill. In addition, a Sports Council was set up to improve facilities. Direct government expenditure on sports more than doubled from £0.9 million in 1964/65 to £2 million in 1967/68, while 11 regional Sports Councils had been set up by 1968. In Wales, five new health centres had been opened by 1968, whereas none had been opened from 1951 to 1964, while spending on health and welfare services in the region went up from £55.8 million in 1963/64 to £83.9 million in 1967/68.

They clean up the mess after traffic collisions. Their emblem is the Totenkopf symbol (skull and crossbones variant) within a pentagram.[4][5] This job leaves him the perfect opportunity to pursue his full-time hobby: necrophilia. He returns home from his job to his apartment and girlfriend, Betty. He plays with his assortment of preserved human remains and watches television while Betty takes a bath in blood-laden water. Their apartment is decorated with centerfolds featuring models, pictures of famed killers, and jars containing human parts, which are preserved in formaldehyde.[4] Rob watches a televised interview of a psychiatrist, speaking on the topic of arachnophobia and ways to overcome phobias.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Orrin Grant Hatch (born March 22, 1934) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States Senator for Utah who has been the President pro tempore of the United States Senate since 2015. Having been a senator since 1977, Hatch is the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history. Hatch served as either the chair or ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1993 to 2005. He previously served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987 and currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee as well as serving on the board of directors for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Hatch has long been a proponent of expanding intellectual property rights, and introduced the Senate version of the Copyright Term Extension Act in 1997. Hatch believes intellectual property laws should, in general, more closely mirror real property laws, and offer greater protections to authors and creators.  Hatch caused an overnight controversy on June 17, 2003 by proposing that copyright owners should be able to destroy the computer equipment and information of those suspected of copyright infringement, including file sharing, he stated that \\"This may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights.\\" In the face of criticism, especially from technology and privacy advocates, Hatch withdrew his suggestion days later, after it was discovered that Sen. Hatch's official website was using an unlicensed JavaScript menu from United Kingdom-based software developer Milonic Solutions. Milonic founder Andy Woolley stated that \\"We've had no contact with them. They are in breach of our licensing terms.\\" Shortly after the publication of that story in Wired magazine, the company that runs Hatch's website contacted Milonic to start registration.  One year later, he proposed the controversial INDUCE Act that attempted to make illegal all tools that could be used for copyright infringement if said tools were intentionally used for illegal copyright infringement.  On September 20, 2010, Hatch once again attempted to outlaw websites which could be used for trademark and copyright infringement through the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA). This bill would authorize the United States Department of Justice to blacklist and censor all websites that the department deemed to be dedicated to \\"infringing activities\\".

Write a title for this article: New natural gas rig counts hit the wires Friday morning and on cue the number decreased yet another 15 rigs to 422, another 21st century low and a massive 55% below the 936 peak one year ago. An article was published by me on July 22nd predicting a spike to 8.00 natural gas by this winter. Well, we are right on track. During that July week natural gas storage numbers were 19.2% and 17.5% respectively above the one and five year averages. Back then we had had eleven straight weeks of below normal storage injections. Since that time we have had a look at thirteen more data points twelve of which were below normal so now the “glut” has diminished to only 6.8% and 7.8% more than the one and five year averages. Thursday’s actual storage injection was 72 Bcf against a 108 Bcf increase one year ago this week. I have continued to inspect decline curves for wells in the Eagle Ford shale. After viewing records for over 70 wells with between nine and eighteen months of production data, the declines continue to be precipitous. A one year decline rate of 80% or more was more the norm than the exception for the data I inspected. In other words a well making 800 BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) on day one, more likely than not was generating well under 200 BOE twelve months later. So I wondered whether there was any recent literature to corroborate my own empirical evidence. Gary Swindell a Dallas, Texas petroleum engineer did an Eagle Ford shale study analyzing 1,041 wells in ten Eagle Ford shale counties with current drilling activity. Similar to my own findings he found decline rates on average were 76%. But he explored much deeper to determine if Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) of a well was dependent on such metrics as frac size in thousands of pounds of sand, distance of the perforated length of the horizontal drill pipe, and the well’s Initial Potential or IP. The conclusion was there was some correlation between more oil and gas produced and bigger and longer fracs up to a point at which time there were diminishing returns. For example, Fracs over 5,000 feet horizontally generally showed lesser returns as did Fracs using over 6,000 pounds of sand. The IP represents the initial production of those first few test days when the well produces at its highest outputs. Swindell also did a simple time test. Were wells getting better, meaning more productive as time passed? Was experience and technology increasing drilling efficacy? Back in July there were lots of criticisms on my previous article claiming how much more efficient drilling is today which more than offsets the dwindling rig supply. The evidence concluded than up until 2010, in the Eagle Ford at least, wells indeed improved, but subsequent to that there has been a plateauwith no increaesed productivity gains for over two years. The most stunning and damning discovery by far was that of the 1,041 wells, the average EUR was only 206,779 BOE per well. Not surprisingly most public companies tend to report or advertise only their IP on a well which is all the SEC and the Texas Railroad Commission requires. They may throw investors a bone and report the first 30 days average production. Many public exploration firms active in the Eagle Ford such as Marathon may publicize EUR’s as high as 340,000 to 500,000 BOE. To my knowledge, no public companies are reporting such rapid well decline rates as are shown in both my limited study and the Swindell report. For investors and analysts to make informed decisions companies should make public after three and six months both the well flow rate (how much the well has declined from IP) and more importantly the surface flowing pressure. Rapidly declining pressure is indicative of a shorter well life and is a predictive measure of well decline rates. Therefore if there really are significantly lower EUR’s than the world has come to take for granted, then the whole shale oil and gas economics must be revisited. While we have proven there are gas vast reserves to be mined, at what price levels does it make sense to pursue these opprtunities? These wells are a mixture of both oil and gas. The study goes through February of 2012. Swindell actually does something kind of weird. The energy or British Thermal Unit (Btu) equivalent of 1 barrel of oil is (Bbl) 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas or 6 Mcf. But because of the huge price differential between oil and gas (it was even more pronounced back then) Mr. Swindell chooses to use a ratio of 20 Mcf to equal 1 Bbl of oil. Therefore when I convert his oil and gas computations (using his 20 to 1 ratio) into a straight natural gas well it shows that each well brings in on average 3.4 Bcf of natural gas reserves. Using the true Btu equivalent ratio would yield even lower reserve numbers. Anyway, the typical 8,000 to 12,000 feet below surface well, be it in the South Texas Eagle Ford or the East Texas/North Louisiana Haynesville play costs plus or minus 10 million. At 4.00 gas this is gross revenue of 13.6 million before deducting a ¼ or 25% royalty payment to the landowners, 7.5%Texas severance tax, 2.5% ad valorem taxes, and well operating expenses. I nearly forgot the pipeline prep to clean the gas of deadly H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) and to rid excess water to below 7 ppm (parts per million.) Now it is ready for the KMP or KMR high pressure pipeline. All this costs about .25. So you are left with about 60% or 2.40 or 8.16 million for your 10 million investment. At 5.00 Mcf gas you break about even and at 6.00 gas the compounded return is under 5%. Don’t forget it takes ten years or more to get most of your money back. There are a lot of pro-forma numbers that have estimated the EUR at Eagle Ford and Hayneville shale plays to be 6 Bcf or almost twice what the studies are showing. In fact 6 Bcf per well was the assumption used in my July article. Also keep in mind gas has only just recently spiked to close to 3.60 and has spent much of the last month or two near 3.00 or below. Drilling for it continues to be a very bad deal. We have six or seven more weeks left in the shoulder season. Our current storage is 236 Bcf higher than last year. With six weeks left, storage injections must average just under 40 Bcf less than last years numbers. I think we will end up below last year’s storage but we can debate, and like Biden and Ryan vociferously disagree. Anyway, let’s compromise and assume storage levels end the shoulder season 120 Bcf above last year. And let’s say we have a normal winter. With what may be less than 400 gas rigs in operation, sooner rather than later supplies will get very strained and a price spike is highly likely. How have we had 23 of the last 24 weeks of below normal storage injections unless gas supplies are slowly and inexorably becoming strained? My thoughts are that the drilling done five and six months ago, that came on line three and four months ago is now going into a very rapid decline period that will soon show up in monthly production numbers. If we have any kind of an early cold snap, 400 rigs will not be able to alleviate tight supplies. We need gas sustainable from 4.50 to 5.00 Mcf to get the gas rig fleet re commissioned. The US Energy Information Association (EIA) household fuel consumption estimates for October 2012 through March 2013 forecasts between 5 and 30% more heating days than the comparable 2011-2012 period. Even the staid EIA predicts 2012 overall demand to increase 4.7% to 69.76 Bcf/day which is in excess of their overall 2012 calculus for gas supply of 68.8 Bcf/day. Time will tell but the tipping point is near.","output":"\\"Understanding the Natural Gas Shortage and Predicting a Price Spike This Winter\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

House passes Ryan budget The House on Wednesday passed a GOP budget blueprint that promises a balanced federal ledger in 10 years by making sweeping cuts across the federal budget and eliminating health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The 219-205 vote on the nonbinding framework takes a mostly symbolic swipe at the government's chronic deficits. Follow-up legislation to actually implement the cuts isn't in the cards. Twelve Republicans opposed the measure, and not a single Democrat supported it. The plan by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., would cut more than 5 trillion over the coming decade to reach balance by 2024. The sharpest cuts would come to health care programs for the poor and uninsured, food stamps, and array of domestic programs, including Pell Grants, education, and community development grants. The follow-up legislation is likely to be limited to a round of annual spending bills that will adhere to a bipartisan budget pact enacted in December. But the Ryan plan paints a picture of what Republicans will try to do if they claim the Senate this fall and the White House in 2016. Its cuts to entrenched benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid, however, would be difficult to pass even if Republicans gain control of both the House and Senate in this fall's elections. Democrats are seizing on the debate to cast Republicans as cruelly cutting programs that keep people out of poverty and help sustain the middle class. \\"It's totally out of touch with the priorities and values of the country,\\" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. \\"This is a clear road map of what Republicans in Congress would do if they had the power to do it.\\" Republicans say the tough cuts they promise would strengthen the economy because less government borrowing would boost savings and investment. And they say it's simply unfair to saddle future generations with mountains of debt. \\"The sooner we tackle these fiscal problems, the better off everybody is going to be, the faster the economy grows, and the more we can guarantee that the next generation inherits a debt-free future,\\" said Ryan. Republicans opposing the bill were mostly tea party adherents such as Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, as well as several members of the Georgia delegation who are competing in a Senate primary. A handful of more moderate members from the Northeast, including Reps. Chris Gibson of New York and Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey, also opposed it. At issue is the arcane congressional budget process, which employs a nonbinding measure known as a budget resolution to set forth goals for future taxes, spending and deficits. But follow-up legislation is usually limited to one-year appropriations bills rather than more difficult measures to deal with the government's long-term fiscal challenges, which are fueled by spiraling health care costs and the retirement of the baby boom generation. Ryan's plan revives a now-familiar list of spending cuts to promise balance, including 2.1 trillion over 10 years in health care subsidies and coverage under the Affordable Care Act; 732 billion in cuts to Medicaid and other health care programs; and almost 1 trillion in cuts to other benefit programs like food stamps, Pell Grants and farm subsidies. Even though it would repeal the Affordable Care Act's benefits, Ryan's plan would preserve its tax increases and cuts to providers, including cuts to private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program. Republicans have attacked Democrats over the Medicare cuts used to finance the new health care law. The measure also promises deep, probably unrealistic cuts to domestic programs like education, health research and grants to local governments that are funded each year through annual appropriations bills. As in the past, Ryan has steered clear of cuts to Social Security, and he promises steady increases for veterans and restoration of looming defense cuts. But he faces a more challenging task to promise to balance the budget by decade's end than he did last year because the Congressional Budget Office projects lagging revenues. Steep cuts to Medicaid, which Ryan proposes to turn into a block grant program managed by the states, could drive millions of people from the program, including seniors in nursing homes and children from low-income households. Ryan's plan also reprises a failed strategy from last year to cut domestic agency operating budgets and shift the money to the Pentagon after 2015. When Republicans tried that last year, the House was unable to pass the follow-up spending bills implementing the cuts. Earlier versions of Ryan's plan have passed the House three times since the GOP won control of the chamber following the 2010 midterm elections. Like the others, this year's plan would require people who enroll in Medicare in 2024 to be given a subsidy -- called \\"premium support\\" by Republicans, derided as a voucher system by Democrats -- with which they would purchase health insurance on the open market. Republicans say the system is required to prevent the budget from spiraling out of control as more baby boomers retire and the present system collapses. They also say the redesigned Medicare program would offer seniors more choices and curb costs. Critics, however, say the Medicare subsidies won't keep up with inflation and will require sharply higher out-of-pocket costs for future seniors.

When their younger sister Polly asks Tom if the Queen is coming to their house, Tom says that she only exists in the story. However, the Snow Queen really does live in an icy palace in the North Pole with her three troll servants: Eric, Baggy, and Wardrobe. Her plan is to set up her huge magic mirror on a mountain to reflect the sunlight away so the entire world will become her kingdom. But the mirror falls down the mountain and lands on the trolls' flying machine where it shatters into pieces. Two of the pieces hit Tom in the eye and the heart that he falls into an evil curse. The Snow Queen sends her bats to retrieve the pieces. As they cannot take the two that are inside Tom, the Queen goes out to kidnap him. Ellie and Tom connect their sleds to a bigger sled that is revealed to be driven by the Snow Queen. She takes Tom to her palace and cuts Ellie off of her sled, causing her to fall onto a talking bird named Peeps. Ellie goes out to save Tom from her and Peeps reluctantly decides to go with her.

Nearly half of British women lie about their dress size to friends, colleagues and partners after failing to slim down for summer. Just eight per cent of women polled were happy with their measurements this summer and it was a svelte size 12 that topped the charts as the most desired shape.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Before the opening of the Cape Cod Canal in 1914,the only way ships could leave Boston was on a route around Race Point--the northern tip of Cape Cod.However,navigation during the 18th century was a nightmare,because the floating cross current  around Race Point caused countless accidents.So building a lighthouse to lighten the place was very necessary. As early as 1808,the people of Provincetown requested a lighthouse on Race Point,but it took Congress eight years to react when they finally paid  8,000 on April 27,1816 to build a lighthouse --Race Point Light,which was located in the town of Provincetown,Massachusetts.It was first built of stone 25 feet high with no foundation and its light was 30 feet above the sea.It was equipped with one of the nation's earliest revolving lights. Actually,there were two other lighthouses on Cape Cod,but they were hit by a storm in October 1841.In the following year,Race Point Light was examined by I.W.P.Lewis,who realized the light's importance.He said,\\"The light should be useful to all ships leaving Boston.However,its _ power is so weak that people would hardly be able to differentiate it from the lights set on the ships which stay in the bay,or close by.It hasn't played its role as a lighthouse well.\\" The result was that old lighthouse was destroyed and a new iron lighthouse with a proper foundation was put up to take its place.The new lighthouse was 45 feet high.Although the original keeper's house was in good repair,it was destroyed too and a new one was built.Today the lighthouse has been automated and Race Point Light is still an active aid to navigation. You can park at Race Point Beach and walk about 45 minutes to the lighthouse.Sunset at Race Point Light is one of the Cape Cod's most popular scenes.And at times whales can be seen in the lighthouse.For reservations to stay one night in the keeper's house at Race Point call(508)487-9930.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: who did russians descend from? Answer:","output":"Russians, the largest ethnic group in Russia, descended from a complex historical background that involves various ancient groups and migration waves. The origin of the Russians can be traced back to the Eastern Slavs, who were a combination of tribes that inhabited the lands between the Carpathian Mountains, the Dnieper River, and the Oka-Don Lowland. Notable groups that contributed to this ethnic mix include the following: 1. East Slavic Tribes: The core of the early Russian people emerged from several East Slavic tribes, such as the Vyatichs, Krivichs, Dregovichs, Radimichs, and Ilmen Slavs. Over time, these tribes shared common customs, languages, and religions, which shaped the historical Russian identity. 2. Varangians: In the 9th century, the Scandinavian Vikings, also known as Varangians, arrived in Eastern Europe. They played a crucial role in establishing the Kievan Rus', the first major East Slavic state. The legendary Varangian leader, Rurik, founded the Rurik Dynasty, which ruled Kievan Rus' and later its successor states, including the Grand Duchy of Moscow. 3. Finno-Ugric Tribes: Finno-Ugric peoples, such as the Merya, Muroma, and Meshchera, inhabited the northeastern parts of today's Russia. They interacted and partially assimilated with the Slavic population, contributing to the Russian ethnogenesis process. 4. Turkic and Mongolic Peoples: Following the Mongol invasion of Rus' in the early 13th century, Russians had long-term contacts with Turkic and Mongolic peoples of the Golden Horde, which ruled over various East Slavic territories for two centuries. This interaction led to the cultural and linguistic exchange that left a lasting impact on the Russian people. 5. Tatars and Bashkirs: Tatars, Bashkirs, and other Turkic peoples from the Volga region also had close interactions with the Russians. A prominent example is the Tatar influence in the development of the early Grand Duchy of Moscow. 6. Other Ethnicities: Throughout history, the territory of modern Russia experienced various migratory waves and invasions, including those of the Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Khazars, Pechenegs, and Cumans. These groups interacted with the nascent Russian population and contributed, to varying degrees, to Russia's ethnogenesis. Ultimately, the modern Russian ethnic identity is the result of many centuries of cultural, linguistic, and genetic interactions between various East Slavic tribes and other neighboring groups. The formation of the Russian state and its expansion throughout the centuries amplified this process, creating a diverse and complex background for the Russian people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number.  Which species' traits would be less common, species A or species B?  Hint: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. A:","output":"In David's exploration of the theory of evolution and natural selection proposed by Darwin and Wallace, he is particularly interested in understanding the differences in population size between species A and species B. As the question specified, species A has some helpful traits, while species B has some harmful traits. We will examine how these differing traits might affect the respective populations of these two deer species, and which species' traits would be less common. The theory of evolution by natural selection, as laid out by Darwin and Wallace, states that heritable traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction will become more common in a population over time. Conversely, harmful traits or those that do not provide a significant benefit to survival and reproduction will become less prevalent. This selective process is driven by the organisms' \\"fitness\\" or their ability to survive and reproduce in a given environment. In the case of species A, which possesses helpful traits, it can be deduced that these traits would provide advantages in terms of survival and reproduction. Organisms within species A would be better suited to their environment because of these traits, resulting in greater reproductive success and, ultimately, an increase in their population size. Over several generations, the proportion of individuals possessing these helpful traits would continue to rise due to the adaptive advantages they provide. On the other hand, species B is characterized by harmful traits that negatively impact their survival and reproductive success. These traits do not provide any benefits for adapting to their environment, and, as a result, the individuals within species B would be at a disadvantage compared to those in species A. The organisms in species B would likely have lower survival rates and decreased reproductive success, leading to a decline in the number of individuals possessing these harmful traits over time. Therefore, when comparing species A and species B, the traits of species B would be less common due to the influence of natural selection acting against their harmful traits. Species A, with their helpful traits, would experience an increase in population size and persistence of these advantageous traits. In summary, David's paper would likely focus on the role that natural selection plays in influencing the prevalence of certain traits in populations, specifically comparing the helpful traits of species A and the harmful traits of species B. The paper could explore how these traits affect each species' survival and reproductive success, leading to differences in population size. Species A's helpful traits would become more common due to their adaptive advantages, while species B's harmful traits would become less common as natural selection works against those traits and favors individuals with more advantageous traits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I recall my mother's voice which called me to order, and often ended with some strong proverb to express the gravity of the wrong done. It was common practice for my mother to send me off soul-searching with a proverb. Of the many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out with clarity. I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung   for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel. I did not manage to hide my feelings from my mother, and after serving the group, she called me to the balcony, where she usually sat to attend to her sewing  . Looking straight into my eyes, she said, \\"Tsholofelo, why were you so unhappy when I requested you to prepare a meal for those poor people?\\" Despite my attempt to deny her allegation  , and using the heat of the fire and the sun as an excuse for my alleged behavior, Mother, giving me a firm look, said, \\"A foot has no nose.\\" It means, \\"You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.\\" Had I denied the group of people a meal, it may have happened that, in my travels some time in the future, I found myself at the mercy of those very individuals. As if that was not enough to shame me, Mother continued, \\"A person is a person because of another person.\\" Question: What was Tsholofelo's attitude towards the meal? Options: A: Unwilling. B: Interested. C: Critical. D: Unconcerned. Answer:","output":"A: Unwilling. Explanation: Tsholofelo was not happy about preparing the meal for the group of work-seekers due to the inconvenience of making an open fire in the high heat. They attempted to hide their feelings but failed to do so.

This article: In 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter.

By Joel Christie and Associated  Press Reporter Investigators believe the missing pregnant wife of a California-based Marine may have been shot while hunting with a married ex-Marine with whom she was having an affair. Court documents say that on the day she disappeared three weeks ago, 20-year-old Erin Corwin had planned to meet with Christopher Brandon Lee to spend a day together on a hunting trip, according to an affidavit obtained by The Desert Sun. The detective's affidavit shows the investigation is focusing on married father-of-one Lee, 24, who may have been the father of Corwin's child. The affidavit also states Lee's wife, Nichole Lee, told a friend police 'would never find the body' and that she scolded her husband for 'not being able to keep his lies straight when he was interviewed by detectives because he was dumb'. The device turned out to be a potato gun, but OPTIONS: - Associated  Press was held for two days before being released on bail. - California was held for two days before being released on bail. - Christopher Brandon Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. - Corwin was held for two days before being released on bail. - Erin Corwin was held for two days before being released on bail. - Joel Christie was held for two days before being released on bail. - Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. - Marine was held for two days before being released on bail. - Nichole Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. - The Desert Sun. was held for two days before being released on bail.","output":"- Christopher Brandon Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. The correct answer is that Christopher Brandon Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. This is because the story revolves around the suspicion that Lee may have been involved in the disappearance of Erin Corwin, with whom he was having an affair. As a suspect in the case, it's logical that he would be the one held for questioning before being released. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - Associated Press, Joel Christie, and The Desert Sun are all news-related entities, not individuals connected to the story. - California and Marine refer to locations, not specific individuals involved in the case. - Erin Corwin is the missing pregnant wife, and being a victim, it would be inappropriate for her to be held. - Nichole Lee is Christopher's wife and although she expressed doubts about his ability to keep his story straight, there is no information in the text indicating that she was held or involved in the incident herself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bernhard was born Bernhard Leopold Friedrich Eberhard Julius Kurt Karl Gottfried Peter, Count of Biesterfeld in Jena, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, German Empire on 29 June 1911, the elder son of Prince Bernhard of Lippe and his wife, Armgard von Cramm. He was a grandson of Ernest, Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld, who was regent of the Principality of Lippe until 1904. He was also a nephew of the principality's last sovereign Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe. Bernhard met then-Princess Juliana at the 1936 Winter Olympics at Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Juliana's mother, Queen Wilhelmina, had spent most of the 1930s looking for a suitable husband for Juliana. As a Protestant of royal rank (the Lippe-Biesterfelds were a sovereign house in the German Empire), Bernhard was acceptable for the devoutly religious Wilhelmina. Wilhelmina left nothing to chance, and had her lawyers draft a very detailed prenuptial agreement that specified exactly what Bernhard could and could not do. The couple's engagement was announced on 8 September 1936, and they were married at The Hague on 7 January 1937. Earlier, Bernhard had been granted Dutch citizenship, and changed the spelling of his names from German to Dutch. Previously styled as Serene Highness, he became a Royal Highness by Dutch Law. His appropriateness as consort of the future Queen would later become a matter of some public debate.  Prince Bernhard was father of six children, four of them with Queen Juliana. The eldest daughter is Princess Beatrix, former Queen of the Netherlands, (1938). His other daughters with Juliana are Irene (1939), Margriet (1943) and Christina (1947).  He had two illegitimate daughters. The first is Alicia von Bielefeld (born 21 June 1952), whose mother has not been identified. She is a landscape architect and lives in the United States. Prince Bernhard's sixth daughter, Alexia Grinda (a.k.a. Alexia Lejeune or Alexia Grinda-Lejeune, born in Paris on 10 July 1967), is his child by the French socialite and fashion model Helene Grinda. Although rumours about these two children had already spread, it was made official after his death. In December 2008, Dutch historian Cees Fasseur claimed that former British Conservative Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken was the result of a wartime affair between Prince Bernhard and Aitken's mother, previously Penelope Maffey. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Who was he married to?","output":"Prince Bernhard was married to Princess Juliana.

He arrives suddenly, bedraggled and exhausted, and begins describing the strange experiences he has had since they last met. At their earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George said that time was \\"the fourth dimension\\". He shows David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp a small model time machine and asks one of them to press a tiny lever on the model. The device disappears, validating his claim, but his friends remain unconvinced; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal. George bids his guests a good evening, then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future to September 15, 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in a war. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping on June 19, 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \\"a new war\\"; George resumes his journey and his house is hit by a bomb and is destroyed. George stops on August 19, 1966 finding his neighborhood now part of a futuristic metropolis. People hurry into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover. Moments later, a nuclear explosion destroys London, causing a volcanic eruption around him. George narrowly makes it back to his machine and continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly rises, cools, and hardens, trapping him inside.

What sort of situation did the bring around the governor?  Here are possible answers to this question: - shock - sorrow - controversy - fear - pain  I believe the correct choice is \\"controversy\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Controversy,\\" and this can be explained in several ways. When the senator went public with the news about what was truly happening in the governor's office, it likely led to a variety of reactions, both from the public and within the political sphere. First and foremost, the disclosure of negative or underhanded information about a government official – in this case, the governor – would naturally cause controversy. This controversy can manifest in several ways, such as public outrage, media scrutiny, and debate amongst political officials. When the senator exposed the true state of affairs in the governor's office, the public would likely feel betrayed, concerned, or even angry about the information. This uproar would directly impact the governor's standing in the public's eye, creating a challenging environment for them to continue governing effectively. Secondly, the revelations would also result in controversy within the political sphere. With the information brought forward by the senator, there would likely be numerous calls from other elected officials for investigations or inquiries into the governor's conduct. This could lead to tensions and heated discussions between political parties and amongst the governor's colleagues. Additionally, the governor may face potential impacts on their political career, such as loss of support from their political party or donors, reduced chances for reelection or future political opportunities, and possible legal consequences if laws were broken. Moreover, the media would play a significant role in the controversy surrounding the governor. As the news spreads, media will likely analyze, discuss, and dissect the information, adding a layer of public pressure on the governor. This increased scrutiny could lead to further revelations or even encourage other individuals to come forward with their own information about the governor's office. Consequently, the scandal would remain in the public eye for an extended period, making it difficult for the governor to regain trust and continue their work without distraction. While it is true that shock, sorrow, fear, and pain could be reactions to the situation, they do not entirely encompass the consequences brought about by the senator's public announcement. These emotions might be felt by the governor, their family, or even their supporters, but the overarching reaction brought about by the exposure of potentially unethical or illegal actions within the governor's office is controversy. This controversy can have far-reaching effects on not only the governor but also the entire political landscape, directly or indirectly impacting the lives and careers of many individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue the following story. The room of Samantha is very clean, while Erin's is a disaster because  Choices:  (A). Samantha is disorganized.  (B). Erin is disorganized.","output":"(B). Erin is disorganized. In the colorful, comfortable universe where Samantha and Erin coexist, an unexpected phenomenon unfolds before anyone who dares to enter their shared space. On one side, Samantha's room is the model of cleanliness and organization, an immaculate realm that sparkles with freshness and purpose. Not a speck of dust defiles the cool glass surface of the oakwood desk. Each pencil, each eraser, each meticulously highlighted textbook has its place, ordered on the shelves with an almost military rigidity. The linen curtains are often drawn back to allow the sunshine to creep into Samantha's room, bringing with it suggestions of a carefully lived life of discipline and self control. Her bed is flawless, its covers and pillows neatly arranged in placid patterns that seem to defy the very idea of wrinkles. The neatly arranged photo frames, the squeaky clean mirror and the dust-free vanity all sing hymes of Samantha's virtues, painting the picture of a disciplined, systematic individual who thrives on scheduling and orderliness. She follows a strict regimen, waking up before dawn and retiring for the night well before any late-night vigils can occur. Samantha's prized possessions are her diaries and planners, filled with meticulous records of her daily routines and future plans, each precisely organized by date and time.  Her well-oiled routine, strict discipline, and her exceptional talent for organization could put even the most sophisticated AI to shame. She has an innate sense of purpose and direction which provides a canvas to her artistic orderliness. Everything in her room reflects a portion of the woman she is- the pursuer of perfection, the symbol of efficiency, the embodiment of neatness. On the other hand, Erin's room is a direct contrast. It resembles a field after a storm – full of misplacement, disarray, and chaos. One has to navigate carefully through a cluttered ocean of scattered clothes, strewn books, and forgotten coffee mugs. If cleanliness and orderliness had an adversary, Erin's room would be it. It wouldn't be surprising to find a lost civilization underneath the mess of her room. In Erin's universe, order and system seem like far-fetched dreams. The floor often resumes the responsibility of a closet, hosting an array of clothing that would be better placed neatly organized in the spacious wardrobe. The desk drowns under unintentional layers of trinkets, sketches, and a cacophony of art supplies. Books sprout around the room like weeds, having made their home on the floor, under the bed, on the side table, and sometimes, even the bed.  Erin sleeps whenever sleep graces her and wakes up to a different rhythm each day. To the meticulously organized Samantha's bewilderment, Erin's inconsistent routine and chaotic lifestyle doesn't seem like an obstacle to her cheerfulness or creativity. She often brushes off her roommate's disapproving gaze with a simple, \\"Creativity needs a mess.\\" Therefore, it's clear that Erin's room is a disaster because Erin is disorganized. Despite their starkly contrasting habitats, Samantha and Erin continue living together as two sides of the same coin representing two vastly different ways of living. Samantha's room, an epitome of cleanliness and organization, exemplifies her well-ordered life. At the same time, Erin's disorganized room reflects her unstructured life filled with spur-of-the-moment decisions and spontaneous creativity. Their living arrangements tell a story that extends far beyond the cleanliness or messiness of their rooms. They are living proofs that individual habits, personality attributes, and personal choices resonate profoundly in the spaces they occupy. Samantha’s clarity of thought is narrated through her neat room, while Erin’s scattered brilliance reverberates in her messy one. So perhaps, Samantha and Erin's world is an unforgettable symphony of contrasting melodies that somehow, in the grand orchestra of life, harmonize perfectly. Their rooms, thus, personify them and tell stories of their journey and the lifestyle they have chosen to lead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Student:","output":"In eukaryotes, the major mechanism for shuffling genes is known as recombination, specifically meiotic recombination.  Looking at this step by step: 1. Firstly, we need to understand what eukaryotes are. Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within membranes. This includes animals, plants, and fungi. 2. Secondly, the term 'shuffling genes' refers to the process of genes changing their positions. This mechanism is vital for generating genetic diversity which is crucial for evolution. 3. Lastly, we know that the process of meiotic recombination is where the shuffling of genes takes place in eukaryotes. During meiosis, which is the process of cell division that produces reproductive cells, homologous chromosomes pair up and can exchange segments of DNA in a process known as crossover. This crossover results in the reshuffling or rearrangement of genes, leading to offspring having distinct combinations of traits from their parents. So, weaving all this information together, the major mechanism for shuffling genes in eukaryotes is meiotic recombination."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jeanette Anna MacDonald (June 18, 1903 - January 14, 1965) was an American singer and actress best remembered for her musical films of the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier (The Love Parade, Love Me Tonight, The Merry Widow and One Hour With You) and Nelson Eddy (Naughty Marietta, Rose-Marie, and Maytime). During the 1930s and 1940s she starred in 29 feature films, four nominated for Best Picture Oscars ( In the mid-1950s, MacDonald toured in summer stock productions of Bitter Sweet and The King and I. She opened in Bitter Sweet at the Iroquois Amphitheater, Louisville, Kentucky, on July 19, 1954. Her production of The King and I opened August 20, 1956, at the Starlight Theatre. While performing there, she collapsed. Officially, it was announced as heat prostration, but in fact it was a heart seizure. She began limiting her appearances and a reprisal of Bitter Sweet in 1959 was her last professional appearance.  MacDonald and her husband, Gene Raymond, toured in Ferenc Molnar's The Guardsman. The production opened at the Erlanger Theater, Buffalo, New York, on January 25, 1951, and played in 23 northeastern and midwestern cities until June 2, 1951. Despite less than enthusiastic comments from critics, the show played to full houses for virtually every performance. The leading role of \\"The Actress\\" was changed to \\"The Singer\\" to allow MacDonald to add some songs. While this pleased her fans, the show still closed before reaching Broadway.  In the 1950s, talks with respect to a Broadway return occurred. In the 1960s, MacDonald was approached about starring on Broadway in a musical version of Sunset Boulevard. Harold Prince recounts in his autobiography, visiting MacDonald at her home in Bel Air to discuss the proposed project. Composer Hugh Martin also wrote a song for the musical entitled, \\"Wasn't It Romantic?\\".  MacDonald also made a few nightclub appearances. She sang and danced at The Sands and The Sahara in Las Vegas in 1953, The Coconut Grove in Los Angeles in 1954, and again at The Sahara in 1957, but she never felt entirely comfortable in the smoky atmosphere.

Title: Great Album Product review: Although i like Sarah McLachlan the best, Chantal is probably the most skilled musician out of all the canadian women artists.Whereas Sarah's songs are mostly cryptic and somber with lyrics that are open to your own interpretation, Chantal is mostly upbeat and direct, but still original enough to leave an impression. I would recommend all of Chantal's albums.. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","output":"This review depicts the product in a flattering light. The reviewer highlights Chantal's skills as a musician, comparing her favorably to popular Canadian musician Sarah McLachlan. By pointing out that Chantal's music is upbeat, direct, and original, the reviewer is expressing their appreciation for Chantal's unique style, conveying a positive impression.

Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digesta along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): How many kilocalories of energy per gram is dietary fiber able to produce when successfully metabolized?","output":"Dietary fiber can produce 4 kilocalories of energy per gram when it is successfully metabolized. But, it usually gives less energy than that because our body cannot fully digest it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the sentiment of the following review? This is the saddest review that I will ever give.  Most of you remember going to the old Civic Center, in fact, going there in August, getting up early, making the long line to get tickets for the Broadway shows, or when Itzhak Perlman came around (sigh, that's still one of the top nights of my life...), and seriously, it was a JOY having such a fantastically old building, so much character, so much value.  Then they go to invest millions of money Madison doesn't have, and make this GOD AWFUL building made out of glass.  Ok, so the decor is not the important part (although HELLO... modern much, in the midst of lovely brick buildings is NOT good), it's the experience.  WHICH SUCKS by the way.  I've been both a member of the audience as well as a musician performing.  As an audience, it SUCKS to pay ~90 for good seats on a show, and BARELY being able to hear the performance.  Sound engineering FAILED MISERABLY here.  As a performer, backstage is deplorable and quite inconvenient.  Save your money, and go to Chicago for good shows.    Sadly, Madison's trick to push all the students out of the downtown area, and move in the Yuppies is failing, or maybe the yuppies don't have good appreciation of music, and as long as it costs a lot it *MUST* be good...","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses a deep sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the new building and its impact on the overall experience of attending or performing in shows. They nostalgically recall the older Civic Center with fond memories and contrast it unfavorably with the new glass building which they find unattractive and poorly designed. The reviewer is specifically critical of the décor of the new building, which they feel clashes with the surrounding area's aesthetics. Additionally, they find the overall experience of attending a show to be subpar, with a particular emphasis on the poor sound engineering and high ticket prices, which results in an unsatisfactory audience experience. As a performer, the reviewer also mentions significant inconvenience with the deplorable backstage conditions. The statement on Madison's trick to push students out of the downtown area and make way for yuppies suggests the reviewer's disapproval of this perceived strategy, associating it with the decline in the quality of shows in the area. Their closing advice to save money and go to Chicago instead further emphasizes the negative sentiment of the review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seattle would trail early in the first quarter as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney got a 37-yard field goal, along with running back Frank Gore getting a 79-yard touchdown run. The Seahawks would respond in the second quarter as kicker Olindo Mare made a 36-yard field goal. San Francisco would reply with Nedney making a 42-yard field goal. As the Seahawks looked to bounced back from the deficit, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck received an injury as he was hit on the ground by 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis. Hasselbeck would leave the game with cracked ribs, yet Seattle closed out the half with backup Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones. In the third quarter, the Seahawks deficit quickly increased as on the 49ers' first offensive play of the second half, Gore would explode for an 80-yard touchdown run. San Francisco would close the game out in the fourth quarter as Nedney nailed a 39-yard field goal. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many more yards in field goals did Joe Nedney have compared to Olindo Mare?","output":"In this game, Joe Nedney, the 49ers kicker, made field goals of 37, 42, and 39 yards. Olindo Mare, the Seahawks kicker, made a field goal of 36 yards. To find the difference in yards, we first need to add up the yards of field goals made by Joe Nedney: 37 + 42 + 39 = 118 yards. Now, we need to subtract Olindo Mare's field goal yards: 118 - 36 = 82 yards. So, Joe Nedney had 82 more yards in field goals compared to Olindo Mare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a detailed process to get rid of gnats: 1. Identify the type of gnats: Determine if they are fruit flies, fungus gnats, or drain flies as this will help you target the root cause of the infestation. 2. Eliminate breeding grounds:    a. Dispose of rotting fruits and vegetables as they attract fruit flies.    b. Keep your kitchen and dining area clean by wiping countertops and tables, and washing dishes promptly.    c. Regularly take out the trash and use a bin with a tight-fitting lid.    d. Address damp areas in your home that may harbor fungus gnats, such as over-watered potted plants.    e. Clear debris from your drains, sinks, and showerheads as they can attract drain flies. 3. Create a gnat trap:    a. Vinegar trap: Mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and water in a small container or jar. Add a few drops of dish soap to break the surface tension. Cover the container with a plastic wrap, poke small holes in it, and place it near the gnat-infested area. Gnats are attracted by the vinegar smell, but the dish soap makes them unable to escape.    b. Wine trap: Pour a small amount of red or white wine into a dish, add a few drops of dish soap, and place it near the gnat-infested area. The smell of wine attracts gnats, and the dish soap drowns them. 4. Natural remedies:    a. Essential oils: Add a few drops of peppermint, lavender, or citronella essential oil to water in a spray bottle. Shake well and spray around infested areas. The scent of these oils acts as a natural repellent.    b. Hydrogen peroxide: To target fungus gnats in potted plants, mix a solution of 1 part 3% hydrogen peroxide to 4 parts water. Apply this mixture to the soil, which should kill the larvae without harming the plants. 5. Chemical treatments: If the infestation persists, consider using commercially available gnat traps or insecticides specifically designed for gnats. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for safe and effective use. 6. Prevent future infestations:    a. Store fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator or sealed containers.    b. Regularly clean drains and maintain a dry environment around sinks and showerheads.    c. Keep indoor plants healthy and avoid over-watering them. By following these steps, you can effectively eliminate gnats from your home and prevent future infestations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If we are able to catch a disease early we the chance of curing it is less likely or more likely? Answer:","output":"If a disease, particularly cancer, is caught early, the chance of curing it is significantly more likely. The statement holds especially true for cancer because the nature of this disease involves the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Early detection and treatment can significantly increase the chance of a successful outcome for several reasons: 1. Tumor size: When cancer is detected at an early stage, the tumor tends to be smaller and more localized. In such cases, surgical removal of the tumor has a greater likelihood of being successful. Moreover, smaller tumors often cause less damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. 2. Less aggressive treatment: Early-stage cancer usually requires less aggressive treatment compared to advanced-stage cancer. For example, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, which can have severe side effects, might not always be necessary if cancer is caught early. This allows the patient to have a better quality of life during and after treatment. 3. Lower chance of metastasis: Cancer cells have the potential to spread to other parts of the body, a process known as metastasis. Early detection and treatment reduce the chance of metastasis, as the cancer cells have less time to invade other tissues. Cancers that have not spread are typically easier to treat and have better prognoses. 4. Improved long-term outcomes: Numerous studies have shown that early detection and treatment of cancer lead to higher survival rates and overall improved long-term outcomes. Patients who have early-stage cancer have a better chance of achieving long-lasting remission and experiencing fewer complications. 5. Early intervention and lifestyle changes: Detecting a disease early also provides an opportunity to make necessary lifestyle changes and start preventive care measures. For example, individuals diagnosed with early-stage cancer might benefit from a healthier diet, regular exercise, quitting smoking, or limiting alcohol intake to reduce the risk of recurrence. 6. Faster recovery: Patients who receive treatment at an early stage are likely to recover more quickly than those with advanced cancer. The physical, emotional, and financial burden of cancer treatment is often less for individuals whose cancer was detected early. In conclusion, catching a disease, particularly cancer, at an early stage significantly increases the likelihood of curing it. Early detection enables more effective treatment and helps prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the body. Moreover, early intervention may reduce the need for aggressive treatment, improving the patient's quality of life and increasing their chances of a successful outcome. Therefore, it is crucial to be proactive about health screening and regular check-ups to ensure early detection and timely treatment of potential health issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: To bake bread, you can How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of baking bread, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Gather ingredients To start, I would gather all the necessary ingredients such as flour, water, yeast, sugar, salt, and any additional flavors (like herbs or seeds) that I'd like to include in the bread. Step 2: Activate the yeast In a small bowl, I would mix warm water (around 110°F or 45°C), sugar, and yeast. I would let the mixture sit for about 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy. This step is crucial for ensuring the yeast is active and ready to help the bread rise. Step 3: Combine the ingredients In a large mixing bowl, I would combine the flour and salt. I would then create a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the activated yeast mixture. I would use a wooden spoon or my hands to gradually mix the ingredients until a shaggy dough forms. Step 4: Knead the dough On a clean, floured surface, I would turn out the dough and begin kneading it. I would knead for 10-15 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, I would add a little more flour as needed. Step 5: First rise I would shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl, turning the dough to ensure it is coated with a thin layer of oil. I would then cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. Step 6: Shape the dough After the dough has risen, I would punch it down to release any air bubbles. I would then transfer the dough to a floured surface and shape it into the desired loaf shape (e.g., a round boule, a long baguette, or a traditional loaf). Step 7: Second rise I would place the shaped dough on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet (or in a greased loaf pan), cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise again for about 45 minutes to an hour, or until it has almost doubled in size. Step 8: Preheat the oven While the dough is going through its second rise, I would preheat the oven to around 375°F (190°C) to ensure it's hot enough for baking. Step 9: Scoring and baking Once the dough has finished its second rise, I would use a sharp knife or a bread lame to make a few shallow slashes on the top of the loaf. This is known as scoring and helps control the expansion of the bread as it bakes. I would then place the bread in the preheated oven and bake for 25-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Step 10: Cooling and storing After baking, I would remove the bread from the oven and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, I would store the bread in an airtight container or bread box to keep it fresh and prevent it from drying out. By following these steps, I can accomplish the goal of baking a delicious loaf of homemade bread."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An aspect of Adi Parashakti , Dakshayani is the first consort of Shiva , the second being Parvati , the reincarnation of Sati herself . In Hindu legend , both Sati and Parvati successively play the role of bringing Shiva away from ascetic isolation into creative participation with the world . The act of Sati , in which a Hindu widow immolates herself on her husband 's funeral pyre as a final and consummate act of loyalty and devotion , is patterned after the deed committed by this goddess to uphold the honour of her husband .  - An abugida (from Ge'ez  \\"äbugida\\"), or alphasyllabary, is a segmental writing system in which consonantvowel sequences are written as a unit: each unit is based on a consonant letter, and vowel notation is secondary. This contrasts with a full alphabet, in which vowels have status equal to consonants, and with an abjad, in which vowel marking is absent, partial, or optional. (In less formal contexts, all three types of script may be termed alphabets.) The terms also contrast them with a syllabary, in which the symbols cannot be split into separate consonants and vowels. Abugidas include the extensive Brahmic family of scripts of South and Southeast Asia, Semitic Ethiopic scripts, and Canadian Aboriginal syllabics.  - Shaivism or aivism (\\"aiva Patha\\",  \\"Shiva's Path\\"), also known as Shivaism and Saivam, is one of the major branches of Sanathan Dharma (Hinduism), revering Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce god Bhairava. Followers of Shaivam are called \\"Shaivas\\", \\"Saivas\\", \\"Shaivites\\", or \\"Saivarkal\\".

Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.   - Lakshmi (Sanskrit: , \\",\\" ) is the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity. She is the wife and shakti (energy) of Vishnu, a major god in Hinduism. Lakshmi is also an important deity in Jainism and found in Jain temples. Lakshmi was also a Goddess of abundance and fortune for Buddhists, and was represented on the oldest surviving stupas and cave temples of Buddhism. In Buddhist sects of Tibet, Nepal and southeast Asia, goddess Vasudhara mirrors the characteristics and attributes of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi with minor iconographic differences.  - Parvati (IAST: Prvat) is the Hindu goddess of fertility, love and devotion; as well as of divine strength and power. She is the gentle and nurturing aspect of the Hindu goddess Shakti and one of the central deities of the Goddess-oriented Shakta sect. She is the mother goddess in Hinduism, and has many attributes and aspects. Each of her aspects is expressed with a different name, giving her over 100 names in regional Hindu stories of India. Along with Lakshmi (goddess of wealth and prosperity) and Saraswati (goddess of knowledge and learning), she forms the trinity of Hindu goddesses (Tridevi).  - The Tridevi (Sanskrit:  \\"\\") is a concept in Hinduism joining a triad of eminent goddesses either as a feminine version of the Trimurti or as consorts of a masculine Trimurti, depending on denomination. This triad is typically personified by the Hindu goddesses Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati (Kali). In Shaktism, these triune goddesses are the manifestations of Mahashakti, the supreme divinity.  - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies.  - Saraswati is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, arts, wisdom and learning worshipped throughout Nepal and India . She is a part of the trinity (\\"Tridevi\\") of Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati. All the three forms help the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva to create, maintain and regenerate-recycle the Universe respectively.  - Shiva ( Tamil Sanskrit: , lit. \\"the auspicious one\\") is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the supreme God within Shaivism, one of the three most influential denominations in contemporary Hinduism.  - Hindu refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, rather than a religious identifier for people indigenous to South Asia.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari:  , \\"Mnak Hind\\") or simply Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Hind\\"), is an Indian language and a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language. Hindi is one of the official languages of India, and is the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Hindi belt languages. Outside India, Hindi is an official language in Fiji, and is a recognised regional language in Mauritius, Suriname, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago.  - Devanagari (, a compound of \\"\\"deva\\"\\" and \\"\\"ngar\\"\\" ; Hindi pronunciation: ), also called Nagari (\\"Ngar\\"), is an abugida (alphasyllabary) alphabet of India and Nepal. It is written from left to right, has a strong preference for symmetrical rounded shapes within squared outlines, and is recognisable by a horizontal line that runs along the top of full letters. In a cursory look, the Devanagari script appears different from other Indic scripts such as Bengali, Oriya, or Gurmukhi, but a closer examination reveals they are very similar except for angles and structural emphasis.  - Hinduism is a religion, or a way of life, found most notably in India and Nepal. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as \\"\\", \\"the eternal law,\\" or the \\"eternal way,\\" beyond human origins. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \\"Hindu synthesis\\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE following the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE).  - In Hinduism, Shakti (Devanagari: ; from Sanskrit \\"shak\\", \\"to be able\\"), also spelled as Sakthi, meaning \\"power\\" or \\"empowerment\\" is the primordial cosmic energy and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire universe. Shakti is the concept or personification of divine feminine creative power, sometimes referred to as 'The Great Divine Mother' in Hinduism. As the mother she is known as Adi Parashakti or Adishakti. On the earthly plane, Shakti most actively manifests through female embodiment and creativity/fertility, though it is also present in males in its potential, unmanifest form.

Movie title: Westworld Context: Sometime in the near future a high-tech, highly realistic adult amusement park called Delos features three themed \\"worlds\\"Â â West World (the American Old West), Medieval World (medieval Europe), and Roman World (the ancient Roman city of Pompeii). The resort's three \\"worlds\\" are populated with lifelike androids that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For 1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and even a fight to the death. Delos' tagline in its advertising promises, \\"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\\" Peter Martin (Benjamin), a first-time Delos visitor, and his friend John Blane (Brolin), on a repeat visit, go to West World. One of the attractions is the Gunslinger (Brynner), a robot programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting humans or anything with a high body temperature but allow them to 'kill' the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the robot always returning the next day for another duel. The technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to spread like an infection among the androids: the robots in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to West World.
