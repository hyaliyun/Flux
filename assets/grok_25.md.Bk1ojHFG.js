Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Southern Africa is the southernmost region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics, and including several countries. The term \\"southern Africa\\" or \\"Southern Africa\\", generally includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. From a political perspective the region is said to be unipolar with South Africa as a first regional power.  - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map).  - Sub-Saharan Africa is, geographically, the area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara desert. According to the UN, it consists of all African countries that are fully or partially located south of the Sahara. It contrasts with North Africa, whose territories are part of the League of Arab states within the Arab world. Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros and Mauritania are geographically in Sub-Saharan Africa, but are likewise Arab states and part of the Arab world.  - In the geologic timescale, the Capitanian is an age or stage of the Permian. It is also the uppermost or latest of three subdivisions of the Guadalupian epoch or series. The Capitanian lasted between and . It was preceded by the Wordian and followed by the Wuchiapingian.  - Tapinocephalia is one of the major groups of dinocephalian therapsids and the major herbivorous group. Tapinocephalia is thought to consist of three clades: Styracocephalidae, Titanosuchidae, and the very successful Tapinocephalidae. Notable tapinocephalians include \\"Moschops\\", \\"Tapinocephalus\\", and \\"Titanosuchus\\".  - In the geologic timescale, the Wuchiapingian or Wujiapingian (from in the Liangshan area of Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province) is an age or stage of the Permian. It is also the lower or earlier of two subdivisions of the Lopingian epoch or series. The Wuchiapingian spans the time between and million years ago (Ma). It was preceded by the Capitanian and followed by the Changhsingian.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.  - Keratocephalus ( \`\` horned head '' ) is an extinct genus of tapinocephalian therapsid from the early Capitanian age of South Africa . It was found in the Lower and Middle Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone of the Karoo deposits , in the Lower Beaufort Beds in Beaufort West .  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - The Permian is a geologic period and system which spans 46.7 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic Period 252.2 Mya. It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the city of Perm.  - Therapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors. Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body, as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles. The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is \\"Tetraceratops insignis\\" from the Lower Permian.   - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used.  - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.    What entity does 'keratocephalus' has the relation 'parent taxon' with? A:","output":"Keratocephalus has the relation 'parent taxon' with the group Tapinocephalia. Tapinocephalia is a major group of dinocephalian therapsids and includes herbivorous members such as Keratocephalus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Kierkegaard criticised Hegel's idealist philosophy in several of his works, particularly his claim to a comprehensive system that could explain the whole of reality. Where Hegel argues that an ultimate understanding of the logical structure of the world is an understanding of the logical structure of God's mind, Kierkegaard asserting that for God reality can be a system but it cannot be so for any human individual because both reality and humans are incomplete and all philosophical systems imply completeness. A logical system is possible but an existential system is not. \\"What is rational is actual; and what is actual is rational\\".

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

It was previously updated with additional context from the Portland Water Bureau. PWB said they started draining the \\"contaminated\\" reservoir last Wednesday, but then started diverted to Reservoir 6 on Monday of this week.      Turns out, they didn't flush it all.      Yet.      More than an hour into a community budget hearing at David Douglas High School in East Portland Tuesday night, Commissioner Nick Fish responded to a neighbor's question about Mt. Tabor's future with an off-topic, but important update on the city's recent internationally famous public urination episode.      \\"We will keep the water in Reservoir 6 for now,\\" Fish said.      The water, is the so-called \\"contaminated water\\" that made national headlines last week      thanks to a Portland area teen.      The Portland Water Bureaus started draining Reservoir 5, the crime scene of the alleged urination, on Wednesday of last week. But draining 38 million gallons takes days, and by Monday of this week, just 2-3 million gallons had been drained into city sewers.      Water officials started to divert the remaining 35-36 million gallons of water to Reservoir 6 on Monday morning. \\"The rate of draining Res 5 was slow,\\" said public information officer Jaymee Cuti, \\"and we wanted to get it back into service.\\"      Fish, who oversees both the Water Bureau and Bureau of Environmental Services, said just last week that flushing the 38 million gallon reservoir was the \\"conservative but correct\\" call. The decision made national headlines, from the Huffington Post to NPR to blogs and wire services across the globe.      But on Tuesday, Fish said the \\"urination incident gave us an opportunity\\" to \\"test drive\\" and see whether the city could indeed keep water in the open air reservoirs even after the covered reservoirs at Kelly Butte and Powell Butte come online. Portland is required by the federal government to retire its open air reservoirs, despite years of fighting.      Shifting the remaining water also has \\"the added benefit\\" Cuti said of making the vacant Reservoir 6 \\"more attractive.\\" Cuti did not immediately have figures or estimates of the amount of contaminated water that was drained prior to Monday's about-face.      Fish said there's no timetable for when the city may flush what remains of the contaminated water.      Portland stopped using Reservoir 6 for drinking water in October 2010, according to Cuti. She said the reservoir was \\"valved off\\" for the past few years because the city didn't need the added storage capacity.            City surveillance video showed Portland teen Dallas Swonger allegedly urinating in Reservoir 5, one of Mt Tabor's three open air reservoirs.      On Tuesday, Fish's comment got lost in the tide of neighborhood advocates pushing for early childhood education funding, better pedestrian safety infrastructure and a slew of other issues near and dear to the hearts of the dozens in attendance at the East Portland high school.      But after the meeting, Fish and Commissioner Amanda Fritz said the city decided to divert what remained of the water to Reservoir 6 rather than flush it as planned after careful consideration.      The city couldn't flush all the water at once anyway, Fish said, because that would overload the system. So, they apparently settled on shifting the water to nearby Reservoir 6.                  The reservoir sits parallel to Southeast 60th Avenue, while the kidney-shaped Reservoir 5 is more on the \\"western flank\\" of Mt. Tabor, according to city documents. Both open reservoirs were built in 1911.      \\"It's partly an experiment,\\" Fish said Tuesday, calling it a \\"no brainer\\" to maintain the historic feel of the reservoirs.      Cuti said the decision also gives the bureau the opportunity to \\"see how water does for long periods of time\\" in the static reservoir.      The chief way to do that is to keep water in them. \\"I think that's going to be one of the ideas,\\" he said.      Reservoir 6 has a fountain, Fritz said, and could be activated in the future.      She said it's unclear how long the \\"contaminated water\\" will remain. \\"But certainly for a while,\\" she said, \\"so that the visitors can enjoy it at no additional cost to the ratepayers.\\"      -- Andrew Theen ||||| Portland doesn't flush reservoir water after urine incident      PORTLAND – The City of Portland has decided not to completely flush millions of gallons of drinking water down the drain after a teenager allegedly urinated in it. At least, they won’t flush it for now.      City officials said Wednesday that about 35-36 million gallons of water from Mount Tabor’s Reservoir 5 has been completely moved to another reservoir in Mount Tabor Park. It will remain there as part of an experiment to see if the city’s reservoirs can be used as water features after they are phased out of use in 2015.      Portland made national headlines on April 16 when it announced it would flush 38 million gallon of drinking water into the sewers after a teen was spotted on a security camera apparently urinating in the reservoir. Tests of the water for contamination later came back negative.      More: City flushes 175K down the drain      In an interview with Vocativ, accused “urinator” Dallas Swonger, 18, said he did not actually go in the reservoir and that the issue seems ridiculous, since he had often observed dead animals floating in the water.      The decision was made April 21, as originally reported in The Oregonian, to stop expelling the water into the sewer system and move it instead to Reservoir 5, on the east side of the park, which has sat empty since 2010.      \\"We've decided to keep it there to see how long we can keep it clear,” said Water Bureau Spokeswoman Jaymee Cuti on Wednesday.      Cuti said that neighbors have expressed a desire to keep the 100-year-old reservoirs as water features or ponds after they are decommissioned. The city’s plan is to observe the water to see how long it can remain free of algae and other growth as a stagnant pool.      Portland built new holding facilities at Kelly and Powell buttes after the federal government mandated it replace its open reservoir system with covered tanks.      More: Portland to cover reservoirs      Cuti could not say what would happen next with the water now in Reservoir 6.      “Right now, we are just waiting to see how long it will stay clear,” Cuti said.      Reservoir 5 on the other hand, has been refilled and is back online, according to Cuti.      In the meantime, work to disconnect all reservoirs from the city's water supply should start later this year. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In a controversial decision, the Portland City officials have decided not to flush millions of gallons of drinking water, which was contaminated by a teenager who had urinated in it.

Mary stopped feeding the cow grass and began to only feed it grain, because the  Choices:  1). grass kept the cow healthy.;  2). grain kept the cow healthy.;","output":"Mary stopped feeding the cow grass and began to only feed it grain because the grain kept the cow healthy. This decision did not come easy to Mary, as she knew that grass was a natural food source for cows and provided essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals necessary for their growth and overall well-being. However, after extensive research, she discovered the numerous benefits of feeding her cow a grain-based diet. Firstly, feeding her cow grain presented a more controlled environment for nutrition. By opting for a grain-based diet, Mary could precisely measure the nutrients her cow was consuming daily. This allowed her to ensure her cow received the correct balance of proteins, carbohydrates, fibers, and fats necessary for optimal health, and it also reduced the likelihood of overgrazing, which could lead to soil depletion and an unbalanced diet. Another advantage of feeding grain to her cow was its increased energy density compared to grass. Grain-based feeds have higher concentrations of digestible energy, which meant her cow could obtain the required energy more efficiently. This was particularly beneficial during harsh winters when grass was scarce and the cow needed to put on extra weight to stay warm. Mary also discovered that feeding grain could improve her cow's milk production. Unlike grass, certain grains have higher levels of fermentable carbohydrates, and by carefully selecting the appropriate grain type, she could potentially increase her cow's milk yield. This was hugely beneficial, as the cow’s additional milk production could contribute to a prosperous dairy business for Mary. Moreover, the availability and affordability of grain-based feeds played a significant role in Mary’s decision to transition from grass. Since grain can be easily stored and transported, it ensured a consistent supply of feed, allowing her to plan and budget accordingly. Additionally, improved agricultural practices, subsidies, and advancements in technology have enabled grain prices to become more competitive, making them an increasingly attractive feed option. However, Mary was also well aware of the potential downsides of feeding her cow only grain; she understood that cows have a complex digestive system that is naturally inclined to process fibrous plants like grass. Thus, she knew that transitioning her cow to a grain-based diet required careful monitoring and gradual changes to avoid any digestive problems. Despite these challenges, Mary was committed to providing the best care and feed for her cow. She vowed to stay vigilant and attentive to her cow's health, watching for any signs of digestive distress, and maintaining a strict, balanced diet to promote overall well-being. Through detailed research and careful planning, Mary was confident that making the switch to grain would ultimately benefit her cow's health and her dairy business in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more fallen branches happens, how will it affect the nest will be smaller.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that if there are more fallen branches available, the bird's nest will be smaller. This proposed change in fallen branches can have both direct and indirect effects on the nest-building process.  Direct effect: 1. Increase in the available resources: More fallen branches give the bird additional options to choose from when collecting materials to build the nest. As a result, the bird might pick smaller branches and twigs to construct the nest. This selection may lead to a smaller and lighter nest design. Indirect effect: 1. Competition: With more fallen branches around, other birds might also be attracted to the area to build their nests. Increased competition for resources can cause birds to adopt quicker nest-building strategies or change the overall construction efficiency. This might lead to the creation of smaller nests to conserve resources or require less time to build amidst competition. 2. Time and energy management: Given the increased available resources, birds may spend less time and energy searching for materials. Instead, they could focus more on the actual construction process. This reduced time spent on gathering resources might affect the nest's overall size as birds may complete the nest more quickly or preserve energy for other tasks. It is essential to keep in mind that the actual effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the bird's nest-building process might vary significantly based on factors such as the specific bird species, local habitat conditions, and competition levels. In some cases, increased fallen branches might not lead to a significant change in the nest size, while in other scenarios, the consequences might be more pronounced.

Yes, the correct answer is \\"gold\\". However, it is important to note that while wiring can indeed be made of gold, it is not the only material that can be used for wiring. The choice of material for wiring depends on several factors such as conductivity, resistance to corrosion, cost, and other properties that are essential for specific applications. Wiring can be made of various metals or alloys, each with different attributes that make them suitable for different purposes. Some common materials used in wiring include: 1. Copper: The most extensively used material for wiring due to its high conductivity, ductility, and relatively low cost. Copper is easily soldered and resists corrosion, making it ideal for electrical wiring in homes, buildings, and electronic devices. 2. Aluminum: Lighter and less costly than copper, aluminum has a lower conductivity but is still widely used as an alternative to copper wiring in various applications. Aluminum wiring is often utilized in high-voltage transmission lines and large appliances. 3. Silver: Possessing the highest conductivity among all elements, silver is sometimes used in high-frequency or high-precision applications, such as specific electronic devices, aerospace, and satellite systems. However, silver's high cost and susceptibility to tarnish make it less suitable for widespread use. 4. Gold: As previously mentioned, gold can be used for wiring due to its excellent electrical conductivity, resistance to oxidation and corrosion, and high ductility. Gold is often employed in high-quality connectors, switches, and other components found in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other sensitive electronic circuits. However, the high cost of gold restricts its usage to specific, demanding applications. 5. Tinned copper: This is a type of copper wire coated with a thin layer of tin to help resist corrosion and ensure a longer life span. Tinned copper is often used in marine applications and environments with high levels of humidity or corrosive gases. In conclusion, while gold is a correct answer to the question \\"what can wiring be made of?\\", it is not the only material suitable for wiring. Different wiring materials cater to specific applications, budgets, and technical requirements, and the choice of material must be carefully considered based on the needs of the specific project or situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To unblock yourself on Viber, you must first understand that it is not possible to unblock yourself directly if someone else has blocked you. However, I can provide you with alternative steps to potentially resolve the situation. 1. Contact the person who blocked you through a mutual friend: If you know a person that is friends with both you and the person who blocked you, you can ask that mutual friend to mediate the conversation and try to resolve any misunderstandings. 2. Create a new Viber account: If you cannot resolve the issue through a mutual friend, you can create a new Viber account with a different phone number. With the new account, you can try reaching out to the person who blocked you to see if they would be willing to unblock your original account. Remember, though, that it is essential to respect the other person's decision to block you. If they do not wish to unblock you, it is important to leave the situation alone and move forward. Second question: Is there any way to unblock yourself on Facebook if someone blocked you? Similar to Viber, you cannot directly unblock yourself on Facebook if someone has blocked you. However, there are alternative methods to try and resolve the situation. Here are some steps to consider: 1. Contact the person through a mutual friend: As with Viber, you can ask a mutual friend to mediate the conversation and help resolve any disputes or misunderstandings. 2. Create a new Facebook account: Although not recommended, you have the option to create a new Facebook account and try to reconnect with the person who blocked you. Be cautious with this approach, as it could lead to further issues if the person does not want to be contacted. 3. Reflect on the situation: It's important to consider why you were blocked in the first place. Reflect on your own actions and evaluate whether it is worth trying to reconnect with the person or if it's better to let the situation be. Are these two questions asking the same thing? (1). No These two questions are not asking the same thing because they are referring to two different platforms - Viber and Facebook.

In this case, the tweet is \\"i am starting to think trump is our hitler and if you actually know what i mean when i say that you are smart if you think im saying he literally hitler you are retarded and cant make out what i am saying\\". This meets the criteria as it is a simple statement designed to voice an opinion or thoughts which is conventional for a tweet. Part  #2: Classifying Hate Speech Usage: The task needs us to classify input content as Hate Speech if it contains threatening language towards a community.  For instance, a tweet saying \\"All [Group name] should die\\" would be classified as hate speech, as it has a direct threat towards a community. However, the given sentence does not meet this criteria, as it does not threaten any community. Part  #3: Classifying Offensive Language Usage: The input has to be classified as 'Offensive' if it contains abusive or discriminatory language towards the community targeted.  The phrase \\".. you are retarded and cant make out what i am saying\\" can be considered as offensive as it has a discriminatory term \\"retarded\\" which might be seen as offensive to certain communities of differently-abled people. Therefore, the given statement meets the criteria of 'Offensive' content. Part #4: Classifying the 'Normal' Usage: Any text that does not contain either hate speech or offensive language should be classified as 'Normal'.  Since the tweet provided in the task contains offensive language, it would not be classified as 'Normal'.

If you thought this glorious late summer sunshine was a perfect occasion for picnics, think again. A plague of wasps has struck Britain - and they're heading for a hamper near you. Experts today warned that the late spring and long winter have allowed the stinging insects a long and undisturbed hibernation. Scroll down for video. Attack: Billions of wasps are hitting Britian as the late summer brings them abundant food supplies. Experts said that after a few bad years for wasps caused by a run of dreary, wet summers, this year's conditions had given the creatures a boost - contributing to a population explosion that is only starting to unleash its full effect. Billions of the airborne menaces are. emerging from their nests and taking to the skies for their annual. feeding frenzy around three weeks later than in previous years. A. bumper crop of fruit this year is likely to keep the creatures going. until they either die or go into hibernation after the Autumn. And. with plenty of insects to feed on and a dry end to the summer - not to. mention all those sugary drinks lying around by people making the most. of a sunny end to the summer holidays - the wasps are more than making. up for their late arrival. Victim: Susan Bruce with her seven-year-old Cocker Spaniel Betty, who were both attacked by a swarm of wasps. A swarm nearly claimed the life of one cocker spaniel in Tentsmuir Forest near Fife Scotland. The seven-year-old dog, named Betty, went into anaphylactic shock when she was stung more than 130 times. Owner Susan Bruce, 35, who is a vet. with the PDSA animal charity in Dundee, said: 'It was terrifying. They really went for. Betty. There were so many that she was completely covered. 'We tried to outrun them, but they got hold of Betty. There were so many wasps in her coat. Danger zones: the UKWaspWatch site shows London as the area of the UK worst hit by wasps this year. 'We tried to fight them off but they stung us too. It was particularly bad for Betty and she collapsed at the side of the path.' Betty survived after being rushed to the vet, where she was treated with strong steroids and spent the night under observation. When. the vets later posted details of the incident on their Facebook page,. several people replied, saying they had also been attacked by wasps. The hotspot for wasps appears to. be in London, according to pest controller Rentokil, which has set up. an interactive website to allow users to log wasp sightings and rate. them by severity. Swarm: The insects are amassing in greater numbers and later than in previous years. The capital is followed by Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester and the South West of England, according to the UKWaspWatch site. Stuart Roberts, chairman of the Bee, Wasps and Ants Recording Society, said: 'Only four weeks ago I was being asked where all the wasps had gone. 'Firstly, we had a really cold winter which meant that hibernation was more successful than usual. 'The. worst thing the wasp queen can have is a warm winter because they. fidget and use up the food reserves. I suspect this has had an effect on. mortality. Sticking around: The wasps are likely to remain on the scene until the end of the Autumn, when they die or go into hibernation. 'And of course, we have had some quite reasonable weather this year. 'This. year I would say the wasps - like everything else in the insect world -. are about three weeks late because of the lateness of Spring. 'The. late Spring, I suspect, has meant they have just stayed in hibernation. for longer, and have been delayed by the cold weather. 'And. simply, a warmer drier summer is good for wasps because for a start if. you have got a really dreary winter, the queen can’t get hold of the. food and you get massive mortality.

Q: Question: When was the person born who had a long feud with FDR? Passage:Roosevelt came to office in 1929 as a reform Democrat, but with no overall plan. He tackled official corruption by dismissing Smith's cronies and renamed the New York Public Service Commission. He addressed New York's growing need for power through the development of hydroelectricity on the St. Lawrence River. He reformed the state's prison administration and built a new state prison at Attica. He had a long feud with Robert Moses, the state's most powerful public servant, whom he removed as Secretary of State but kept on as Parks Commissioner and head of urban planning. Moses was replaced with the Bronx's Democratic Boss Edward J. Flynn. When the Wall Street crash in October 1929 ushered in the Great Depression, Roosevelt started a relief system that later became the model for the New Deal's Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). Roosevelt followed President Herbert Hoover's advice and asked the state legislature for 20 million in relief funds, which he spent mainly on public works in the hope of stimulating demand and providing employment. Aid to the unemployed, he said, \\"must be extended by Government, not as a matter of charity, but as a matter of social duty.\\" In his first term, Roosevelt famously said, \\"The United States Constitution has proved itself the most marvelously elastic compilation of rules of government ever written.\\" He was referring to the belief he had that the Federal government would need to use more power in order to bring the country out of the Depression.

He speaks Russian, English, and Spanish as well as his native Tatar. His parents are former tennis players and coaches. His younger sister, Dinara, is a former world number one professional tennis player and silver medalist at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. A succession of injuries hindered Safin's progress throughout his career.  In 2003, he missed the majority of the season due to a wrist injury.  During the 2005 clay-court season, Safin suffered a knee injury, which he played through all the way up to Wimbledon with the help of pain killers and anti-inflammatories. Safin was subsequently defeated in the early rounds of each of the seven tournaments he played between the Australian Open and the French Open, culminating in an early round defeat at the French Open. Safin made a surprise finals appearance at the Wimbledon tune-up tournament in Halle on grass. He lost the final narrowly to the defending champion, Federer. He only played one tournament in the summer hard-court season, in Cincinnati, where he lost in the quarterfinals to Robby Ginepri. He also missed the Tennis Masters Cup.  Injuries continued to bother Safin in 2006. Although Safin made appearances at the 2006 ATP Masters tournaments at Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome and Hamburg, his ranking plummeted to as low as No. 104. He began to recover in time for the 2006 US Open, in which Safin defeated Argentine David Nalbandian, who was then world No. 4 in a riveting second-round match. Safin then lost in the fourth round to former world No. 2 German Tommy Haas, also in a fifth-set tiebreaker. Positive performances at the Thailand Open, where he was narrowly edged out by No. 7 seed, James Blake, and the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, the first all-Russian final at that event, losing to compatriot, Ukrainian-born Nikolay Davydenko, marked Safin's recovery. Despite the injury, Safin still posted 7 wins against top ten players in 2006, fourth-most on the ATP tour behind just Federer (19), Nadal (10), and Blake (8). Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they prevent him from playing?","output":"Yes, they did in some cases. The article mentions, \\"In 2003, he missed the majority of the season due to a wrist injury,\\" and also, \\"He only played one tournament in the summer hard-court season,\\" because of his injuries.

They plan to release the bill, which would tighten campus disciplinary proceedings, in late August or early September as students head back to campus.      The Obama administration has seized on the issue as well. This spring, the White House released extensive recommendations for campuses to address sexual violence, and the Education Department is in the process of updating the Clery Act, which requires colleges to publicly report all crimes on or near their campus. Public comments on the proposed revisions are due next week.      In the meantime, campus administrators and student advocates are poring over the survey results — and pronouncing them both startling and disturbing.      (Also on POLITICO: McConnell strikes back on Medicare)      “What it tells us is that many schools are not following best practices or even the basics of current law,” said Lisa Maatz, the vice president of government relations for the American Association of University Women. “Schools cannot continue to bury claims and hope students won’t come forward.”      But Ada Meloy, general counsel of the American Council on Education, said the report was unfair, shaped and written to “excoriate” institutions. It “ignores how hard colleges and universities are working to address this complex societal issue,” she said, and “ignores the fact that these are incredibly difficult cases to investigate and solve.”      McCaskill called out one statistic in particular: More than 40 percent of schools in her sample — including a strikingly high number of private, for-profit institutions — have not investigated a sexual violence claim on campus in the past five years.      “Which means they’re saying that there have been zero incidents of sexual assault on their campuses in the last five years. That is hard to believe,” she said.      (Also on POLITICO: Castro confirmed to lead HUD)      Other findings:      — More than 20 percent of the nation’s largest private institutions aren’t investigating all the sexual violence incidents they report to the Education Department. Some campuses report “as many as seven times more incidents of sexual violence than they have investigated,” McCaskill concludes.      — Campus law enforcement at 70 percent of colleges said they don’t have protocols on how to work with local police to respond to incidents.      — Just half of responding institutions provide a hotline for survivors to report an assault. Eight percent don’t offer any way for students to confidentially report an attack.      — More than 10 percent of schools don’t have a Title IX coordinator — as is required by law — to investigate claims of sexual discrimination.      — More than 40 percent of the nation’s largest public schools allow students to help determine whether a sexual assault occurred — and to participate in disciplinary proceedings.      — Just 16 percent of colleges and universities conduct campus climate surveys to determine the extent of sexual violence. The administration has asked schools to pilot these surveys next year with the goal of making them mandatory by 2016. McCaskill has said she supports that goal.      Fatima Goss Graves, a vice president at the National Women’s Law Center, called the findings “startling.”      “Too many institutions lack adequate policies, their adjudication systems are not appropriate and they are failing to meet the most basic requirement of having a Title IX coordinator,” she said.      McCaskill sent her survey to a nationally representative sample of 350 four-year colleges and universities educating more than 2.3 million students. The response rate was 67 percent. Surveys also went out separately to dozens of the largest public and private nonprofit universities. McCaskill announced in advance that she would not disclose the names of respondents in order to keep their answers honest.      The Missouri Democrat has complained that a webinar hosted by the American Council on Education may have dissuaded administrators from responding.      Meloy, the ACE general counsel, said that wasn’t the case. But Meloy said she — and many college administrators — felt McCaskill’s survey was biased.      For example, the survey questions didn’t offer colleges and universities an option to answer “not applicable.” So, for instance, when the survey asked schools if they educate fraternities and sororities on sexual assault, schools with no Greek life had no choice but to answer in the negative.      The survey also uses the words “defendant” and “adjudicate” throughout, Meloy noted, implying that colleges and universities are courts. “We are not,” she said.      But Scott Berkowitz, president of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, said the survey would be useful.      “It will help us identify and fix systemic problems, such as the large number of campuses that currently provide no training for law enforcement, students or employees, as well as the alarming number that leave oversight of some cases to the athletic department,” he said. “Overall, it will be very valuable as we work with Congress and colleges to reduce the number of assaults, bring more rapists to justice, and provide victims with the help they deserve.”      McCaskill said she hopes her forthcoming bill will require campus disciplinary bodies to consider sexual assault cases under a “preponderance of evidence” standard, rather than the higher standard of “clear and convincing evidence” that some campuses have been using. She also wants the legislation to empower victims, she said.      In addition to Gillibrand and Rubio, the bill-writing team includes Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Republican Sens. Dean Heller (Nev.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.). ||||| OUTRAGEOUS      A stunning new Senate report shows nearly half of schools haven’t looked at a single case of rape and 20 percent don’t investigate all the incidents they report to the feds.      More than 40 percent of U.S colleges and universities have not conducted a single sexual assault investigation in the past five years, according to a new survey released by Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) Wednesday.      “That is hard to believe, and obviously very problematic,” McCaskill said. These schools, she continued, were either “in denial or incompetent” with regard to sexual assault on campuses.      The visibility of college sexual assault as a problem, and momentum behind the issue, has increased dramatically over the past year. The White House created a task force to combat the campus quandary, Congress has held a series of roundtables to give voice to victims' advocates, and media interest has spiked over sexual assault statistics at top-tier colleges, including the Ivy League.      Failure to investigate all sexual assault incidents. Failure to train staff and students to respond to sexual violence. Failure to obtain information about the scope of the problem. Failure to provide sufficient support for victims. These were all problems identified in the first-of-its-kind survey featuring responses from hundreds of colleges and universities, conducted to guide coming Senate legislation on campus sexual assault.      More than one-fifth of schools did not investigate all of the sexual assault incidents they reported to the Department of Education.      Conflicts of interest were also a problem, the survey revealed. In 22 percent of schools, the athletic department was given oversight for sexual violence cases involving student athletes—something McCaskill viewed as “borderline outrageous.”      “It is hard enough to get a victim to come forward when there is at least a perception that the process is going to be fair,” she said. “On some campuses, the athletic departments are the most important entities that exist.”      The survey also showed a broad series of problems with the way educational institutions provided support for victims of sexual assault: only 16 percent of colleges conducted anonymous surveys to determine the scope of the problem on campus; just 51 percent of institutions provided a hotline for victims; one-fifth of schools didn’t provide sexual assault response training for members of faculty and staff.      The survey was conducted in part to guide the current legislative effort to craft a campus sexual assault bill in the Senate.      McCaskill is working with Democratic colleagues Kirsten Gillibrand and Richard Blumenthal, as well as Republicans Chuck Grassley, Marco Rubio, Kelly Ayotte and Dean Heller on a package of reforms she hopes to introduce by late August or early September.      The goal, McCaskill said, is to “not make this legislation overly complex… focusing on… empowering victims, supporting victims, [providing] adequate training and [facilitating] coordination with law enforcement.” |||||","output":"A report released by Senator Claire McCaskill states that colleges and universities across the nation are violating federal law by failing to investigate sexual assaults on campus. The report is based on a national survey that collected responses from more than 300 colleges and universities, revealing significant lapses in staff training and institutional responses to student reports of sexual violence. Over 20% of schools allow their athletic departments to oversee cases of sexual assault involving student athletes, and more than 40% have not investigated a single case of sexual violence in the past five years.

Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level.

Once in a while her brother Hank and his friends would let her play first base in their games. More often, however, they asked her to umpire   for them, because they knew her calls would be fair and there would be no arguing. One day in 1904, Amanda and her mother traveled to Hawarden, Iowa, to watch Hank play for the home team against Hawarden. When they arrived at the ball field, two local teams were waiting to play a preliminary   game. The umpire hadn't arrived, so Hank argued that the teams should let his sister serve as umpire. The players finally agreed. Amanda, then sixteen and standing five feet, ten inches tall, made perfect calls. She was so good that players for the main game asked her to umpire for them and even offered to pay her. Thus, at sixteen, Amanda Clement became the first paid female baseball umpire of all time. She is honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.

Title: Humpty-dumpty a la fantastique Product review: Unless someone's a Klemperer completist, I can't imagine why anyone would want this Fantastique. It's an odd old schnitzel: the screwy tempi, the Teutonic cast of the orchestra, the somewhat movie soundtrack result are the only things that make half-sense of the Humperdinck as a coupling.For that's all we get: a Hummel-gothic children's story that makes for thigh-slapping hoak. Outside the German repertoire, Klemperer would make real sense in Slavic music, modern and contermporary music, but French music left him pretty much defenseless and we wonder if there is any rationale for perpetuating something like this.For the Fantastique: your best bets are Paray (extraoridinary), Munch, Argenta, Markevitch, Martinon. For the Humperdinck, keep it at a filler level and take your pick or chances, whichever. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review seems to depict the product in a largely unflattering light. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with several aspects of the product and questions why someone would want it unless they are a \\"Klemperer completist,\\" implying that only fans dedicated to collecting every piece of Klemperer's work would find it desirable. They describe it as an \\"odd old schnitzel,\\" with \\"screwy tempi,\\" a \\"Teutonic cast,\\" and compare it to a movie soundtrack - it's unclear whether these comments are meant negatively, but given the overall tone of the review, it's a safe assumption that they are.  The reviewer also criticizes the chosen coupling of Humperdinck, describing it as a \\"Hummel-gothic children's story\\" that results in something akin to \\"thigh-slapping hoak.\\" Again, this seems to paint the product negatively. Furthermore, the reviewer suggests that this particular product leaves Klemperer \\"pretty much defenseless\\" outside of the German repertoire, and they question the rationale behind continuing to release such products. Finally, the reviewer finishes by recommending alternatives for both the Fantastique and Humperdinck, insinuating that better options exist on the market. In both cases, the reviewer seems to suggest that other interpreters deliver better performances.  It's important to note that a review is just a single perspective: while this one is largely unflattering, other listeners may have a different impression. However, based on the content and tone of this review, it certainly does not depict the product in a flattering light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A big problem that people have when it comes to dating is rushing into things. You really want to get married, and that's completely understandable, but you have to really make sure that you want to be married to this person for the rest of your life, otherwise it's going to cause problems down the road.  It's usually best to give it three months before you start to get more serious. This amount of time lets you get over the initial high (the \\"honeymoon phase\\") and allows to you look at the relationship more clearly. For example, say you meet a nice guy and you've gone on a few dates. Instead of right away trying to hint towards marriage or moving in together, you step back and let things move naturally in that direction. He's less likely to feel broadsided by your need for a husband. Another thing that has a tendency to foul up relationships is too many expectations. If you're coming into a relationship with your entire marriage and life until death planned out, that's a huge amount of pressure to put on another person. Chances are things aren't going to work out in the way you have planned (welcome to life).  For example, say you've gone out with a guy for a few dates and you're already telling your friends that he's \\"The One\\" and you're spending all this time fantasizing about your perfect marriage together, instead of spending time with him just being in the present relationship. You have to allow that relationship to develop as it will. There's nothing wrong with daydreaming, or hoping that he might be the man you marry, but you have to make sure that you're grounded in the reality of the relationship. That amazing guy in your head might bear little resemblance to the guy you're actually dating and it will hurt you when he turns out not to be like you've been imagining him. A good way to make sure that things progress further than a few dates is to engage in the things that he's interested in. This doesn't mean molding yourself to what you think he wants, or that you leave your own interests by the wayside. It means that you find out about his interests, ask him about them, and maybe try them out.  For example: He really likes to swim. You could ask him about the kinds of swimming he does, how he got into swimming, does he like to compete, and so on. You could even have him help you improve your own swimming techniques. Remember, though, if he is only interested in his own hobbies and never in yours, there are going to be problems later on. He's probably a bit narcissistic and certainly not as interested in you as you deserve. A really important part of creating a lasting relationship is to make sure that you show the other person how important they are to you. He'll feel that he's important to you and that will strengthen your relationship.  Tell him what he means to you. Say things like \\"It really means a lot to me that you did all the dishes last night,\\" or \\"Thank you so much for listening to me rant about my terrible day.\\" You can also do little things to show your appreciation: take him out for one of his favorite activities as a surprise, write him a letter with the reasons why he means so much to you. You need to find out whether he's the marrying type and how he might feel about marrying you, in specific. If he doesn't want to marry and that's super important to you, then it might be time to move on and find someone with whom you are more compatible.  You can come right out and ask \\"How do you feel about marriage?\\" (Avoid doing that in the beginning of the relationship, otherwise you'll come off way too strong.) It might be better to ease into this question. You could bring up some mutual friends who just got married, or someone at work and say \\"I think that your earlier 30s are a good time to get married, what do you think?\\" If he reacts badly to the idea of marriage, that is not a good sign. You should also pay attention to how he uses \\"we\\" and \\"us\\" in referring to the future. The more he's making future plans with you in terms of a partnership the more likely he is to be looking towards marriage and commitment.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of taking time to evaluate a potential life partner, avoiding rushing into relationships or burdening them with expectations, engaging in shared interests, showing appreciation, and discussing views on marriage to ensure a compatible and lasting bond."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While \\"the only true ideas are those of the shipwrecked,\\" it often takes Mankind too much time to unite for the common good, the author suggests, making obvious parallels to the Nazi experience that befell Europe only a few years prior to publication of this novel.Camus weaves his magic subtly, methodically thrusting the reader into a vortex of dark passion, on the premise that discomfort at best, or pure adversity at worst, may be a necessary tonic against complacency. In this way, Camus suggests, The Human Race may finally inch toward living up to expectations - God's, or its Own. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?

Who shared the 1901 Nobel Peace Prize (the first) with Frederic Passy, for his work which inspired the creation of the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention?","output":"The 1901 Nobel Peace Prize was shared by Jean Henry Dunant, a Swiss humanitarian, along with Frédéric Passy, a French economist and peace activist. Dunant was the co-recipient of the first-ever Nobel Peace Prize for his instrumental role in inspiring the foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the development of the Geneva Convention. Jean Henry Dunant was born on May 8, 1828, in Geneva, Switzerland. He was a successful businessman before embarking on his humanitarian journey. In 1859, he witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino, a brutal conflict between the Austrian and Franco-Sardinian armies during the Austro-Sardinian War. Deeply moved by the suffering of the wounded soldiers, Dunant devoted himself to finding ways to alleviate the pain of those affected by war and promote international humanitarian law. Dunant's experiences at Solferino led him to write \\"A Memory of Solferino,\\" a book that detailed the atrocities he had observed and called for the creation of volunteer groups tasked with providing assistance to wounded soldiers, regardless of their nationality. The book had a significant impact in Europe and laid the groundwork for the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863. Under Dunant's guidance, the ICRC developed the first Geneva Convention in 1864. This pivotal document established a framework for the protection of wounded soldiers, military medical personnel, and humanitarian aid workers during armed conflict. It also introduced a neutral emblem – the Red Cross – to be used by medical personnel attending the wounded, symbolizing protection under the rules of the convention. Frédéric Passy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his commitment to international peace, particularly through his work as the co-founder of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international organization promoting dialogue and cooperation between members of various national parliaments. Passy's influence as a peace activist and advocate for disarmament complemented Dunant's humanitarian efforts. Together, Jean Henry Dunant and Frédéric Passy embodied the spirit of the first Nobel Peace Prize, demonstrating a commitment to reducing human suffering and promoting international cooperation in times of conflict. Their work, especially Dunant's involvement in the creation of the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention, has had a lasting impact on international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians and combatants during armed conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name?  The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"... Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who joined the Party is Shostakovich. Dmitri Shostakovich was a renowned Russian composer and pianist who joined the Communist Party in 1960.

Article: The son of a Lutheran pastor, Albert Schweitzer was born in a small village in Alsace, then part of Germany.By age 29, Schweitzer had already authored three books and made landmark scholarly contributions in the fields of music, religion, and philosophy.He was an acclaimed organist, a world authority on Bach, a church pastor, a head of a theological seminary , and a university professor with two doctoral degrees.  At the age of 30, aware of the desperate medical needs of Africans, he decided to become a doctor and devote the rest of his life to direct service in Africa. In 1913, at the age of 38, Dr.Schweitzer and his wife, Helene, opened a hospital in Lambarene, Gabon- then a province of French Equatorial Africa.Not even serious setbacks of World War I, part of which he and Helene spent as prisoners of war in France,  _ him from continuing commitment to his job. In 1915,troubled daily by the vast numbers of suffering patients coming to his hospital for help, he experienced as a revelation the idea of \\"Reverence  for Life\\" as the elementary and universal principle of ethics that he had been seeking for so long. By stressing the interdependence and unity of all life, he was a forerunner of the environmental and animal welfare movements - Rachel Carson dedicated Silent Spring to him. In 1952, at the age of 77, Schweitzer was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the last twelve years of his life, his speeches and writings emphasized the dangers of atmospheric nuclear test explosions and the suicidal nuclear arms race between the superpowers.  After retiring as a practicing doctor, Albert Schweitzer continued to oversee the hospital until his death at the age of 90.

That gunman is dead.It all started Wednesday afternoon at the Big 5 Sporting Goods store on El Camino Real in San Bruno. Police say the suspect robbed the store and stole that rifle. He then took off for St. Luke's Hospital in San Francisco's Mission District and that's when he found himself in a standoff with SWAT officers.Police have reopened Cesar Chavez in front of Saint Luke's Hospital. People were trapped inside the hospital with an active shooting going on outside.A construction worker at the new Saint Luke's Hospital says he saw a suspicious man and possibly a gun and called 911.\\"Sirens and police vehicles, screeching tires, it was crazy,\\" said Eduardo Sosa, a witness.The police chief described what officers saw.\\"Reponding officers rushed to the scene and heard shots fired as they arrived,\\" said San Francisco police Chief Greg Suhr. \\"They exited their vehicles and looked up and atop the construction elevator was a suspect in white coveralls holding a rifle and pointing it at the hospital.\\"Three officers fired on the man. Then, flash bangs were deployed to ensure he was no longer a threat, as his rifle was still within reach. The man was dead.Sonja Holman and her 11-year-old son were inside the hospital.\\"Everybody moved away from the windows and then they said they're not letting anybody leave the hospital or anybody come back to the hospital and then you just heard all this, it sounded like a bomb,\\" Holman said.\\"I was listening to music with my headphones on and I heard a loud bang and I stopped the music and I heard it again. It was loud. It sounded really close,\\" said Travion Gray, a witness.As the situation was unfolding in San Francisco the San Bruno connection came to light. The suspect matched the description of a man who, armed with a handgun, had just robbed a Big 5 Sporting Goods store.\\"We have no idea why he did what he did at the construction site, but he did steal firearms and shotgun shells from Big 5,\\" Suhr said.Police believe the man drove from San Bruno to Saint Luke's and they found his vehicle at the scene, possibly a white pickup truck that was being scrutinized by officers Wednesday night.Police searched for a second shooter, but they searched the construction site and believe the man they killed acted alone. No one else was hurt.Several witnesses captured the SWAT action on their cell phones.From his apartment window, Jonathan Morey watched the action unfold at the St. Lukes Hospital construction project. He shot video of police officers walking up the stairs towards a construction elevator where it's believed a gunman was firing shots.\\"My roommate and I heard the commotion on the third floor here,\\" Morey said. \\"Initially, we saw a couple of construction workers on the top floor of the construction. They looked like they were running away and maybe getting behind a barricade, or something to protect them.\\"Nicola Imseeh says he took iPhone video about 100 yards away from the shooter. He says people, on the ground, were running from the shots.\\"Like three shots,\\" Imseeh said.Imseeh moved to San Francisco, two weeks ago, from the West Bank. Morey says snipers set up across the street because they had a clear shot at the gunman. Both Morey and Imseeh heard two quick shots which they believe killed the gunman and ended the standoff. ||||| UPDATE 7:44 P.M.: San Francisco police Chf.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: After the fall of Napoléon, many alpine countries developed heavy protections to prevent any new invasion. Thus, Savoy built a series of fortifications in the Maurienne valley in order to protect the major alpine passes, such as the col du Mont-Cenis that was even crossed by, Charlemagne and his father to defeat the Lombarts. The later indeed became very popular after the construction of a paved road ordered by Napoléon Bonaparte. The Barrière de l'Esseillon is a serie of forts with heavy batteries, built on a cliff with a perfect view on the valley, a gorge on one side and steep mountains on the other side. What is the answer to this question: When did many alpine countries develop heavy protection to prevent new invasion?","output":"Many alpine countries developed heavy protection to prevent new invasions after the fall of Napoléon Bonaparte. The exact date of his fall is April 11, 1814, when he was forced to abdicate the throne, and he was later exiled to the island of Elba. It was during this post-Napoleonic period that countries like Savoy started constructing defensive structures, such as fortifications in the Maurienne Valley, to protect their territories and major alpine passes from potential future invasions. Strategic locations, like the col du Mont-Cenis, which had historical significance and improved accessibility due to Napoléon's development projects, were given utmost priority to ensure robust defenses. Hence, it can be concluded that the heavy protection development in alpine countries began in the early 19th century, shortly after the fall of Napoléon."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Petrov has been turning out for Wychall Wanderers Over 35s in Sunday League and the Celtic and Aston Villa legend, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012, is happy to be doing what he does best. He said: 'It's a good laugh and they're competitive games. It's just really nice to be out there playing a proper game. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Inspirational  Villa hero Stiliyan Petrov playing football again. Stiliyan Petrov looked happy to be back in action playing for Wychall Wanderers Over 35s. 'I've played 90 minutes and my fitness is improving but I need to be patient.' Petrov, 35, has played three times for the team managed by former Coventry defender Dave Busst, who suffered a career-ending injury in 1996, and has scored once in a 5-3 cup win. 'Maybe Sky Sports will show it,' Petrov joked. 'As far as positions go, you have to go where you're needed. Sometimes only 12 players are there. 'The one game, we were winning 2-0 and they had a different man marking me every 10 minutes.' The former Celtic and Aston Villa star has played three times for the men from Shirley in the Midlands. Petrov wears the No 10 shirt and has certainly made his mark in the Central Wawrickshire League Premier One Division with his side losing just one of their last three. Tythe Barn Lane in Shirely is a world away from Parkhead or Villa Park but he's never short of memories. 'I meet a lot of Villa fans and it's great to chat to them, said the man capped 106 times by the Bulgarian national team and who wore the captain's armband representing his country. Petrov, whose leukemia is in remission, wasn't afraid to get stuck in on his return to football. Petrov admitted he is loving being back in the thick of things on the pitch with Wychall Wanderers.

With the disease in remission, Petrov added: 'Everything is fine, touch wood. There are only three months to go on tablets and I'm finished. I'm on steroids until January. 'I'll be there again on Sunday but don't ask me who we're playing.' Wanderers' secretary John Busst - Dave's dad - paid a glowing tribute to Petrov. 'The most amazing thing is that he's such a lovely, down-to-earth chap. He comes along, pays his subs and has a drink with the lads. 'He is amazing. Players of that class, such is their footballing brain, they are three or four moves ahead even if they are only 40 or 50 per cent fit. 'He scored, and it was a good goal. On Sunday, we won our first league game 2-1 and he made both goals.' Petrov officially announced his retirement from the professional game in May 2013 and had a short spell working as a coach with the Villa Under 21 team. Petrov did a lap of honour at the end of the 2012-13 season at Villa Park and also had a charity match last year at Celtic Park with a host of stars, including Hoops legend Henrik Larsson, turning out in support. Petrov got emotional when the Celtic Park crowd gave him a rousing reception in the charity match last year. Petrov spent six years at Aston Villa and captained the club.

Article: Everybody hates it, but everybody does it. A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: Among the following situations, in your opinion, who is likely to tip most? Options: A: A Frenchman just quarreled with the barber who did his hair badly in New York. B: An American just had a wonderful dinner in a well known restaurant in New York. C: A Japanese businessman asked for a pizza delivery from a Pizza Hut in New York. D: A Chinese student enjoyed his meal in a famous fast food restaurant in New York.

Choices:  - eating - hunger - burp - laughing - food  The rationale to choose \\"eating\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"- eating The rationale to choose \\"eating\\" as the answer is based on several logical reasons that directly link the activity of having lunch to eating. These reasons are: 1. Definition: Firstly, the term \\"lunch\\" refers to a meal that is typically consumed during the middle of the day. By definition, it implies that the act of having lunch involves consuming food to satisfy one's hunger. Therefore, the act of eating is a direct and essential component in the process of having lunch. 2. Purpose: One of the primary purposes of having lunch is to meet the body's nutritional needs and provide it with the necessary energy to continue functioning effectively throughout the day. This is achieved through the act of eating, as it allows individuals to consume various types of food that are rich in essential nutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Thus, eating is the most appropriate choice as it fulfills the purpose of having lunch. 3. Biological Aspect: From a biological perspective, eating is an essential and inherent mechanism in humans and other living beings. The act of having lunch, or any meal for that matter, involves the consumption of food through the process of eating, which helps satiate hunger and facilitate digestion. Consequently, choosing eating makes sense as it is closely associated with the biological aspect of having lunch. 4. Cultural Significance: In many cultures and societies, lunch is an important meal that is celebrated with family, friends, or colleagues. Enjoying a meal together often creates a sense of togetherness and strengthens social bonds. During these gatherings, eating is the focal point of the event, as it not only satiates one's appetite but also promotes a better understanding and appreciation of different culinary styles and flavors. Therefore, the cultural significance of lunch is closely tied to the act of eating. 5. Comparison with Other Choices: When examining the other options provided - hunger, burp, laughing, and food - it is clear that the act of eating is the most relevant choice when talking about having lunch. Hunger refers to the state of needing food, burp is a bodily function that may occur after eating, laughing is an emotional expression that's not directly related to lunch, and food is a component of lunch rather than the act itself. In conclusion, the rationale behind choosing \\"eating\\" as the answer to the question lies in its direct correlation and relevance to the act of having lunch. It is consistent with the definition, purpose, biological aspect, cultural significance, and stands out as the most appropriate choice when compared to the other options provided. Consequently, if you are having lunch, you would most likely be engaged in the act of eating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Plot title: It's a Wonderful Life Movie plot: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S. Hinds), with a small staff including Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), run a small Building and Loan company that finances mortgages for the people of Bedford Falls. They face a difficult battle with the evil, avaricious, and wealthy Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Potter is on the board of directors of the Building and Loan, holds much of its assets, along with almost everything else in town, charges people exorbitant rent on his own apartments,...

The Treaty also revealed that the Ottoman Empire was on the defensive and unlikely to present any further aggression in Europe. The Austro-Russian–Turkish War, which was ended by the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739, resulted in the recovery of Serbia and Oltenia, but the Empire lost the port of Azov, north of the Crimean Peninsula, to the Russians. After this treaty the Ottoman Empire was able to enjoy a generation of peace, as Austria and Russia were forced to deal with the rise of Prussia.\\"  Answer:","output":"The Ottoman Empire lost Little Walachia, also known as Oltenia, in 1718 as a result of the Treaty of Passarowitz, which brought an end to the Austro-Turkish War of 1716-1718. This war was a conflict between the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria and the Ottoman Empire, which had been a longstanding rivalry that extended over centuries. It was fueled by the Ottoman's expansionist goals and the Habsburg's efforts to withstand and repel such advances.  During the Austro-Turkish War, the Habsburgs, led by Prince Eugene of Savoy, managed to achieve notable victories against the Ottomans. This included taking over the Banat, Serbia, and Little Walachia (Oltenia) territories. The subsequent Treaty of Passarowitz confirmed the Austrian acquisition of these lands, marking a significant territorial loss for the Ottoman Empire. Little Walachia, or Oltenia, is a historical region located in the southwestern part of present-day Romania. It was an important area for both parties due to its strategic position and resources. Losing this region, along with Banat and Serbia, signaled that the Ottoman Empire was on the defensive and had become less likely to engage in further aggression in Europe. In the following decades, the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735-1739) unfolded, which pitted the Ottoman Empire against a coalition of Austria and Russia. This conflict ultimately ended with the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739. As a result of this treaty, the Ottoman Empire managed to regain control over Serbia and Oltenia (Little Walachia), reversing their previous losses. However, at the same time, they lost the port of Azov, located north of the Crimean Peninsula, to the Russians. The Treaty of Belgrade, in turn, provided the Ottoman Empire with a period of peace lasting for nearly a generation. During this time, Austria and Russia were preoccupied with dealing with the rising power of Prussia, which consequently alleviated any imminent threat to the Ottomans.  In conclusion, it was the Ottoman Empire that lost Little Walachia (Oltenia) in 1718 due to the Treaty of Passarowitz, which followed the Austro-Turkish War of 1716-1718. Despite regaining these territories in the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739, this episode demonstrated the changing balance of power in Europe, as well as the Ottoman Empire's waning influence and inability to maintain its previous expansionist ambitions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nepalin poliittinen ja taloudellinen tilanne on kokenut merkittäviä muutoksia monarkian jälkeisellä aikakaudella, ja Kiinan tuella on ollut keskeinen rooli tässä prosessissa. Nepalin monarkia, joka oli hallinnut maata vuosisatojen ajan, kumottiin vuonna 2008, mikä merkitsi uuden aikakauden alkua maan historiassa. Aiemmin eristäytynyt ja harvaan asuttu Himalajan kuningaskunta alkoi avautua ulkomaailmalle ja aloitti uuden paikkansa etsimisen kansainvälisessä kentässä. Tämä politiinen murros avasi oven Kiinan ja Nepalin välisten suhteiden lujittamiselle. Maoistijohtoisen hallituksen valinta Kathmandun pääkaupungissa kuvasti Nepalin kansan toiveita muutoksesta ja paremmasta tulevaisuudesta. Hallitus, jolla oli vahvat yhteydet Kiinaan, pyrki rakentamaan uutta kumppanuutta maan pohjoisen naapurin kanssa. Taloudellisen yhteistyön ja kehitysavun kasvu molemmin puolin rajaa vahvisti kahden maan välistä yhteyttä entisestään. Kiina on investoinut voimakkaasti Nepalin infrastruktuuriin, kuten teihin, voimalaitoksiin ja lentokenttiin, mikä on auttanut Nepalia saavuttamaan paremman taloudellisen kehityksen. Suhteilla Kiinaan on ollut myös strategista merkitystä molemmille maille, kun ne pyrkivät tasapainottamaan Intian kasvavaa taloudellista ja poliittista vaikutusvaltaa alueella.  Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että Nepalin monarkian lakkauttaminen ja maolaisjohtoisen hallituksen valinta Katmandussa ovat johtaneet siihen, että Kiinan ja Nepalin väliset suhteet ovat lähentyneet merkittävästi.

In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. Question: who stuck the needle in the boy's arm? Options:  A. the boy himself  B. the boy's mom  C. not enough information  D.

This package contains Chia Seed POWDER, which I assume is ground up seed (or the remainder from packaging whole seeds) that you have no way of identifying whether or not has additional filler.  Not going to bother returning a 7 product, but just disappointed when the page advertises whole seeds. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Identifying the task Usage: Divide the given review into two classes: negative or positive. Example: In this task, we need to classify the review as either negative or positive based on its content. The review talks about a disappointing experience with the product, so it can be classified as negative because the customer expressed dissatisfaction. Part #2: Analyzing the review content Usage: Examine the tone, words and overall sentiment of the review. Example: The phrases \\"the first time I tried purchasing a food product over the internet\\" and \\"as feared\\" show the reluctance and suspicion the customer had initially. The customer also states, \\"Not going to bother returning a 7 product, but just disappointed,\\" which highlights the negative sentiment of the review. Part #3: Consider the issue addressed Usage: Check if the review focuses on the product itself or any external factors unrelated to the quality or performance of the product. Example: The review talks about receiving \\"something other than what was pictured\\" and having \\"no way of identifying whether or not it has additional filler.\\" This complaint is directly related to the product, which emphasizes that the review is negative. Part #4: Determine the final class based on findings Usage: Classify the review as positive or negative based on the analysis in the previous steps. Example: Based on the review's negative sentiment, dissatisfaction with the product, and the issue being related to the product itself, the solution would classify this review as negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: You can go with friends if liked but don't take them along if you feel that all they do is distract you or try to convince you to get clothing different from that which you like. If they're good at giving honest advice though, they may be helpful. Find out what clothing is on display and considered currently trendy by browsing various different stores. Having an overview of what's in fashion can help you to get a better idea of what you like best. This means not buying the first things you see––the items will still be there when you go back after thinking about it. Nice, one-off pieces can be found for little money in such stores and these can really add to your look. Many such stores color code the clothing, making it easy for you to find pieces in your favorite colors. A touch of unique is good for your fashion style. For example: \\"I want to get a new skirt, two pairs of jeans, and a white lace sweater today\\". Having specific items in mind will help you to focus solely on what you really want to get, instead of getting distracted on things you don't need or already have in your closet. Choose colors that look good on you and that fit well. Remember that fashion is not worth discomfort, especially not at school. Summary:","output":"When shopping for clothes, consider whether or not to bring friends based on their helpfulness and honesty.

In Sentence 1, \\"Smother a yawn\\" refers to suppressing or stifling a yawn, which means to hold it back or try not to yawn. Step 2: Identify the meaning of the word \\"smother\\" in Sentence 2. In Sentence 2, \\"The butter cream smothered the cake\\" refers to the buttercream covering the cake completely and thickly. Here, it means to spread or coat something all over a surface. Step 3: Compare the meanings of \\"smother\\" in both sentences. Now that we have identified the meanings of \\"smother\\" in both sentences, it is clear that the meanings are not exactly the same. While both meanings involve the idea of covering or suppressing something, the context and the action associated with each usage of the word are different. In Sentence 1, \\"smother\\" implies suppressing an action (a yawn); in Sentence 2, it signifies the act of spreading a substance (buttercream) completely over an object (a cake).

He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Instead,my friend was always hard up for cash. He did not have much money. And the money he did earn was chicken feed -- very little. Sometimes Al even had to accept handouts,gifts from his family and friends. But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a deadbeat. He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply _ pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact,he was often a cheapskate. He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all. One day,Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot. He won a great deal of money. Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new ear. He splurged on the one thing that he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had money to burn. He had more money than he needed and it was burning a hole in his pocket so he spent it quickly. When we got together for a meal at a restaurant,Al paid every time. He would always foot the bill,and pick up the tab. He told me the money made him feel like a million dollars. He was very happy. But,Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was down and out again. He had no money left. He was back to being strapped for cash. He had spent his bottom dollar, his very last amount. He did not even build up a nest egg. He had not saved any of the money. I admit I do feel sorry for my friend. He had enough money to live like a king. Instead,he is back to living on a shoestring--a very low budget. Some might say he is penny wise and pound foolish. He is wise about small things,but not about important things. Question: Why did A1 live a poor life again after he won the lottery? - Because he lost a lot of money he had won. - Because he spent much money freely on unnecessary things. - Because his friend borrowed much money from him. - Because he gave away a lot of money to others.

If you ask what is going on, someone will tell you it's a charity activity. Though this charity program has not yet officially begun for Chinese users, this little green symbol has proven popular among Chinese Windows Live Messenger users. Windows Live Messenger's official blog announced on March 1 that Microsoft was beginning an \\"I'm\\" program in the United States. Every time someone starts a conversation using \\"I'm\\", Microsoft shares a part of the program's advertising income with nine organizations devoted to social causes. With every instant message a user sends, it helps deal with things one feels most interested in, including poverty, child protection, disease and worsening environment. One only has to add a certain code next to one's name for the organization one would like to support. \\"*red'u\\" is for the American Red Cross, \\"*bgca\\" is for Boys & Girls Clubs of America and \\"*unicef\\" stands for the American branch of UNICEF. After a Chinese blogger named \\"hung\\" introduced this program on his blog on March 2, \\"I'm\\" entered the Internet in China with no actual support from Microsoft. Beijing-based Youth Weekend reported that famous IT blogger Keso regarded this program's rapid spread as a successful virus marketing case. He thinks that the success of the \\"I'm\\" program is because it's spread by users without being a bother to others. This answers why \\"I'm\\" has spread so rapidly across the Internet like a virus with almost no advertisement. However, Feng Jinhu from the press center for Microsoft China toldYouth Weekendthat the \\"I'm\\" project is only for Messenger users in the United States. Instant messages sent by Chinese users would not count. This has not affected Chinese Messenger users' interest in the little green symbol. These users hope their instant messages will actually contribute to charitable organizations someday. Question: The following descriptions about the \\"I'm\\" program are correct EXCEPT   _  .

These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment.

Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders.

Right after the Pentagon was hit, NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft. It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all.

Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.

Summarize: The Scottish first minister has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump both before and after his victory in last year's election. Ms Sturgeon will not meet any members of Mr Trump's administration during her current trip to the US. But she said she would not decline any invitation to meet him in Scotland. The first minister, who was speaking after an event at Stanford University in California, said she had not made a deliberate attempt to avoid Mr Trump or his team during her five-day tour of the United States. Ms Sturgeon told the Press Association: \\"This trip has been principally business-focused so we're not going to Washington on this occasion. \\"I fully expect, during his presidency, President Trump will come to the UK and come to Scotland. \\"As first minister of Scotland, I'm not going to decline to meet him.\\" Mr Trump, whose corporation owns two major Scottish golf resorts, is widely expected to make a state visit to the UK later this year. The president's mother came from the Isle of Lewis in the Western Isles and he has often emphasised his Scottish ancestry. But Ms Sturgeon stripped him of his role as a business ambassador for Scotland in 2015 after he proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States. She told the Scottish Parliament in November that she stood by her previous criticisms of Mr Trump, and pledged not to maintain a \\"diplomatic silence\\" in the face of any racism, misogyny or intolerance from the president. The two political leaders spoke by telephone in December, when Ms Sturgeon congratulated him on his victory in the presidential election. Ms Sturgeon - who backed Hillary Clinton ahead of the presidential election - also discussed the \\"longstanding relationship between Scotland and the United States\\" with Mr Trump. The first minister's speech at Stanford University made no mention of Mr Trump, with the first minister focusing on the global role she believes Scotland would be able to play if it were to become independent. She also urged the UK government to recognise the \\"right\\" of Scots to decide their own future through another independence referendum. The UK government has already declined Ms Sturgeon's request to be given the powers to hold a legally-binding independence referendum before the Brexit process is complete. It has argued that the focus should instead be on getting the best deal for the whole of the UK in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU - with the prime minister repeatedly saying \\"now is not the time\\" for another vote on independence. But Ms Sturgeon said that position was \\"not sustainable\\" and insisted she was \\"fairly certain\\" there would be another referendum. While the legislation that created the Scottish Parliament reserved powers over constitutional issues to the UK, Ms Sturgeon argued that it was \\"quite a vague term\\" and said the issue had never been tested in court. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he had written to the first minister asking whether these comments suggested she was planning to mount a legal challenge as part of what he described as a \\"war of attrition over independence\\".

Determine the sentiment: This Showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. After reading the viewer comments, I was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy. Yeah, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy/Drama under Genre. That sure is misleading, isn't it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before logging onto this website so I did not have that expectation. In fact, based on the synopsis of what I heard, I fully expected it to simply be a Drama. I'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes. Another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character-driven'. 'Driving Miss Daisy' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind. Someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial. Tom's (Danny Glover) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie. That is, how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops, if you will. However, they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and move 'up' in the world. Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood. His chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color. It was because of everything the 'interloper' represented; everything that Tom had left behind. In essence, Tom had become an Oreo cookie: Black on the outside but White on the inside. The last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written, directed and acted (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have ever had the pleasure to witness. I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door (don't want to give it away). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs Tom which college Tom -Two is going to or when she releases it, all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless, the denouement is great. You know that life on that street will never be the same. My favorite kind of character-driven flick: people go through problems, some pain, do their dance, they grow, they change, and life goes on. As an audience member, I may learn something or be inspired.","output":"To analyze the sentiment of this text, I will break it down into different sections and evaluate the polarity (positive, negative or neutral) of each. 1.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Robin thought of something and quickly wrote it down before they forgot again.  Given the question \\"How would Robin feel afterwards?\\", is \\"slow and moronic\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"No, \\"slow and moronic\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would Robin feel afterwards?\\" This question asks about Robin's emotions or mental state after writing something down, and \\"slow and moronic\\" are adjectives that describe cognitive abilities, not feelings or emotions. Instead, we should consider other adjectives that describe Robin's emotional state or mental condition after completing the task of writing something down before they forget it again. A more appropriate answer to this question could involve emotions such as relief, satisfaction, or accomplishment. These emotions encompass Robin's mental state after they have successfully remembered and recorded the thought, showing that they have achieved a task that was important to them. Relief, for example, could indicate that Robin was worried about forgetting their idea, and successfully writing it down eases that anxiety or concern. Satisfaction might suggest that Robin feels pleased with their quick action in capturing the idea before it slipped away. Accomplishment indicates a sense of achievement in completing a task, which, in this case, is writing down the idea before it could be forgotten. In summary, while \\"slow and moronic\\" does not accurately represent Robin's emotions or mental state after writing down their thought, more appropriate descriptors, such as relief, satisfaction, or accomplishment, would better answer the question about how Robin would feel afterwards. It's essential to focus on adjectives that describe emotional states rather than cognitive abilities when responding to questions about feelings or mental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The phrasing \\"A woman wearing a black shirt walks among a crowd in a city\\" is essentially similar to \\"A black clad woman is walking through the streets among a large crowd.\\" There is some room for interpretation due to different structures in both the sentences but the core essence of the action being described remains the same. The first phrase \\"A woman wearing a black shirt\\" corresponds directly to the phrase \\"A black-clad woman\\" from the second sentence. While the sentence doesn't specify that the woman's shirt is black in the second sentence, the term \\"black-clad\\" means that she is dressed in black, which can naturally include a black shirt. The action described by the phrase \\"walks among a crowd in a city\\" is also similar to the action \\"is walking through the streets among a large crowd\\". Both these actions speak of a woman, the subject of the sentence, walking in an urban setting, indicated by the words \\"in a city\\" and \\"through the streets\\". They both mention her walking among a crowd. The only major difference between both sentences is the relatively minor details. The first sentence does not mention how large the crowd is like the second one does, but it is quite a small difference and not enough to completely diverge the meanings of these two sentences. To put it succinctly, both sentences illustrate the same scene--a woman dressed in black, navigating her way through a crowded city.

Harvey Nichols' Virtual Makeover Mirrors The world of beauty is also witnessing a technological revolution, as demonstrated by Harvey Nichols' state-of-the-art digital mirrors. Designed to streamline the makeup application process, these smart mirrors virtually superimpose makeup products onto customers' faces, offering a glimpse into the desired outcome without having to physically test the beauty products.

She taught in Massachusetts for ten years, and was invited to Bordentown, New Jersey to teach in a school. She saw that these communities needed _ education for their citizens, and she took action by creating a free school, one of the first in her state. But later, ignoring her, officials named a male instead as the head teacher. Disappointed, she left her job and moved to Washington D.C., becoming the first woman employed by the US Patent Office. Clara Barton was forever changed by her experience with the army in the Civil War. She saw doctors use leaves when dealing with injuries since they had nothing else. The medical supplies were well behind the army, who were moving faster than their medical supply lines. She brought in a truck of medical supplies that she collected personally some years ago. Miss Barton continued to work on the battlefields throughout the war. She helped in the identification of 13,000 dead Union soldiers. This non-stop work made her fully exhausted, and upon recommendation by her physicians, she traveled to Europe where she recovered energy and enriched herself. While in Europe, and still in poor health, Miss Barton was moved by the hardship on people brought about by the France-Prussia war. She helped in their relief effort, which encouraged her to create the Red Cross, which served the whole army and common people under a neutral flag. Clara Barton returned to America and then began the establishment of the American Red Cross. The US government did not think there would ever be another war after the Civil War.

One man draws out the wire, another strengthens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, and a fifth gives it a head. Just to make the head requires two or three different operations. The work of making pins is divided into about eighteen different operations, which in some factories are all performed by different people, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them.     Ten men, Smith said, in this way, turned out twelve pounds of pins a day or about 4,800 pins a worker. But if all of them had worked separately and independently without division of labor, they certainly could not have made twenty pins in a day and not even one.     There can be no doubt that division of labor is an efficient way of organizing work.  Fewer people can make more pins. Adam Smith saw this, but he also took it for granted that the division of labor is itself responsible for economic growth and development and it accounts for the difference between expanding economies and those that stand still. In fact, the division of labor adds nothing new, and it only enables people to produce more of what they already have.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Article 2 of Brazil's Constitution defined the roles of both the Emperor and the Assembleia Geral (General Assembly or Parliament), which in 1824 was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, as the nation's representatives. The Constitution endowed the Assembly with both status and authority, and created legislative, moderating, executive and judicial branches as \\"delegations of the nation\\" with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined.The prerogatives and authority granted to the legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in the functioning of the government—it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article 13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct. Regarding matters of foreign policy, the Constitution (under Article 102) required that the General Assembly be consulted about declarations of war, treaties and the conduct of international relations. A determined legislator could exploit these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments and force reconsideration of policies.During its annual four-month sessions the Assembly conducted public debates. These were widely reported and formed a national forum for the expression of public concerns from all parts of the country. It was frequently a venue for expressing opposition... Answer:","output":"The body that could and would play a major and indispensable role in the functioning of the government, according to the context provided, is the Assembleia Geral or General Assembly of Brazil. Established by Article 2 of Brazil's 1824 Constitution, the General Assembly was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, serving as the nation's representatives with significant status and authority. The Constitution sought to create a government based on the separation of powers through legislative, moderating, executive, and judicial branches. The General Assembly's numerous prerogatives and responsibilities, as outlined in the Constitution, ensured that it played a pivotal role in maintaining checks and balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it protected. Under Article 13 of the Constitution, the General Assembly possessed exclusive powers to enact, revoke, interpret, and suspend laws. It controlled government finances by authorizing annual expenditures and taxes, approving and overseeing government loans and debts, and setting the size of the military's forces. This body was also responsible for creating offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare, and ensuring adherence to the Constitution, which granted it substantial authority to examine and debate government policies and conduct. In matters of foreign policy, the Constitution mandated the General Assembly's consultation on declarations of war, treaties, and international relations (Article 102). As a result, legislators could leverage these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments, and force reconsiderations of policies. Furthermore, the General Assembly conducted public debates during its annual four-month sessions, providing a national forum to articulate public concerns from all parts of the country.

Write a summary based on this article: A-list celebrities came out in droves on Monday night to take part in the \\"Hand in Hand\\" hurricane relief benefit, which raised more than 44 million for the victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.      During the telethon, Stephen Colbert announced that Apple was donating 5 million and Jimmy Fallon added that Albertsons Cos. and Merck each gave 1 million.      NBA star Chris Paul also said that the NBA Players Association, which donated 500,000, would match any professional basketball player's donation up to 20,000.      Kevin Mazur/Hand in Hand/Getty Images      \\"We come together today to love on people that have been devastated by the hurricanes,\\" Stevie Wonder, who sang \\"Lean on Me,\\" said at the start of the telethon. \\"When love goes into action, it preferences no color of skin, no ethnicity, no religious beliefs, no sexual preferences, and no political persuasions. It just loves.\\"      Kevin Mazur/Hand in Hand/Getty Images      Throughout the hour-long benefit, which was broadcast on four networks, including ABC, celebrities stressed the importance of unity. However, the current politic climate was referenced at several points. In video addresses, Drake admitted that that news cycle recently has been \\"extremely overwhelming,\\" while Beyonce noted that, \\"it's impossible to watch the news without seeing violence or racism in this country.\\"      \\"Just when you think it couldn’t possibly get worse, natural disasters take take precious life, do massive damage, and forever change lives, leaving behind contaminated water, flooded hospitals, schools, and nursing homes and countless families are now homeless,\\" she continued. “Natural disasters don’t discriminate.

It doesn’t matter if you’re from [Houston neighborhoods] Third Ward or River Oaks, we’re all in this together.”      John Shearer/Hand in Hand/Getty Images      What a powerful and beautiful night it was. ???? #HandInHand Continue to donate at: https://t.co/HxImEwwhu9 pic.twitter.com/tISMGZMREx — iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) September 13, 2017      Beyonce, a Houston native, also touched on climate change, pointing out other natural disasters that have taken place around the world in the past few weeks, including flooding in India and an earthquake in Mexico. Wonder also discussed the issue, and had harsh words for climate change deniers.      \\"Anyone who believes that there is no such thing as global warming must be blind or unintelligent,\\" he said.      The telethon was also punctuated by stars including Kerry Washington, Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs; Oprah Winfrey and Cher; and Justin Timberlake telling stories of those who were directly impacted by the hurricanes, as well as performances in locations around the country. In Nashville, Usher and Blake Shelton sang \\"Stand By Me,\\" while George Strait, Miranda Lambert, Chris Stapleton, Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett sang \\"Texas\\" and \\"I Believe\\" from San Antonio. Other performances included Luis Fonsi and Tori Kelly singing \\"Hallelujah,\\" Brad Paisley, Demi Lovato, Darius Rucker, Cece Winans performing \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" and Dave Matthews singing \\"Mercy.\\"      \\"This is what we can give people with our donations tonight.

Billy Crystal closed the telethon thanking everyone at all the call centers, and reminding people that the phone lines and donation centers will be open all night. He concluded, \\"This is what America is really all about.\\"      Comic Relief USA, the nonprofit behind Idol Gives Back, will manage the donations and distribute them to organizations including the Rebuild Texas Fund, Feeding Texas, Habitat for Humanity and United Way of Greater Houston.      Originally, the Hand in Hand telethon was meant to benefit the victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas. It was later expanded to include those affected by Irma, which hit the southeast this weekend. It has been estimated that the storms caused between 150 billion and 290 billion in damage to Texas and Florida.      At least 70 people died during Hurricane Harvey, and 22 deaths have been reported in the U.S. from Hurricane Irma. ||||| At a time when fewer people than ever watch television live, how does a telethon have an impact? By going viral.      During Tuesday’s cross-network and cross-platform airing of Hand in Hand: A Benefit for Hurricane Relief, that mission, certainly secondary to that of raising funds to benefit the victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, was accomplished seconds into the telecast.      Stevie Wonder, the first of the Oscar red carpet’s worth of celebrities to make heartfelt pleas for donations via live feeds in Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, and San Antonio, seemed to kick things off innocently enough, with platitudes of coming together “to love” those who have been devastated by the storms, regardless of “political persuasions.”      Well, except, Wonder instantly got political.      “Anyone who believes there is no such thing as global warming must be blind, or unintelligent,” he said, practically dropping the mic before the show even started. “Lord save us all.”      Was it exactly “George Bush doesn’t care about black people?” No, of course not. But it was a potentially polarizing and alienating move at a time when, even as images of the powerful storms and monumental wreckage they caused literally flooded our screens, the impulse, especially from politicians, to call for prayers in lieu of recognizing science has become an exasperated meme.      To wit, even after we tweeted out Wonder’s quote, we got responses chiding the singer for “undermining the objective of the telethon by alienating half the country in the first 30 seconds.”      Were Wonder’s comments unscripted, like Kanye West’s were in 2005 at the telethon for Hurricane Katrina aid? It’s too soon to know that yet. (It’s not like there was teleprompter copy for Stevie Wonder.)      But it’s worth noting that Wonder wasn’t the only celebrity to address the elephant in the room of climate change, raising eyebrows in the otherwise characteristically congenial and earnest—often to a fault—affair.      In fact, it was arguably the program’s biggest booking, Beyoncé, who also brought it up—and in a pre-taped video at that, eschewing the idea that at the very least her comments could have been spontaneous. It hints that, for maybe the first time in an event like this, organizers weren’t just amenable to the idea of political truth bombs amidst the sob stories and scenes of tragedy, but explicitly encouraged it.      “The effects of climate change are playing out around the world every day. Just this past week you’ve seen devastation from the monsoon in India, an 8.1 earthquake in Mexico, and two catastrophic hurricanes,” Beyoncé said, regally narrating our end times. “We have to be prepared for what comes next.”      It’s interesting to look at the way we remember Kanye West’s comments, standing next to a flabbergasted Mike Myers, all these years later. The knee-jerk labeling of “inappropriate” has evolved, generally speaking, into finding it mostly hilarious.      Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

He took the artifice out of the proceedings, called out the bullshit in the self-congratulation of celebrities who happily rearrange their schedules for events like these maybe because it’s a good deed, but maybe also because in a weird way it’s a status symbol to be invited to present at one of these things, like a christening to the A-list.      There was a certain hypocrisy then in soliciting donations to help a government that was systematically failing a targeted demographic of its citizens. And he wasn’t going to stand there and pretend that there wasn’t.      It may not have been as incendiary, but Stevie Wonder and Beyoncé making a plea to acknowledge climate change similarly evades any intrinsic hypocrisy. How could all these celebrities, so many who used their voices so loudly in the previous election, stand in front of footage of those floods and not talk about the urgent contributing factor that the party in power refuses to blame?      In fact, politics, even in the telethon’s name, slyly pervaded most of the night.      “Hand in Hand” refers to both how Americans helped each other regardless of background as the water levels rose, but also how, as a country in an explosive time of cultural divide, we must put aside our politics to assist in overcoming this devastation as one.      “National disasters don’t discriminate,” Beyoncé said. “They don’t see if you’re an immigrant, black or white, Hispanic, or Asian, Jewish, or Muslim, rich or poor. It doesn’t matter if you’re from Third Ward or River Oaks, we’re all in this together.” Most speakers, which included everyone from Tom Hanks to Leonardo DiCaprio to Will Smith, spoke about how heartened they were to see discrimination and opposition be cast aside to assist those in need, because that’s what real American values are.      It might seem bleak that an event like this would need to repeatedly remind us of that, as if we’re worried that might no longer be our instinct. And it might seem absurd that political parties and agendas, mentioned in speeches from The Rock to organizer Scooter Braun, are even brought into a telethon about weather, but that’s the situation of 2017, upsetting as that is.      And the truth is, that’s precisely what a telethon in 2017 needs in order to be effective. The sanitized, emotionally manipulating hodgepodge of montages, testimonials, and musical performances seems dated in an age where viewers seek out and respond to point of view.      As news stories poured in about immigrants refusing to be admitted to storm shelters out of fear of being reported, or how racial inequality in major affected cities left low-income communities, and, often, minorities most susceptible to the dangers of flooding, the door was left wide open for charged political statements—even if these telethons aren’t typically viewed as appropriate outlets for that.      But times have changed. In fact, the “traditional” elements of this telecast were its weakest points.      So much of it is familiar. You could’ve pretty much predicted the set list before the show even began.      “Lean on Me”? Check, courtesy of Stevie Wonder. You bet Tori Kelly has “Hallelujah” covered. Usher and Blake Shelton did a competent “Stand by Me,” while the supergroup of Darius Rucker, Demi Lovato, Brad Paisley, and CeCe Winans took us to church from Nashville.      The stories of resilience, bravery, and selflessness that the celebrities told dutifully made you cry.      Cher and Oprah Winfrey, arm-in-arm, tell a story about a human chain that formed to help an elderly man. Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon have a tragic tale about a little girl whose mother died clutching her, attempting to save her from the floodwaters.      Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson wring out your tear ducts talking about wide-eyed babies holding onto each other while waiting to be saved from a rooftop, while Julia Roberts and George Clooney remember the man who played the piano while the waters rose in his house: “Let’s make sure there are always songs to fill the air.”      In between it all, everyone’s favorite camera shots: the rows of phone banks manned by real-life famous people, fielding your calls for donations. Barbra Streisand, Andy Cohen, Nicki Minaj, Julianne Moore, Ryan Seacrest, Bruce Willis, Robert De Niro, Jon Stewart, Sofia Vergara: They’re all there, and more.      We mentioned the impact of these telethons going viral. Gone are the days in which we’ll gather round a TV because it’s amusing to see Marcia Gay Harden answer the telephone. But, as every shot of those phone banks showed, these celebrities were Instagramming the hell out of this telethon—a truly clever way to drum up more reach for these charities.      A photo of Sofia Vergara smelling Oprah’s ponytail while pleading for money? Sure! Ryan Seacrest posing next to Daniel Craig? That hotline number is the caption. Roughly 400 selfies with various celebs from Rita Wilson’s account? Yes please. Each gets a like—and hopefully a donation, too.      There’s no discounting the nobility and the generosity of any talent that takes part in a massive event like this, which seems like an unprecedented undertaking and monumental achievement—sadly, until the next one comes along.      We’re merely commenting on how much harder it is to generate buzz about them as an “event” in a society that, forget any political divides, is more splintered in their pop culture habits than ever.      Might the possibility of an impassioned political swipe at Donald Trump lure more viewers to the telecast? Undoubtedly. Look to the moments that have resonated from any recent awards show for proof of that.      As they’ve done with this hurricane telethon—and the dozens of aid-generating events like it that have taken place in the past—these famous faces are more than happy to use their clout to raise money and awareness. What we’re seeing as more effective than ever, and perhaps even wish there was more of in Hand in Hand, is them using their voices. In the meantime, their social-media accounts are a good start. ||||| Published on Sep 12, 2017      Stevie Wonder live from Los Angeles performs Bill Withers' Lean On Me for Hand In Hand: A Benefit for Hurricane Relief to aid Harvey and Irma victims in Texas and Florida on September 12, 2017.

The event spanned multiple networks and online. The star-studded telethon which filmed in New York, Los Angeles, Nashville, and San Antonio raised over 44 million and included appearances from Oprah Winfrey, Cher, Justin Timberlake, Billy Crystal, Kerry Washington, Stephen Colbert, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Will Smith, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Dwayne Johnson, Beyonce, and many more.      The hour-long event began when the legendary Stevie Wonder encouraged working together regardless of race, religion, political affiliation or sexual preference to help those devastated by the storms. Before performing a rendition of the classic Bill Withers tune “Lean On Me,” he took a jab at climate change deniers saying, “Anyone who believes there’s no such thing as global warming must be blind or unintelligent. Lord, please save us all.”      Beyonce, a native of Houston, gave a passionate pre-recorded segment, saying, “During a time where it’s impossible to watch the news without seeing violence or racism in this country, just when you think it couldn’t possibly get worse, natural disasters take precious life, do massive damage and forever change lives.” She added, “Natural disasters don’t discriminate. They don’t see if you’re an immigrant, black or white, Hispanic or Asian, Jewish or Muslim, wealthy or poor. It doesn’t matter if you’re from Third Ward or River Oaks, we’re all in this together. Seeing everyone of different racial, social and religious backgrounds put their own lives at risk to help each other survive, restored my faith in humanity.”      The telethon generally stayed clear of politics and controversial moments like Kanye West’s “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” comment during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina benefit concert. Instead, there was an overwhelming, genuine focus on unity and encouraging of help to those affected by the hurricane.      During the telethon, Colbert broke the news that Apple donated 5 million while Jimmy Fallon said that Albertsons and Merck donated 1 million on top of that. Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul, who was on hand answering phones, said NBA Players Association not only donated 500,000 but said they would match any professional basketball player’s donation up to 20,000.      The telethon also included footage from Houston as it tried to rebuild from the aftermath of Harvey and more encouraging, heartfelt words and appearances from celebrities including Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Julianne Moore, Bruce Willis, Sofia Vergara, Justin Bieber, Taraji P. Henson, and more. The phone bank itself was a who’s who of Hollywood. Lupita Nyong’o was active on social media, documenting the event.

Since that day, we have joined together — neighbor helping neighbor, without stopping to think about race, religion or anything else.”      Matthew McConaughey, who is also a Texas native, took to the stage and said that we “can’t bring back what they lost, but we can help them know where to take the next step and provide some solid footing for them to place their next foot. A path to stability. To a place where they can rebuild.”      In addition to the performance by Wonder, many other musicians and artists collaborated to give stirring, emotional performances. Usher and Blake Shelton did a duet of “Stand By Me” from Nashville while Luis Fonsi and Tori Kelly sang a soulful “Hallelujah.” Brad Paisley, Demi Lovato, Darius Rucker, and Cece Winans performed “With a Little Help from My Friends” and George Strait, Miranda Lambert, Chris Stapleton, Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett approriately closed the evening with a performance of “Texas” and “I Believe” from San Antonio. ||||| Summary:","output":"A special event called \\"Hand in Hand\\" took place with many famous celebrities coming together to help people who were hurt by big storms called Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Is it true that do germany get to keep the world cup based on the following text? The trophy has the engraving \`\`FIFA World Cup'' on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy on which the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The inscriptions state the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language; for example, \`\`1974 Deutschland'' or \`\`1994 Brasil''. In 2010, however, the name of the winning nation was engraved as \`\`2010 Spain'', in English, not in Spanish. As of 2018, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners, with Spain on later occasions written in Spanish (\`\`España''). FIFA's regulations now state that the trophy, unlike its predecessor, cannot be won outright: the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold.

Answer the following question: I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect. But ordinarily two would be sufficient.

The woman, his wife (Alisa Frejndlikh), joins him and scolds him for returning to his old ways, which will surely land him back in jail. The man argues briefly for her to let him go, that he must go, and he finally pushes her aside and leaves the room. As he leaves, his wife curses the day she ever met him and reproaches him for having begotten such a child. She falls to the ground, weeping.The man, Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky), goes to the waterfront to meet with a couple, a well-dressed woman and a man, Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn).

No sooner as these two men meet that they start bickering with each other. Stalker will guide these two men through The Zone. Writer explains that the reason for his trip is to recover his lost inspiration while Professors motivation is purely scientific curiosity.Stalker and the two men leave the bar for their dangerous mission into The Zone.

I thought maybe it was my age. After reading every book and article I could find on sex, relationships, and marriage, I started to wonder if maybe it wasn’t me. Maybe it was my marriage, maybe it was my husband. I never wanted to be “that woman“. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn’t last long. But, that’s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn’t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn’t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive. I told my husband that I’d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn’t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it’s just not in him to love me that way. A few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know. I shouldn’t have. I’ve experienced things with this other man that I never thought possible. Felt things I thought were only possible in movies. He’s a romantic. Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need. Deep, intimate conversations. Looking into one another’s eyes. Soft caresses. Words of adoration. These things he gives me almost daily. I never knew I needed romance because I’d never had it. This is how I need to be loved. After having felt this way, I can’t stay in my marriage. It’s not fair to either of us. I’m not sure what happened. Did we grow apart? Did one or both of us change?

After a series of defenses against fringe contenders (Hurricane Jackson, Pete Rademacher, Roy Harris, and Brian London), Patterson met Ingemar Johansson of Sweden, the number one contender, in the first of three fights. Johansson triumphed over Patterson on June 26, 1959, with the referee Ruby Goldstein stopping the fight in the third round after the Swede had knocked Patterson down seven times. Johansson became Sweden's first World Heavyweight Champion, thus becoming a national hero as the first European to defeat an American for the title since 1933.  Patterson knocked out Johansson in the fifth round of their rematch on June 20, 1960, to become the first man in history to regain the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. Johansson hit the canvas hard, seemingly out before he landed flat on his back. With glazed eyes, blood trickling from his mouth and his left foot quivering, he was counted out. Johansson lay unconscious for five minutes before he was helped onto a stool.  A third fight between them was held on March 13, 1961 and while Johansson put Patterson on the floor, Patterson retained his title by knockout in the sixth round to win the rubber match in which Patterson was decked twice and Johansson, once in the first round. Johansson had landed both right hands over Floyd's left jab. After getting up from the second knockdown, Floyd abandoned his jab and connected with a left hook that knocked down Johansson. After that, Patterson came on with a strong body attack that wore down Johansson. In the 6th round, Johansson caught Patterson with a solid right. But the power in Ingemar's punches was gone. Patterson won the fight in the 6th round by knockout.

In their second fight on June 20, 1960, Patterson made history by regaining the championship with a fifth-round knockout of Johansson. Their third and final fight took place on March 13, 1961, where Patterson retained his title by a knockout in the sixth round, winning the rubber match. Throughout these fights, both boxers showcased their skills, power, and resilience, with each fighter being knocked down multiple times before Patterson ultimately secured his place in boxing history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals.

The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

In 1995, Ghostface guest-starred extensively on fellow Clan member Raekwon's debut album, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., appearing on almost every song and receiving nearly equal billing. He also contributed songs to the Sunset Park and Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood soundtracks, which would be included on his first solo LP, Ironman, in 1996. The album, which debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, had a more pronounced soul influence (particularly 1970s soul) than previous Wu-Tang releases, and Ghostface's future albums would continue to feature this stylistic trait.  In 2000, he released his second studio album Supreme Clientele. The album was well received by critics and peaked #7 on the Billboard 200. It included \\"Apollo Kids\\", a popular single which featured Raekwon and had a sample of \\"Cool Breeze\\" by Solomon Burke. \\"Cherchez LaGhost\\", another single off the album, became a minor club hit. Supreme Clientele would be a turning point in RZA's influence on his sound, as only six songs are produced by the RZA, compared to Ironman, its predecessor where every song but one is produced by him. Though he contributed fewer beats to the project, RZA personally oversaw the mixing and production of the album as a whole, contributing to Supreme Clientele's unified sound.  Ghostface wasted little time in recording his next album, the heavily R&B-influenced Bulletproof Wallets, released a year after Supreme Clientele. Its feature single, \\"Never Be the Same Again\\", featured Carl Thomas and Raekwon.

Rover.com has raised 3.4 million to be the Airbnb of the dog-boarding market.      Rover is an alternative to dog kennels, much like how Airbnb offers an alternative to staying in hotels.      In addition to announcing the funding today, the Seattle company is also rolling out nationwide, after supporting only a handful of test markets.      Airbnb raised a blockbuster 112 million second round of funding last July from well-known Silicon Valley investor Andreessen Horowitz. In comparison, Rover has raised a much more modest round, and has nine employees. Investors in the round include Madrona Venture Group of Seattle, which led the round, CrunchFund, and other angels.      On the business side, there’s a big scale difference between the dog- and vacation-rental businesses. Despite the differences in scale, however, Rover’s CEO Aaron Easterly said the market opportunity is massive.      Easterly, who most recently worked at Microsoft in its advertising business, estimates the formal commercial dog-boarding market is worth up to 6.5 billion annually, and said that there’s a much larger informal market of people who rely on friends and family to take care of their pooches. He says that together the two are worth closer to 35 billion to 60 billion. That’s a lot of biscuits and squeaky toys.      The decision about where to leave your dog when you’re away from home is an emotional one, Easterly noted.      People want to make sure that their dogs are happy, and not just locked up in a kennel. On Rover, people can review homeowners’ profiles, so they can get a sense of how the owners would treat their dogs. Additionally, Easterly said, it’s common for the two sides to meet before a stay is booked.      Last week, I visited the company in their downtown Seattle offices with my dog, Fletch, to see just how much Rover drinks from the dog bowl.      Sure enough, my hyperactive mutt was allowed full access to the office, finding a variety of toys, from tennis balls to stuffed animals. The other four-legged residents welcomed him into their domain, although Easterly’s four-pound Pomeranian Caramel (a.k.a. Chief Rover), was wise to stay out of the way. A developer even offered to take a break to give Fletch a walk around the block.      Since launching in Seattle in November 2011, Rover.com has grown to over 10,000 active members in hundreds of cities across the country. It charges between 5 percent and 15 percent for the service, depending on a homeowner’s track record, including reviews and response times.      It has already dealt with some issues that Airbnb struggled with early on, like offering round-the-clock support and guarantees. Today, Rover is rolling out a Barkline (providing 24-hour customer service) nationwide to handle any emergencies. Rover also offers a satisfaction guarantee that covers the dog, its owner and the host, in case any problems arise.      But there are other requests that come up that are more cookie-cutter in nature.      In the video below, Easterly explains how one of the most important topics to dog owners is where their dog will sleep. Out of the 11 dogs he’s hosted, he said the biggest request was for the guest dog to stay in his bed — and sometimes under the covers. ||||| My Rover sitter sent me updates throughout the day and took care of my dog as if she were her own.      – Corinna F. |||||","output":"Rover.com, a dog-boarding platform, has raised 3.4 million in funding to expand its services as an alternative to dog kennels.

Answer the question A scientist conducts an experiment on the growth rate of a specific species of plant. Which of these is needed for the data to be relied upon by other scientists?","output":"First, let's consider the important factors that would make the data from the experiment reliable and credible for other scientists. Here is a step-by-step analysis: 1. A well-defined research question: The scientist should begin with a clear and concise research question that outlines the purpose and parameters of the experiment. This will help ensure the experiment is specifically designed to answer this question and provide valuable data. 2. A controlled experiment: The scientist should set up a controlled experiment, where all variables except the one being tested (in this case, the growth rate of the specific species of plant) are held constant. This is essential to ensure that the results can be directly attributed to the variable being tested and not influenced by confounding factors. 3. Random sampling: To ensure the results are generalizable to the larger population of that specific species of plant, the scientist should use random sampling when selecting plants for the experiment. This helps to eliminate selection bias and ensures the results can be relied upon by other scientists. 4. Replication: The experiment should be replicated multiple times to confirm the results. Replication is essential to establish the reliability of the data and ensure that the findings are not the result of chance or anomalies in a single experiment. 5. Proper documentation: The scientist should record all details of the experiment, including methodology, data collection, and analysis. This makes it possible for other scientists to review the details, understand the process, and assess the credibility of the findings. 6. Peer review: Submitting the research findings for peer review allows other experts in the field to evaluate the methodology, results, and conclusions of the experiment. This peer review process helps to ensure the scientific rigor and validity of the findings. If the scientist's experiment follows these protocols, then the data generated can be relied upon by other scientists as they contribute to the overall understanding of the growth rate of the specific species of plant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Is the community surrounding lake Tresco or lake Mahoe less likely to have contaminated water wells? The answer to this question is:","output":"The community surrounding Lake Tresco is less likely to have contaminated water wells as compared to the community surrounding Lake Mahoe. There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion. Firstly, Lake Mahoe is located right next to a large farm that grows various crops for the town. As mentioned in the description, huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields. These chemicals can be picked up by rainwater and runoff, which carries the chemicals to nearby bodies of water, such as Lake Mahoe. This can result in an increased risk of water contamination in the lake and the surrounding water wells. The use of fertilizers on the farm can cause excessive growth of water plants and algae in the lake. This process, known as eutrophication, can lead to dead zones where oxygen levels in the water are too low to support life. In some cases, harmful algal blooms may also occur, releasing toxins into the water that can be dangerous to both humans and wildlife. Additionally, the owner of the farm rents out his barn regularly for celebrations. This means that there may be an increased risk of pollutants, such as solid waste and wastewater, entering the lake from these events, further increasing the likelihood of water contamination in the area. On the other hand, Lake Tresco is located near a school, where children often come to play during recess. While it is possible for some level of water contamination to occur due to human activity (e.g., littering), the overall risk is likely to be lower compared to the situation at Lake Mahoe. There is no mention of large-scale agricultural activity or regular events with potential pollutants nearby, meaning that the community surrounding Lake Tresco has a lower probability of having contaminated water wells. It is important to note that this analysis is based on the information provided and various assumptions. To make a definitive conclusion about the water quality in both areas, water testing and analyses should be conducted by professionals to provide accurate data on the presence and levels of contaminants in the water wells surrounding both lakes. This would help the communities make informed decisions about water safety and potential remediation measures, if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She has no time for toys, and refuses to be treated as a child. During a blizzard on Christmas Eve, Lisa is transported to Toyland. She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night.

Background: Dan Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964 in Exeter, New Hampshire. He has a younger sister, Valerie (born 1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1975). Brown attended Exeter's public schools until the ninth grade. He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997. Context: After graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a synthesizer, and self-producing a children's cassette entitled SynthAnimals, which included a collection of tracks such as \\"Happy Frogs\\" and \\"Suzuki Elephants\\"; it sold a few hundred copies. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled Perspective, targeted to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills Preparatory School.  He also joined the National Academy of Songwriters, and participated in many of its events. It was there that he met Blythe Newlon, a woman 12 years his senior, who was the Academy's Director of Artist Development. Though it was not officially part of her job, she took on the seemingly unusual task of helping to promote Brown's projects; she wrote press releases, set up promotional events, and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his career. She and Brown also developed a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their associates until 1993, when Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They married in 1997, at Pea Porridge Pond, near Conway, New Hampshire.  In 1994 Brown released a CD titled Angels & Demons. Its artwork was the same ambigram by artist John Langdon which he later used for the novel Angels & Demons. The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement, thanking her \\"for being my tireless cowriter, coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and therapist\\". The CD included songs such as \\"Here in These Fields\\" and the religious ballad, \\"All I Believe\\".  Brown and his wife, Blythe, moved to his home town in New Hampshire in 1993. Brown became an English teacher at his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at Lincoln Akerman School, a small school for K-8th grade with about 250 students, in Hampton Falls. Question: When did he become a songwriter?. Whats the answer?","output":"Dan Brown became a songwriter around 1990 when he self-published a CD entitled Perspective. He moved to Hollywood in 1991 to pursue a career as a singer-songwriter and pianist.

The use of the word \\"tired\\" has a negative connotation because it implies exhaustion, fatigue, or a lack of enthusiasm or energy. This is often associated with negative emotions, such as boredom, irritation, or dissatisfaction. 2. The phrase \\"feels familiar\\" suggests that the experience or situation described is something that the person has encountered repeatedly. While familiarity can sometimes evoke positive emotions, such as comfort or security, in this context, the combination with \\"tired\\" makes it seem more like the person is expressing a sense of monotony or boredom, which is typically considered negative. 3.

Here's the sentence with proper punctuation: \\"12 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined.\\" Step-by-step breakdown: 1. \\"12 medium shrimp\\" - This phrase can act as an independent clause because it has a subject (shrimp) and a predicate (being 12 and medium). Therefore, it is correct to end this part of the sentence with a comma. 2. \\"peeled and deveined\\" - This phrase is a series of adjectives describing the state of the shrimp. In English, we usually separate adjectives with commas. However, in this case, the conjunction \\"and\\" already connects the two adjectives, so no more comma is required. The justification for adding the comma is to break up the sentence into more manageable parts, making it easier to read and understand. The comma after \\"shrimp\\" separates the main clause from the additional information about the shrimp's condition, improving the sentence's clarity."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The emotions described, such as anger, frustration, annoyance, and jealousy, indicate that the narrator is highly affected by the other person's actions and statements concerning their partner. Taking into account these emotions and the fact that the narrator is bothered by someone else discussing and fantasizing about their loved one, we can analyze the possible options that describe the narrator's temperament: [I] The narrator is unpossessive. This option does not seem accurate, as the narrator's strong emotions imply that they care about their partner and are affected by someone else's claims of ownership. An unpossessive person might not experience these intense emotions in a similar situation. [II] The narrator is jealous. This option appears to be the most fitting, as the narrator's emotions suggest that they feel a sense of competition for their partner's attention and do not appreciate another person's constant talking, fantasies, and claims about their partner. The narrator's jealousy may drive their anger, frustration, and annoyance. [III] The narrator is independent. Independence is not explicitly mentioned in the context provided, nor can it be inferred from the emotions expressed by the narrator. Thus, this option does not accurately describe the narrator's temperament in the given situation. [IV] The narrator is self-confident. A self-confident person might not be as impacted by someone else's talking about their partner or feel threatened by their claims. The strong emotions the narrator experiences, however, indicate that they are not entirely secure in their relationship or their position as their partner's significant other. Therefore, based on the context and emotions described, the most accurate option to describe the narrator's temperament would be: [II] The narrator is jealous."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unbeknownst to Mala and her fellow Terrians, the last inhabitants of Earth have exhausted the resources of their planet and those of three others, and are now searching for a new home. This Earthforce has discovered that the use of a Terraformer will make Terra habitable for humans but poisonous for Terrians. When the Earthlings embark on a hostile invasion of Terra, Mala's father, Roven (Dennis Quaid), is kidnapped.

While Mala nurses Jim back to health, the two forge a friendship and a plan that could save both the human race and the planet of Terra. Soon, however, they realize that peace will not be secured unless they can combat both the Terraformer and dark political forces that will stop at nothing in their drive to achieve power for power's sake.While Terra's message that peace is a question of free will and choice is a potent one, the exuberance of Mala and her young friends carries the film.

Chinese state media frequently treats Japan's atrocities of the past like breaking news of today. But lately, the steady flow of war history-related news has become a flood. Amid fast-deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations, China's State Archives Administration recently re-opened case files from a Chinese military tribunal in 1956 and launched a dedicated website to publish summaries of confessions by 45 convicted Japanese war criminals. Among the horrifying accounts posted online by Chinese authorities are confessions of raping countless women, burying people alive and performing human vivisections in China -- all handwritten by captured Japanese army officers after World War II and long sealed in the state archives in Beijing. The Chinese government's target is clear. \\"Since the Abe cabinet came into power in Japan,\\" begins the online introduction to the confessions, referring to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \\"It has openly confused right and wrong to mislead the public, in an attempt to whitewash the history of external aggression and colonialism.\\" Tense seas. China and Japan have a dark history of conflict, including the nine-year Second Sino-Japanese War during which the contentious Nanjing Massacre took place from December 13, 1937 to March 1, 1938. Japanese soldiers committed mass murders and forced Chinese and Korean women into sexual slavery during the occupation of Nanjing. But it was a more recent flare-up, say analysts, which brought the historic grievances back out into the open. Relations between China and Japan became strained in 2012 when Japan claimed islands in the East China Sea. China then declared in November 2013 an Air Defense Identification Zone over the East China Sea, imposing air traffic restrictions over the disputed area. China's moves have made Japan and other nations in South East Asia nervous over it's expanding military and more assertive foreign policy, accusing China of trying to change the status quo. A right turn. In December, Abe further stoked tensions by visiting the Yasukuni Shrine where Japanese soldiers are honored -- including wartime leaders convicted as class-A war criminals. Abe became the first sitting prime minister to make the provocative visit since Junichiro Koizumi went in 2006. Six months later, Abe declared a more liberal interpretation of Japan's post-war pacifist constitution, essentially lifting a decades-long ban that prevented its military from fighting abroad. The following month, China released the Japanese wartime confessions online. Beijing also marked the anniversary of the Second Sino-Japanese War with an elaborate commemoration ceremony at Lugou Bridge, the site of the first showdown. \\"China is responding to Prime Minister Abe's attempts to rehabilitate the discredited wartime past. It's trying to underscore the fact that Japan suffers from selective amnesia,\\" says Jeff Kingston, an expert in Asian regional tensions and a professor at Temple University, Japan Campus. Global strategy. For long-time China watchers, this back-and-forth may be escalating at an alarming rate, but it is nothing new. \\"Since the early 1990s, the communist party has been trying to stoke anti-Japanese patriotism among the Chinese people mostly because they wanted to regain some of the legitimacy they lost in the Tiananmen Square massacre,\\" says Kingston, referring to the bloody military crackdown on Chinese student demonstrators in 1989. For China's president, the nationalism stoked by anti-Japanese sentiment, could become a powerful tool. \\"Nationalism is a very potent force in China right now. Xi is strengthening nationalistic sentiment to unify the country behind him and reinforce his own position as leader,\\" says Frank Ching, a political commentator. Beyond fomenting patriotism at home, China is also reminding its international partners that Japan hasn't come clean about its past. Kingston explains that Japan's imperialist history \\"is Abe's Achilles' heel.\\" By highlighting Abe's right-wing inclinations, China can drive a wedge between the U.S. and Japan, while pulling South Korea -- another nation that suffers wartime scars inflicted by Japan -- closer. China appears to be using it's propaganda push to isolate Japan from its allies. Resolution. But China's heavy-handed propaganda may backfire in the end because foreign governments may see it in a more cynical light. \\"If they press their case more quietly, it would be more effective,\\" says Kingston. It may also lead the nations further away from resolution. \\"These battles over history undermine trust and limit the room for diplomacy. It's very difficult for both sides to find a face-saving way to climb down,\\" says Kingston. Abe has repeatedly called for face-to-face talks with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping. \\"The door for dialogue is always open on my side, and I hope China has the same attitude,\\" the Japanese leader said. But analysts are not hopeful for talks, as both nations wait for the other to make the first move. \\"The Chinese side has made it clear that they will not talk to Abe unless he takes action to show that his attitude has changed, but I don't see Abe doing that in the absence of any commitment from China for a meeting first,\\" says Ching. All eyes are now on the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit coming up in November during which Abe has invited Xi to a meeting on the sidelines. The two leaders have never met since both came to power in 2012. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. Chinese state media has increased coverage on Japan's wartime atrocities amid deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations. 2. The Chinese State Archives Administration re-opened case files from a 1956 Chinese military tribunal, publishing summaries of convicted Japanese war criminals' confessions. 3.

Please answer the following question: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Jobeth Williams  for the following movie plot:  The story follows several citizens and people they encounter after a nuclear attack on Lawrence, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri. The film's narrative is structured as a before-during-after scenario: the first segment introduces the various characters and their stories, the second shows the nuclear disaster itself, and the third details the effects of the fallout on the characters. Dr. Russell Oakes (Jason Robards) lives in the upper-class Brookside neighborhood with his wife (Georgann Johnson) and works in a hospital in downtown Kansas City. He is scheduled to teach a hematology class at the University of Kansas (KU) hospital in nearby Lawrence, Kansas, and is en route when he hears an alarming Emergency Broadcast System alert on his car radio. He exits the crowded freeway and attempts to contact his wife but gives up due to the long line at a phone booth. Oakes attempts to return to his home via the K-10 freeway and is the only eastbound motorist. The nuclear attack begins, and Kansas City is gripped with panic as air raid sirens wail. Oakes' car is permanently disabled by the electromagnetic pulse from the first high altitude detonation, as are all motor vehicles and electricity. Oakes is about 30 miles (48Â km) away from downtown when the missiles hit. His family, many colleagues, and almost all of Kansas City's population are killed. He walks 10 miles (16Â km) to Lawrence, which has been severely damaged from the blasts, and, at the university hospital, treats the wounded with Dr. Sam Hachiya (Calvin Jung) and Nurse Nancy Bauer (JoBeth Williams). Also at the university, science Professor Joe Huxley (John Lithgow) and students use a Geiger counter to monitor the level of nuclear fallout outside.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Abstract      Over a decade ago, the Atacama humanoid skeleton (Ata) was discovered in the Atacama region of Chile. The Ata specimen carried a strange phenotype—6-in stature, fewer than expected ribs, elongated cranium, and accelerated bone age—leading to speculation that this was a preserved nonhuman primate, human fetus harboring genetic mutations, or even an extraterrestrial. We previously reported that it was human by DNA analysis with an estimated bone age of about 6–8 yr at the time of demise. To determine the possible genetic drivers of the observed morphology, DNA from the specimen was subjected to whole-genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform with an average 11.5× coverage of 101-bp, paired-end reads. In total, 3,356,569 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were found as compared to the human reference genome, 518,365 insertions and deletions (indels), and 1047 structural variations (SVs) were detected. Here, we present the detailed whole-genome analysis showing that Ata is a female of human origin, likely of Chilean descent, and its genome harbors mutations in genes (COL1A1, COL2A1, KMT2D, FLNB, ATR, TRIP11, PCNT) previously linked with diseases of small stature, rib anomalies, cranial malformations, premature joint fusion, and osteochondrodysplasia (also known as skeletal dysplasia). Together, these findings provide a molecular characterization of Ata's peculiar phenotype, which likely results from multiple known and novel putative gene mutations affecting bone development and ossification. ||||| When a bizarre six-inch skeleton was discovered buried in a leather pouch behind an abandoned church in the Atacama Desert of Chile in 2003, it baffled the world.      The tiny figure had a cone-shaped head, the bones of a six-year-old and 10 pairs of ribs instead of the usual 12, leading to speculation that its origin could be extraterrestrial.      But now, after detailed genetic analysis of the little mummy - nicknamed ‘Ata’ - scientists have concluded that its home planet is definitely Earth.      Test carried out by experts at Stanford University and the University of California confirmed the skeleton is a human female baby, who suffered an array of genetic mutations and probably did not survive long after birth.      Dr Garry Nolan, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, began the scientific exploration of Ata in 2012, when a friend called saying he might have found an ‘alien.’      “I had heard about this specimen through a friend of mine, there were some extraordinary claims put forward, and I managed to get a picture of it,” said Dr Nolan.      “You can't look at this specimen and not think it's interesting. It's quite dramatic. So I told my friend, 'Look, whatever it is, if it's got DNA, I can do the analysis.\\" ||||| (CNN) A mummified skeleton discovered in Chile's Atacama Desert 15 years ago doesn't look like anyone you've ever met. In fact, some would say it looks, well, alien.      It's a skeletal conundrum made up of perplexing features. It's only 6 inches tall -- but initial estimates of the age of the bones were consistent with a child aged 6 to 8 years.      The long, angular skull, slanted eye sockets and fewer than normal ribs -- 10 pairs rather than the normal 12 -- only deepened the mystery.      Questions surrounding the discovery led to speculation that it was a previously unidentified primate or even an extraterrestrial life form.      The skeleton, dubbed Ata, was featured in TV shows and a documentary, \\"Sirius,\\" in which a UFO researcher attempts to figure out Ata's origins.      Now, the authors of a study based on five years of genomic analysis want to set the record straight: Ata is human, albeit one with multiple bone disease-associated mutations. And they believe that their findings, published Thursday in the journal Genome Research , could help diagnose genetic mutation-based cases for living patients.      Investigating Ata      In 2003, Ata was found in a deserted mining town called La Noria, in Chile's Atacama region. It was thought to be ancient at first, but initial analysis conducted in 2012 proved that the skeleton was only about 40 years old. This meant DNA would still be intact and could be retrieved for study.      The widespread speculation surrounding Ata brought the case to the attention of Gary Nolan, senior author of the new study and professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.      \\"I learned about this through a friend who was interested in the entire area of extraterrestrial life,\\" Nolan wrote in an email. \\"He told me about a documentary coming out ('Sirius' ... you can find it on Netflix now) which was to feature the 'Atacama Humanoid.'      It was claimed that this was possibly the mummy of an alien.      \\"That was a significant claim in and of itself. More shocking though was the picture I was provided that was part of the online publicity. I decided to contact the movie directors (basically on a dare ...) to tell them it was possible to do a sequencing of the specimen (if it had earthly DNA ...) to determine its origin.\\"      Nolan and his colleagues signed a confidentiality agreement, and the directors agreed to report Nolan's findings, even if the results indicated that Ata's DNA was human.      Nolan wanted to study Ata for several reasons. The extraordinary specimen could have been a previously unrecognized primate species, some sort of human deformity or something else entirely. Nolan said he and his colleagues never believed it could be an alien.      They wanted an answer to the basic question: \\"What is it?\\"      DNA analysis would tell the true story. A sample extracted from the bone marrow of Ata's ribs was used to conduct a whole-genome sequence analysis.      It was compared with human and primate genomes and determined to be a human female, probably a fetus, with Chilean ancestry. Although dating initially estimated the bone age of the skeleton at between 6 and 8 years, the researchers found that the remains had a rare bone-aging disorder that made them seem older than the person they belonged to.      At first, 8% of the DNA didn't match with human DNA. Researchers determined that this was because of a degraded sample. An improved analysis matched up to 98%, Nolan said. Given the exposure and age of the skeleton, this wasn't surprising. Then, they moved on to diagnosing the abnormalities.      It's all in the genes      The researchers were looking for what might explain the skeleton's small stature, as well as the abnormal rib count and other bone and skull oddities.      Dr. Atul Butte, another senior author of the study, was brought in to assist with evaluating the genome. Butte, the Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg distinguished professor and director of the Institute for Computational Health Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, treated the analysis as though it were for a patient.      It revealed a number of mutations within seven genes. Together, these created bone and musculoskeletal deformities, like scoliosis, and skeletal dysplasia, known as dwarfism.      \\"There are mutations in many genes, including genes involved with the production of collagen (in our bones and hair), joints, ribs, and arteries,\\" Butte wrote in an email. \\"We know these genes are involved with these processes in human development, but we are still learning what all the other genes in the DNA do.\\"      Although the mutations found within the genes are known to cause bone disease, some of them had not been previously connected to growth or developmental disorders. The combination of genetic mutations explains Ata's appearance, but it's the number of mutations all present in the same specimen that surprised the scientists.      \\"It's rare,\\" Butte said. \\"To our knowledge, no one has ever explained all of these symptoms in a patient before, and the changes in the DNA, or mutations, reflects this.\\"      But what could have caused this number of mutations?      Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.      \\"Many times, genetic diseases are passed on from parents that are carriers,\\" Butte said. \\"In this case, these mutations are so rare that we haven't actually ever seen some of these before, so it's hard to imagine there are carriers out there. We do speculate that the environment where this child was developing might have played a role. The specimen was found in a town with abandoned nitrate mines, and exposure to nitrates might have caused the mutations. But it's only speculation.\\"      No other researchers have seen the remains.      The way Nolan, Butte and their colleagues used their analytical tools to understand the mysteries presented by Ata's skeleton may provide a pathway for analysis of multiple genes to discover the roots of mutations.      Butte said he hopes that the technology and tools used in this study can help patients and their families receive diagnoses quicker, as well as helping to develop treatments for conditions that can be traced to genetic mutations.      \\"Many children's hospitals now see patients or children with unusual syndromes, including those never described before,\\" Butte said.      \\"DNA sequencing is now more commonly used to help us solve these 'undiagnosed diseases.' But many times, we tend to search for a single gene mutation that might explain what we see in the patient.      \\"What this case taught me we that sometimes there might actually be more than one major DNA difference involved in explaining a particularly hard-to-explain patient. We shouldn't stop a search when we've found the first relevant mutation; indeed there might be many others also involved.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The Atacama humanoid skeleton (nicknamed 'Ata'), discovered over a decade ago in Chile, sparked speculation about extraterrestrial life due to its unusual physical attributes including a 6-inch stature, fewer ribs than a standard human, an elongated cranium, and indicators of accelerated bone age. However, detailed genetic analysis performed by scientists from Stanford University and the University of California determined that Ata was a human female with mutations in several genes (COL1A1, COL2A1, KMT2D, FLNB, ATR, TRIP11, PCNT) related to disorders causing small stature, rib anomalies, cranial malformations, premature joint fusion and osteochondrodysplasia. These disorders gave the specimen its peculiar phenotype. The DNA sample used was extracted from Ata's bone marrow and through a whole-genome sequence analysis, it was found to be of likely Chilean descent. Further analysis also pointed to the presence of a rare bone-aging disorder and numerous genetic mutations not previously associated with growth or developmental disorders. The high number of mutations in Ata remains a mystery, but researchers speculate that the environment could have played a role — for instance, the abandoned nitrate mines where Ata was found may have caused the mutations. The analysis of Ata provides a pathway to further investigate the root cause of mutations and to help diagnose rare conditions in living patients."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Sentence 1: In the lungs, bicarbonate is transported back into the red blood cells in exchange for chloride. Sentence 2: It is a transporter that simultaneously transports chloride and bicarbonate ions from inside the cell to the outside. A:","output":"To complete this task, I will analyze both statements and determine whether Statement 2 entails or implies Statement 1. I will provide my output based on this analysis. Step 1: Understand Statement 1 Statement 1 states that in the lungs, bicarbonate is transported back into the red blood cells in exchange for chloride. Step 2: Understand Statement 2 Statement 2 states that it is a transporter that simultaneously transports chloride and bicarbonate ions from inside the cell to the outside. Step 3: Compare and analyze both statements Both statements discuss the transportation of bicarbonate and chloride ions. However, Statement 1 specifically mentions that this process occurs in the lungs and involves bicarbonate being transported back into red blood cells in exchange for chloride. Statement 2, on the other hand, generically discusses a transporter that moves chloride and bicarbonate ions from inside the cell to the outside. The latter statement does not specify the context in which this transportation occurs (i.e., in the lungs or involving red blood cells). Step 4: Provide output based on analysis Since Statement 2 does not specifically support the context provided in Statement 1 (i.e., the process occurring in the lungs and involving red blood cells), the output is 'neutral'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.  Which temperature will result in slower decay of the cupcakes? Answer:","output":"Storing the cupcakes at 0° F will result in slower decay compared to storing them at 10° F.  Freezing food, including cupcakes, slows down the growth of microorganisms and enzyme activity, both of which contribute to spoilage. Lower temperatures further reduce these processes, extending the shelf life of the cupcakes. In general, the lower the temperature, the slower the decay. Since 0° F is lower than 10° F, storing the cupcakes at 0° F would cause them to decay slower, preserving their quality and freshness for a longer period. However, it is essential to ensure that the cupcakes are stored properly, either in airtight containers or wrapped securely to prevent freezer burn and flavor loss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Emme voi nykymaailmassa aloittaa mitään luomatta uutta akronyymiä. Translate to English","output":"In today's world, we cannot begin anything without creating a new acronym. In the contemporary era, we often find that acronyms play a significant role in a variety of facets in our lives. Be it in the fields of business, science, technology, or even casual conversation, acronyms have become an integral part of our communication process. They serve as convenient shorthand and can expedite the conveyance of information. The primary purpose of using acronyms is to simplify complex terms or phrases, making them easier to remember, and saving time and effort when discussing or writing about specific topics. Acronyms are also valuable in breaking down linguistic barriers, as they allow people from diverse linguistic backgrounds to communicate more effectively by using a common, abbreviated language. For instance, in the field of technology, acronyms such as \\"AI\\" (Artificial Intelligence), \\"IoT\\" (Internet of Things), and \\"CPU\\" (Central Processing Unit) save time and make it easier for people to stay updated on technological advancements. In business, acronyms like \\"B2B\\" (Business-to-Business) and \\"KPI\\" (Key Performance Indicator) help professionals discuss complex concepts with more clarity and speed. Moreover, acronyms can also contribute to a sense of camaraderie and shared understanding amongst individuals within specific communities or industries. People who work or participate in a particular domain can easily understand and use these acronyms, fostering a sense of belonging to a certain group. Furthermore, the use of acronyms can streamline discussions for people in fast-paced environments. For example, medical professionals often rely on acronyms to discuss diagnoses, treatments, and procedures more efficiently. Acronyms like \\"CPR\\" (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) and \\"EMR\\" (Electronic Medical Records) allow doctors and nurses to share vital information with one another quickly and effectively, which can ultimately save lives. However, it is also important to recognize that the excessive or inappropriate use of acronyms can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. When people from different disciplines or industries engage in conversation, it is crucial to ensure that the acronyms being used are clear and easily understood by all parties involved. In some cases, it might be necessary to provide explanations or context, particularly in cross-disciplinary interactions. In conclusion, the prevalence of acronyms in today's world signifies their undeniable role in facilitating effective communication across various domains. While the creation of new acronyms may seem commonplace, it is essential to acknowledge their significance in simplifying complex concepts, bridging linguistic gaps, fostering a sense of community, and streamlining interactions. As we continue to innovate and explore new avenues, it is likely that the use of acronyms will endure as a vital and indispensable component of modern communication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.

The alcohol caused his blood vessels to dilate and stimulated nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood, creating a sensation of warmth.

So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already.

Question: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Where was Manny driving?

Possible answers: cancel the appointment, call the doctor, wasn't feeling good Answer:","output":"Before Quinn made an appointment for his friend Kai at the doctor over the weekend, there are several steps and considerations that Quinn would need to take into account to ensure a smooth and successful scheduling process: 1. Identify the reason for the appointment: First, Quinn needs to know the reason Kai needs an appointment with the doctor. Conversing with Kai, understanding the symptoms, and determining whether the condition is urgent or can wait until a more convenient time could be part of this step. 2. Gather relevant information: Quinn must have accurate and up-to-date information about Kai, including demographic details, insurance coverage, and medical history. This information is necessary for the doctor's office to create or update Kai's patient record and streamline the appointment process. 3. Determine a suitable day and time: In order to make an appointment that fits Kai's schedule, Quinn must be aware of Kai's availability and preferences. This involves talking to Kai about the days and times that are most suitable and discussing whether weekends or weekdays are preferable. 4. Research doctors and clinics: Quinn should spend some time researching doctors and clinics in the area to find the best fit for Kai's needs. This might involve looking at online reviews and checking doctors' credentials to ensure the chosen health care professional is well-suited for Kai's situation. 5. Call the doctor's office to schedule the appointment: Once Quinn has gathered all the necessary information and found an appropriate doctor, the next step is to call the doctor's office to schedule the appointment. Quinn must provide the details about Kai and the reason for the appointment, as well as the preferred date and time for the visit. If the desired time slot is not available, Quinn should be prepared to adjust and find an alternative that suits Kai's schedule. 6. Verify the appointment: After scheduling the appointment, it is important for Quinn to confirm the details, including the appointment date, time, and location, with both Kai and the doctor's office. This helps to avoid misunderstandings or errors that may cause scheduling issues later on. 7. Follow up with Kai: Lastly, Quinn should follow up with Kai to ensure they are aware of the appointment details and understand any preparations they must make, such as fasting before a blood test or bringing specific documents to the appointment. In conclusion, making a doctor's appointment for a friend like Kai involves several steps and thorough preparation, such as gathering relevant information, researching doctors and clinics, and scheduling and verifying the appointment.

I told him “no thank you, I do not drink”. My arm was laying on top of the booth because I was sitting sideways since my big old pregnant belly would not fit under the table. He reached over and took my hand and said “ Come dance with me then”. I again told him I was not interested in dancing. He began to squeeze my hand and insisting I get up and dance with him. I kept telling him no, and pointing to my belly and saying I would not be dancing with anyone. He just kept squeezing my hand harder and trying to pull me out of the booth. I got angry when I felt something break in my hand and screamed at him “Get your effing hands off me!” The bar owner came over to see what the problem was. I explained that “this jerk just hurt my hand because I would not drink or dance with him!” The owner looked at me crying, and the man laughing, and kicked my friend and I out of the place!

Write an article based on this summary: Brazil's national truth commission says illegal arrests, torture, executions and forced disappearances were performed systematically by state agents under Brazil's military rule. Article:","output":"Title: Brazil's National Truth Commission Uncovers Atrocities Committed During Military Rule Introduction Brazil's national truth commission has recently released a report on the systematic human rights abuses that took place during the country's military dictatorship, which lasted from 1964 to 1985. The findings reveal a horrifying history of illegal arrests, torture, executions, and forced disappearances, all performed systematically by state agents. The report not only sheds light on the actions of the Brazilian government during this period but also poses important questions about accountability and how Brazil can move forward in acknowledging and addressing this dark chapter in its history. Systematic Human Rights Abuses by State Agents According to the national truth commission's report, the abuses carried out by state agents were systematic and widespread during Brazil's military rule. The military regime, in its efforts to suppress dissent and maintain power, employed a wide range of tactics to instill fear and silence critics. State agents were responsible for numerous human rights violations, including illegal arrests of citizens without warrants or just cause, torture of political prisoners to extract information or confessions, and execution of those who were considered threats to the regime. Not only did state agents commit these crimes, but they also facilitated forced disappearances by hiding the bodies of victims, thereby making it difficult for families to find closure and justice. The commission's findings show that high-level officials were aware of these atrocities, and in some instances, directly ordered them, revealing a systemic level of complicity within the Brazilian government. Confronting Brazil's Past in the Pursuit of Justice and Healing The report from the national truth commission comes at an important time for Brazil, as the country grapples with its past and questions of accountability. The Brazilian government has yet to fully acknowledge the extent of human rights violations committed during the military dictatorship, and no one has been prosecuted or held accountable for these crimes. The amnesty law, enacted in 1979, has protected state agents from facing criminal charges, perpetuating a cycle of impunity. As the nation confronts its past, the Brazilian government must take steps to address these atrocities, promote justice, and facilitate healing for those affected by the military dictatorship. Initiatives can include overturning the amnesty law, establishing a mechanism for victims and their families to pursue restitution, and strengthening national institutions to prevent such occurrences in the future. Conclusion The report from Brazil's national truth commission is a stark reminder of the systematic human rights abuses committed by state agents during the country's military rule. The findings highlight the need for accountability, justice, and healing in order for Brazil to fully move forward from this dark period in its history. By addressing these injustices, Brazil can foster a national dialogue on human rights and democracy, ensuring that such atrocities never occur again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Do you always forget where you placed your keys or your purse? What was the name of the movie you saw last week? The major cause of your forgetfulness may be linked to what you store in your body, not in your short-term memory bank. Tests continue to show that people with enough Vitamin B-2 do well in memory exams. The \\"B\\" could stand for \\"brain\\", if you're one of many with limited instant recall. And the number one source of that vitamin   is sunflower seeds. Even when you're sleeping or relaxing, your brain is still at work. Although it makes up just two percent of your total body weight, it uses up to 30 % of the calories   you take in each day. For it to work properly, it must be fed. Even if you're not a breakfast eater, that meal is the best way to prepare your brain for the day. A quick and easy English _ with peanut and butter in it, a glass of milk, and an orange, might be what your brain may be asking you the first thing in the morning when you feel your head is in a fog. Having sunflower seeds and fruit between meals adds more muscle to that hungry, demanding organ. Vitamin B-1 also helps the memory, and that is found in eggs, meats and nuts. In Chinese culture, walnuts are known as the fruit for a long life because it is believed that they feed both the kidneys and the brain. And according to Chinese culture, if you keep those two important organs in good working order, you'll live longer. However forgetful you are, just keep in mind the letter \\"B\\", which will help you to \\"bear in mind almost everything\\" even on those days when life's challenges are sending you in a billion directions. Question: What can we conclude from the passage? Options: A: Two percent of our brain is still active when we are sleeping or relaxing. B: What we eat seems more important than what we learn in terms of memory. C: It doesn't make much difference to our brain whether we have breakfast or not. D: Life's challenges have no effect on our memory, if dealt with in a proper way. Answer:","output":"B: What we eat seems more important than what we learn in terms of memory.

Step 2: Evaluate each option based on the information provided in the article. Option A: The article states that the brain uses up to 30% of the calories taken in each day, not that 2% of the brain is still active during sleep or relaxation. This option is incorrect. Option B: The article emphasizes the importance of specific nutrients in maintaining and improving memory. This option is consistent with the main point of the article. Option C: The article suggests that having breakfast is crucial for providing the brain with the energy it needs to function well throughout the day. This option contradicts the article's information, making it incorrect. Option D: The article does not explicitly discuss the effect of life's challenges on memory when dealt with in a proper manner. This option is not supported by the information in the text. Conclusion: Option B is the most accurate conclusion based on the information provided in the passage. The article focuses on the importance of specific nutrients and foods for memory, highlighting that our diet may play a more crucial role in memory improvement than the information we try to learn."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Soon after composing \\"Halo\\", Tedder worked with Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted (2009), for which they wrote \\"Already Gone\\" together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's \\"Halo\\". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent \\"Already Gone\\" from being included on All I Ever Wanted, but it was impossible to make last minute changes, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce was released. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder commented that he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her criticism was \\"hurtful and absurd\\". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different. Calling \\"Already Gone\\" one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to \\"listen [to the two ballads] and form their own opinions\\". Clarkson also tried to stop her label, RCA, from releasing \\"Already Gone\\" as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, \\"It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it.\\" Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.

For the third time in less than 24 hours, F-16 fighter jets were scrambled Thursday to escort a hapless pilot out of a restricted area in place for President Obama's visit to Los Angeles. Fighter jets intercepted a single-engine Cherokee Piper around 9:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) minutes after intercepting a Cessna for the same violation. Hours earlier, fighter jets intercepted a single-engine airplane northwest of Los Angeles for breaching a temporary airspace restriction, according to a military news release. The Federal Aviation Administration investigates all violations of restricted airspace, and FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer told CNN the agency is investigating the three cases over Los Angeles. Pilots refer to the area off limits to general aviation as a \\"temporary flight restriction\\" or TFR. The FAA keeps an up-to-date list of restricted airspace on its website, something pilots are supposed to check prior to departure. The penalties for violating restricted airspace can be severe according to the FAA. Pilots face possible suspension or loss of their pilot's license. Not all aircraft are equal when it comes to restricted air space. Commercial flights are in contact with the FAA during their flights and have a flight plan, so they're allowed to fly into and out of the cordoned-off area, according to the FAA. Police helicopters and air ambulance aircraft are also permitted in the no-fly zone. Flight restriction orders are usually put in place surrounding stadiums during large sporting events, scenes of natural disasters and areas around the president's movements.

Information:  - A communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy. The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide.  - The South African Communist Party (SACP) is a communist party in South Africa. It was founded in 1921, was declared illegal in 1950, and participated in the struggle against apartheid. It is a partner of the Tripartite Alliance with the African National Congress and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and through this influences the South African government.  - African Communist is the magazine of the South African Communist Party, published quarterly. The magazine was started by a group of Marxist-Leninists in 1959. It has its headquarters in Johannesburg.  - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is a trade union federation in South Africa. It was founded in 1985 and is the largest of the countrys three main trade union federations, with 21 affiliated trade unions, altogether organising 1.8 million workers.  - The Tripartite Alliance is an alliance between the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP). The ANC holds a majority in the South African parliament, while the SACP and COSATU have not contested any democratic election in South Africa.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Moses Mncane Mabhida ( 11 October 1923 -- 8 March 1986 ) was a South African politician . Mabhida was leader of the South African Communist Party from 1978 until his death in 1986 .  - The African National Congress (ANC) is the Republic of South Africa's governing social democratic political party. It has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa on the national level, beginning with the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994 election, the first election after the end of apartheid. Today, the ANC remains the dominant political party in South Africa, winning every election since 1994. Its leader Jacob Zuma is the incumbent president of South Africa.   - Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa between 1948 and 1991, when it was abolished. The country's first multiracial elections under a universal franchise were held three years later in 1994. Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into \\"petty apartheid\\", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and \\"grand apartheid\\", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some vestiges of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid as a policy was embraced by the South African government shortly after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the country's 1948 general elections.

A survey of 441 practices in Scotland found more than half have seen no investment in the last 10 years. The Scottish government has said its programme of investment in primary health care facilities is one of the largest of its kind. But BMA Scotland's Dr Alan McDevitt said: \\"We need investment that enables GPs to provide 21st century healthcare in 21st century buildings.\\" The key findings from the BMA survey indicate: Dr McDevitt added: \\"Not only is general practice bursting at the seams, but the buildings where we provide care for our patients are crumbling. \\"A number of health centres have been rebuilt in recent years, but the vast majority of GPs and their staff are struggling by in buildings that are not fit for purpose. \\"New ways of getting funding for GP premises are now urgently required. \\"In order to achieve the government's intention to shift care out of hospitals and into local communities, they need to build the capacity to enable general practice to provide this care.\\" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \\"The Scottish government is investing Â£250m in community-based health facilities across Scotland through the hub programme, which represents one of the largest ever investments of its kind in the NHS estate. \\"During 2013, over Â£65m worth of new health and medical centres were completed and opened, including facilities in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.\\" She added: \\"We will continue to work with a range of stakeholders, including the BMA, to ensure primary care services continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of the people of Scotland.\\" Perthshire GP Dr Claire Hutton said her building has consistently failed infection control inspections because of a lack of investment. She said: \\"The building is outdated and in need of repair and renovation. \\"There is limited practice space and we are unable to expand as there is no more room. \\"Our practice list is growing and this has placed increased pressure on rooms and staff. \\"Where we have flagged up the need for improvement measures on grounds of safety, for example for reception staff, we have been told there is no money available.\\"","output":"The article discusses the lack of investment in primary health care facilities in Scotland, resulting in inability to provide adequate appointments for patients and deteriorating infrastructure of the health centers. A survey conducted on 441 practices in Scotland highlighted that over half of these practices had not seen any investment in the past decade. This has led to growing concern and critique from professionals such as Dr. Alan McDevitt from BMA Scotland, who emphasized the need for investment that enables GPs to deliver 21st-century healthcare in appropriate facilities.  McDevitt further stated that many general practices are overcrowded, and the buildings are in crumbling condition. Despite some health centers being rebuilt, the majority are still operating in buildings unfit for purpose. He stressed the urgent need for new funding methods for GP premises to meet the government's intention of shifting care from hospitals to local communities.  In response, a spokeswoman from the Scottish Government pointed out that the government had invested £250m in community-based health facilities across Scotland through the hub programme, marking one of the largest-ever investments in the NHS estate. She confirmed that during 2013, over £65m worth of new health and medical centers were completed and opened in cities including Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen. The government also affirmed its commitment to continue working with stakeholders, including the BMA, to ensure the primary care services evolve to meet the changing needs of the Scottish people.  Nevertheless, issues in local practices persist, as exemplified by Dr. Claire Hutton, a GP from Perthshire, whose building consistently failed infection control inspections due to limited investments. She outlined the building's dire need for repair, renovation and its inability to expand due to lack of space, which is increasingly pressurized as the practice's list of patients grows. Although they identified the need for improvement measures on grounds of safety, including for reception staff, they were informed that no funds are available to facilitate these changes. Thus, the issue of inadequate investment in primary healthcare facilities extends beyond the lack of appointments and deteriorating buildings, to broader challenges including patient safety and staff working conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are an English electronic music band formed in Wirral, Merseyside in 1978. Spawned by earlier group The Id, the outfit is composed of co-founders Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), along with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Stuart Kershaw (drums); McCluskey is the only constant member. OMD released their debut single, \\"Electricity\\", in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song \\"Enola Gay\\". During 1988 the band appeared poised to consolidate their US success, with a support slot for Depeche Mode's Music for the Masses Tour at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on 18 June 1988, a top 20 US hit with \\"Dreaming\\" and a successful \\"Best of\\" album. However, it was at this point when OMD broke in two. Graham and Neil Weir left at the end of the 1988 US tour and co-founder Paul Humphreys subsequently called it a day, unhappy with the band's commercial orientation. Finally, Cooper and Holmes left OMD to join Humphreys in founding a new band called The Listening Pool in 1989.  This left only McCluskey to carry on, essentially becoming a solo artist working under the OMD banner. McCluskey's first album from the new OMD was the dance-pop Sugar Tax LP in May 1991, which charted at No. 3 in the UK. McCluskey recruited in 1989 Liverpool musicians Raw Unlimited (aka Lloyd Massett, Stuart Kershaw and Nathalie Loates) as collaborators for the making of Sugar Tax: writing credits carefully distinguished between songs written by OMD (i.e., McCluskey) and songs written by OMD/Kershaw/Massett. This iteration of the group was initially successful with hits like \\"Sailing on the Seven Seas\\" and \\"Pandora's Box\\", with lesser success on fellow chart entries, \\"Call My Name\\" and \\"Then You Turn Away\\". McCluskey's live band was then formed by Nigel Ipinson (keyboards), Phil Coxon (keyboards) and Abe Juckes (drums) since late 1990. Kershaw, Ipinson and Coxon from 1992 to 1996 contributed to OMD albums and a 1993 tour.  The fifth track from Liberator (1993), \\"Dream of Me\\", was built around a sample from \\"Love's Theme\\" by Love Unlimited Orchestra, a track which was written and produced by Barry White. To release the \\"Dream of Me\\" track as an OMD single, however, McCluskey had to agree that the single release of the track would remove the actual \\"Love's Theme\\" sample, but still be officially titled \\"Dream of Me (Based on Love's Theme)\\", and furthermore would still give a writing credit to White. Paul Humphreys, while no longer part of the group, co-wrote the single \\"Everyday\\".  Also in 1993, McCluskey made contributions to the Esperanto album, a project by former Kraftwerk member Karl Bartos (then working under the moniker of Elektric Music).  McCluskey returned with a rotating cast of musicians for the 1996 album Universal, which featured two songs co-written by Humphreys as well as a holdover from the Esperanto sessions, co-penned by Bartos. The record spawned OMD's first Top 20 hit in five years, \\"Walking on the Milky Way\\".

If There is strong evidence that readiness to change and confidence, especially before treatment, are unrelated., can we conclude that \\"There is no correlation between confidence and preparedness to change.\\"?","output":"If there is strong evidence that readiness to change and confidence, particularly before treatment, are not related, it is important to analyze various aspects of this evidence and the context surrounding these two factors before concluding that \\"There is no correlation between confidence and preparedness to change.\\" While it may be tempting to draw a definitive conclusion from the available evidence, there are numerous considerations to take into account when evaluating the relationship between confidence and readiness to change. First, it's crucial to define and understand the terms \\"confidence\\" and \\"readiness to change.\\" Confidence refers to an individual's belief in their ability to successfully perform a specific task or achieve a certain goal. In contrast, readiness to change refers to the individual's willingness to take necessary steps to modify their behavior or mindset to achieve a desired outcome. In the context of treatment, readiness to change often pertains to individuals' willingness to engage in therapeutic interventions and comply with treatment recommendations. Next, it is important to consider the nature of the evidence indicating no relationship between confidence and readiness to change. This evidence may come from various sources, such as research studies, observations of individuals undergoing treatment, or expert opinions in the field. When evaluating these sources of evidence, it is essential to examine the methodology, sample size, and other relevant factors that may impact the reliability and validity of the conclusions drawn. It is also crucial to consider the context in which the evidence is provided. The relationship between confidence and readiness to change may differ across various settings, populations, or treatment types. For example, the correlation may be different for people seeking treatment for substance abuse, mental health disorders, or chronic health conditions. Moreover, individual factors, such as personality traits, cultural background, or previous experiences, may influence the relationship between confidence and readiness to change. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the potential presence of confounding variables that may impact the relationship between confidence and readiness to change. Confounding variables are factors that are related to both variables under examination and may provide an alternative explanation for the observed association between them. If such variables are present but uncontrolled for, they may lead to false conclusions regarding the correlation between confidence and readiness to change. Lastly, it is necessary to take a closer look at the temporal aspect of the apparently unrelated nature of confidence and readiness to change. The evidence might be showing that confidence and readiness to change are not related before treatment, but this doesn't necessarily mean they are unrelated throughout the treatment process. As individuals progress through the treatment, their levels of confidence may change, potentially influencing their readiness to change. In conclusion, while strong evidence that readiness to change and confidence are not related before treatment may suggest a potential lack of correlation between the two factors, drawing definitive conclusions requires careful consideration of the various aspects mentioned above. It is important to critically analyze the evidence, assess the context and confounding variables, and explore potential changes in the relationship over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Incorporating economic aspects in the cohesion policy ensures a strong foundation for the efficient allocation of resources, as well as the promotion of policies and initiatives that bolster economic growth and productivity. Social aspects, on the other hand, involve factors such as education, healthcare, social inclusion, and income distribution. These elements are equally important in fostering a harmonious and inclusive society, where all individuals have access to essential services, can improve their skills, and can participate in the labor market effectively. By addressing social aspects within the cohesion policy, the Europe 2020 strategy aims to reduce poverty, mitigate social exclusion, and ensure equal opportunities for disadvantaged groups, including minorities, women, and people with disabilities. Territorial aspects pertain to the geographic characteristics and specific regional challenges that need to be acknowledged and addressed in order to create balanced and sustainable development across the European Union. This includes understanding and tackling issues related to urbanization, spatial planning, transportation, and accessibility to services. It also entails recognizing the unique strengths, resources, and opportunities present in various regions, as well as promoting cross-border cooperation and synergies between different areas. Integrating territorial aspects in the cohesion policy ensures that the particularities of each region are considered, leading to tailor-made interventions and development plans. In conclusion, it is essential that all three aspects - economic, social, and territorial - be woven into the fabric of the Europe 2020 strategy through a comprehensive cohesion policy. This holistic approach will ensure a more balanced, inclusive, and prosperous European Union, where all regions and populations can grow, thrive, and benefit from shared resources and opportunities."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Options: a ) 79 kmph , b ) 80 kmph , c ) 34 kmph , d ) 23 kmph , e ) 14 kmph","output":"The average speed of a car can be calculated using the formula:  Average speed = (Total distance) / (Total time) In the given problem, the car traveled 70 km in the first hour and 90 km in the second hour. So, the total distance would be the sum of these distances: Total distance = 70 km + 90 km = 160 km The total time taken is 2 hours (1 hour for the first part and 1 hour for the second part).  Now, we can calculate the average speed: Average speed = (160 km) / (2 hours) = 80 kmph Hence, the answer is b) 80 kmph."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected? Options:  A. Because she thought the other actress did a bad job  B. Because she was treated like a liar  C. not enough information  D. Because the role had to be changed for the new actress Answer:","output":"B. Because she was treated like a liar"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let's analyze each sentence to understand their meanings: Sentence 1: \\"He only lost 3 and he has also saved two games.\\" In this sentence, it is mentioned that the person lost 3 games and managed to save 2 games. When saying \\"only lost 3,\\" it emphasizes that the person lost a relatively small number of games. The use of \\"also\\" in the second part of the sentence suggests that, in addition to losing 3 games, the person successfully saved 2 games. Sentence 2: \\"He also saved 3 and he only lost two games.\\" This sentence states that the person saved 3 games and lost only 2 games. Here, the emphasis is on \\"only lost two games,\\" which implies that losing 2 games was a minor issue compared to the 3 games that the person managed to save. The use of \\"also\\" in this sentence conveys the same meaning as in Sentence 1; it adds the fact that the person saved 3 games in addition to losing 2 games. To sum up, the information conveyed in the two sentences is different in terms of the number of games lost and saved. Sentence 1 states that the person lost 3 and saved 2 games, while Sentence 2 mentions that the person lost 2 and saved 3 games.

(Associated Press)      Philip Chism, 14, was charged with murder Wednesday in the death of Colleen Ritzer, a 24-year-old math teacher at Danvers High School.      Rania Rhaddaoui sat two seats away from Chism in Ritzer's Algebra I class, the final class of the school day. She said Chism was drawing in a notebook rather than taking notes Tuesday.      \\"She came over and said, \`I didn't know you draw,' and he said, \`yes,' then later on, she said, \`Can you stay after with me?'\\" Rhaddaoui said. \\"Obviously, he stayed after because when I was leaving, he was still at his desk.\\"      She said Ritzer had scheduled a test for Friday, but she was unsure why exactly Ritzer asked Chism to stay after school.      Ritzer never returned home that day. Blood in a second-floor bathroom helped lead investigators to her body, which was dumped in the woods behind the school in a close-knit community about 20 miles north of Boston.      Chism was picked up by police in the early morning hours Wednesday, walking along Route 1 in neighboring Topsfield. His attorney declined to comment outside court Wednesday and did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday.      The high school remained closed for classes Thursday, but grief counselors were on hand to offer comfort to students.      Kaitlyn Nash, 16, went to the school to be with her friends. She said students who knew and loved Ritzer were still trying to make sense of what happened. She said she found it particularly frightening that she had theater rehearsal Tuesday afternoon and was at the school when authorities believe Ritzer was killed.      \\"It's just terrifying,\\" she said. \\"I know a lot of people don't want to go back to school at this point. I know we have to, and we just need to get on with.\\"      Classes were expected to resume Friday.      Authorities offered no clues Thursday on Chism's alleged motive. They also would not say how Ritzer was killed.      Carrie Kimball-Monahan, a spokeswoman for Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett, said the case was still being investigated.      Chism had moved to Massachusetts from Tennessee before the start of the school year and was a top scorer on the school's junior varsity soccer team.      Jean McCartin, a Danvers School Committee member, said the school has extensive programs to help ease the transition for new students who may have problems but there was no information about Chism that would have presented any red flags.      \\"He just presented himself to us like any other student would,\\" she said Thursday. \\"And that's what I think is so hard for the administration right now. You know, their hearts are breaking because they just didn't know he was in need, if he was in need. ... No one knows why he would have behaved in this way and done such a terrible thing.\\"      Students were also puzzled. Chism's teammates on the soccer team have said he was soft-spoken and nonviolent.      Rhaddaoui said Chism was quiet, and she never saw him raise his hand in math class. She said they were also in the same history class, where he told classmates he spoke three languages: English, Portuguese and Japanese.      Mark Nolan, of Clarksville, Tenn., who coached Chism in a local youth soccer program for several years when Chism was 9 or 10, said there was nothing unusual about him.      \\"He didn't stand out; he wasn't a troublemaker,\\" Nolan said. \\"He had no problem with other kids. He wasn't overly aggressive.\\"      Nolan recalled that Chism's father was in the military and his mother was a social worker. Both parents attended their son's soccer matches, Nolan said.      Caio Silva, a Danvers High School senior and varsity soccer player, said he knew both Chism and Ritzer. He said he and his teammates are helping each other.      \\"A lot of the guys are really shocked, a lot of guys are down, really upset,\\" he said.      \\"It's just really sad,\\" he said. \\"A lady that was really sweet and a kid who was really sweet. It just doesn't really match up. It's really sad.\\"      The manager of Hollywood Hits Theatres in Danvers said Chism went to the theater late Tuesday afternoon and bought a ticket to see Woody Allen's new movie, \\"Blue Jasmine.\\"      Scott Przybycien said police came to the theater Tuesday night and said they had information that Chism had been at the theater. Przybycien said the theater's surveillance video showed Chism entering the theater at about 4:15 p.m., paying 8.00 in cash for a movie ticket, then leaving the building at about 6:15 p.m., after the movie ended. Authorities believe Ritzer was killed after school ended at about 2 p.m., but they have not released a specific time.      \\"He didn't stand out in any way,\\" Przybycien said. \\"There was no reason for any business to be concerned. He looked like a normal, everyday customer coming in to watch a movie.\\"      Ritzer was described as an enthusiastic, caring teacher who stood outside her classroom and said hello to all students, whether they were in her classes or not.      \\"She was very approachable,\\" Rhaddaoui said. \\"She was always smiling. She always made the best of every situation.\\"      Ritzer's family released a statement Thursday, asking the media to respect their privacy as they make arrangements \\"to celebrate Colleen's vibrant life.\\"      Chism appeared briefly in court Wednesday for arraignment on a murder charge and was ordered held without bail.      Ritzer was the second teacher allegedly killed by a student in the U.S. this week. A Sparks, Nev., middle school teacher was shot Monday, allegedly by a 12-year-old student.      ___      Associated Press writers Denise Lavoie in Boston and Travis Loller in Clarksville, Tenn., contributed to this report. ||||| DANVERS — The high school math teacher who was allegedly slain by a 14-year-old student asked the student to stay after school on the day she was killed because she wanted to help him with an upcoming test, a student in the class said today.      Student Rania Rhaedaoui said she was in Colleen Ritzer’s algebra class on the last period of the day on Tuesday, along with the suspect, Philip Chism.      “She saw him drawing during class and she just said to him, ‘I didn’t know you could draw,’” said Rhaedaoui, a 14-year-old freshman.      Advertisement - Continue Reading Below      “I sit really close to him, so I could hear,” she said.      Rhaedaoui said she later heard Ritzer ask Chism to stay after school.      “She just said, ‘Can you stay after with me?’ He just gave a nod.”      “There was a test coming up, and she wanted to know if he had any questions on learning equations,” Rhaedaoui said.      Cambria Cloutier, another 14-year-old freshman, who was also in the class, said she walked by Ritzer’s classroom at about 3:15 p.m., more than an hour after the class had gotten out at 1:55 p.m. “She was standing at her computer, and he was just sitting there,” Cloutier said. “It just looked normal, like any other day.”      Chism, who moved to Danvers this summer from Tennessee, was ordered held without bail Thursday in the death of Ritzer, 24, who was recalled as a natural teacher devoted to her students.      Ritzer’s body was found early Wednesday morning in the woods behind the school. Few details of Chism’s alleged crime, including his possible motive, have been disclosed by investigators, and they declined comment today.      Also today, a Danvers movie theater manager said Chism had watched a movie after school Tuesday at Hollywood Hits, a six-screen complex on Endicott Street.      Scott Przybycien said Chism came into the building at 4:15 p.m. Chism paid 8 in cash for a ticket to the 4:30 p.m. showing of “Blue Jasmine,” a Woody Allen film.      “He sat alone in Theater Two,” said Przybycien. Chism, who was caught on the theater’s surveillance video, was dressed in a sweatsuit, and did not purchase any concessions, Przybycien said. Chism did not say or do anything to draw attention to himself, Przybycien said.      “There was nothing about his manner, or the way he was dressed, that stood out. A teen dressed in a sweatsuit is not unusual here,” he added. Chism left the theater about 6:15 p.m., the manager said.      The school reopened today, offering grief counseling for students and families. Students arrived in shock and in tears. “There were people in the school, and no one, like, knew it was happening,” Amanda Finn, 18, said as she arrived.      Finn said Ritzer was not one of her teachers, but she had a cheery presence.      “She was so nice. She would see you in the hall and say, ‘Hey, great outfit!’” Finn said.      Finn said she came to school to support the teachers. “I know so many of them were friends with her,” she said.      Other schools in the town were to operate normally, according to a statement released Wednesday by School Superintendent Lisa Dana. The high school is expected to resume its normal schedule on Friday.      Officials also scheduled an informational meeting for 6:30 p.m. in the school’s field house.      Orange leaves littered the grass in front of the high school, under trees reduced to bare branches. A clutch of black balloons was tied to the blue-and-gold school sign out front. Pink ribbons — pink was said to be Ritzer’s favorite color — were tied to tree trunks.      A memorial left over from a candlelight vigil attended by hundreds on Wednesday night included pink and white candles and handwritten condolence notes. One note said, “Another Angel Gone Too Soon.” Another said, “RIP Colleen Ritzer.”      A Red Sox teddy bear lay next to a pot of yellow mums. Roses wrapped in cellophane, and other tokens, such as a small stuffed pink whale, were also included. The flag flew at half-staff and the electronic message board in front of the school displayed another tweet by Ritzer: “No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy.”      June McEachern arrived at the school with her son, Kyle, a sophomore, for grief counseling.      “As a parent, I don’t know how to console” a child through such a tragedy, she said. ”What can you say to a child?” She hopes the counseling provides guidance about how “to make the best of a bad, bad situation.”      Nicole White, a freshman who had Ritzer for geometry, said Chism was in her biology and history classes.      “He was just really quiet,” said White.      She said Ritzer was “gentle and sweet . . . She wanted the best for everyone.”      Sarah Roach, 14, another freshman who had Ritzer for geometry, said she hoped the counseling “will make us feel more comfortable going back to school” on Friday.      “I’m kind of nervous about going back to [Ritzer’s] classroom,” Roach said. Roach said Ritzer had a fun, light-hearted approach to teaching geometry.      “She’d say things like ‘Yay, more proofs today!’” Roach recalled.      A spokeswoman for Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett, whose office is overseeing the murder investigation, said prosecutors would not be commenting on the case, except through court filings.      “This is an active and very fluid investigation, and it is inappropriate for me to make any comments about the possible findings of that investigation while it is ongoing,’’ said Carrie Kimball Monahan.      She said that no additional charges had been filed against Chism – who faces a single count of first-degree murder – and no one else has been arrested.      “I am not going to make any comments on any evidence that we have found,’’ she said in a brief telephone interview.      Ritzer was reported missing at about 11:20 p.m. Tuesday when she did not return home and did not answer her cellphone. Police went to the high school, where they found blood in a second-floor bathroom, prompting a search of the grounds and the discovery of her body shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday, authorities have said.      Chism was last seen around 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at the theater, police have said. Danvers police issued a tweet, seeking him as a missing child at 9:25 p.m. that night. Chism was found by police in neighboring Topsfield at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, walking north on the southbound side of Route 1.      Chism was the leading scorer on the school’s junior varsity team. Several of Chism’s soccer teammates said he had mysteriously vanished Tuesday afternoon, missing a team practice at 4 p.m. and a team dinner at 6. Teammates last saw the youth running away from the practice field, breathlessly telling them he had something he needed to take care of.      The students said Chism was an amiable, hard-working boy who loved soccer, and who had bonded quickly with his new team.      Chism had moved in recent months from Tennessee to Danvers with his mother and sisters, friends said. His father has remained in Tennessee and has no contact with him, according to his teammates. The teenager had attended school in the Clarksville-Montgomery County school system in Tennessee since fourth grade, except for one year in Florida. He left in May, a school spokeswoman said.      A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said the teacher was stabbed and cut. It appeared, according to the official, that a box cutter was used. The official declined to speak for attribution, citing the sensitivity of the investigation.      In a police report filed in Salem District Court, where Chism was arraigned Wednesday as an adult on a charge of first-degree murder, investigators said the teenager “assaulted and subsequently murdered” Ritzer, then disposed of her body. A not-guilty plea was entered on his behalf.      The law enforcement official said surveillance footage from inside the school showed Chism pushing a recycling bin through the hall and outside the building. Authorities are trying to determine if Ritzer’s body was in the bin.      Evidence was found at multiple scenes at the school and the surrounding woods, police said. Police charged Chism after interviewing him and reviewing the footage.      A statement released today by a spokesman for the Ritzer family said, “The Ritzer Family is most grateful for the outpouring of support during this very difficult time.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A 14-year-old student allegedly killed his high school math teacher after she asked him to stay late to help him with an upcoming test.

Q:I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he. What has been bothering the author? - Her marriage had to much fun - not enough information - Her marriage was very normal - Her husband had no passion for her hence their growing lack of intimacy A:","output":"The author has been bothered by the growing lack of intimacy in her marriage, particularly as the frequency of their sexual activity decreased over the years. This issue had led to fights and insecurities, causing the author to question what was wrong with herself that made her husband not want to have sex with her. The discovery of her husband's same-sex attractions, which he had kept secret from her, added feelings of betrayal, confusion, anger, and sadness to her emotional turmoil. Despite these revelations, the author acknowledges the love that she and her husband share and their happiness in their life together, which has led to a complicated internal conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The method mentioned in option I is a more reasonable and effective approach to removing baked-on food from a cooking pan without scrubbing. The use of an unused dryer sheet, along with warm water, can help to soften and loosen the stubborn food particles through its surfactant content. These surfactants, also known as surface-active agents, make the water \\"wetter,\\" enabling it to penetrate and break down the baked-on deposits more efficiently. Allowing the pan to sit overnight is essential to give the warm water and dryer sheet enough time to work on the residue effectively. This process helps to weaken the bond between the food debris and the pan's surface, ultimately allowing you to remove the leftover food residue with ease in the morning. On the other hand, option II seems to have some errors and contains irrelevant terms, such as \\"dryer sheep\\" and \\"baked on towels.\\" Furthermore, it is a less coherent and less structured statement that doesn't provide a clear method for the cleaning process. In conclusion, option I is the better method for cleaning a baking pan with tough, baked-on food without scrubbing. This technique takes advantage of the surfactant properties of an unused dryer sheet to loosen the food residue and ease its removal. It is a practical, environmentally friendly, and efficient approach to tackling baked-on food particles on cooking pans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Picking genders for characters could be the next big thing for emoji According to the common emoji keyboard, women don’t run. Only men run. See? 🏃 But that could soon change under a new draft proposal to the Unicode Consortium, the body that develops and maintains software standards for texts and characters. The document outlines a number of changes, including male, female and neutral gender options for many human-looking characters. If adopted, this would follow Apple’s move last year to unveil a new set of emoji that allows users to pick skin tones, which came after calls for racially diverse emoji. The new gender options would allow, for instance, a male, or female runner: And, the businessman who levitates? Now a businesswoman or businessperson can hover, for some reason. (Seriously, why is this person in a suit hovering?) From Emojipedia: Other changes would allow for customizing hair color to black, blond, brown, red and gray, as well as bald. According to the proposal, the list of hair options come from “the distinctions made in the U.S. Online Passport form, the UN Grounds Pass application, and other forms such as driver’s licenses.” The proposal also includes changing the direction of characters to face left or right and the possibility for some regional flags. Individual companies would still have to implement the changes, if adopted by Unicode, on their platforms. For instance, Google’s Android, which already has a set of gender-neutral emoji, doesn’t allow users to pick skin tones for emoji the way that Apple’s keyboard does. Given the large number of possible combinations, the proposals states that it’s “anticipated that only certain combinations would be supported by major vendors.” “There is no requirement or expectation that all of the possible combinations — or even any large subset of them — be supported by vendors, until there is technology in the fonts to deal with the combinatorics,” it states.

They both search for evidence about the origins of the universe.;...A:","output":"b. They both make discoveries using optical devices. Astronomers and biologists, despite their fields of study being quite different, share the commonality of making discoveries using optical devices. While they focus on entirely distinct subjects, the methods used to observe and analyze their respective subject matters can be quite similar. Astronomers study celestial objects and phenomena in the universe, such as stars, planets, galaxies, black holes, and more. They utilize optical devices like telescopes, which gather light from distant objects and magnify their image, as well as other instruments like spectrometers, which help decode the chemical compositions and physical properties of celestial bodies. This allows them to analyze data, draw conclusions, and make discoveries in the field of astronomy. On the other hand, biologists investigate living organisms and their interactions with the surrounding environment. They study organisms on various scales, from the microscopic level (such as cells and molecules) to the macroscopic level (including ecosystems and global processes). Biologists often employ optical devices like microscopes, which magnify small samples to observe details otherwise invisible to the naked eye. Additionally, techniques like fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy provide them with detailed information about the structure, function, and behaviors of living organisms. In summary, both astronomers and biologists rely on optical devices to make new discoveries and better understand the subjects they study. These devices allow them to extend the limits of human vision, acquire crucial insights into their respective fields, and contribute to the ongoing development of scientific knowledge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In other words, addressing Mrs. Allen by her first name does not lead to the presence of knives within educational institutions. Now, let's examine the hypothesis, \\"We wish to assure you that calling Mrs. Allen Jodie will not cause knives in the schools.\\" This statement essentially conveys the same information as the given premise, but the expression is slightly different. The hypothesis aims to provide reassurance that using the name \\"Jodie\\" for Mrs. Allen will not result in knives appearing in schools. The primary difference between the two statements is that the hypothesis emphasizes the intention to provide assurance and comfort regarding the lack of a causal link. Given that the premise is true, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is also true. Both statements assert in different ways that there is no causal relationship between using Mrs. Allen's first name and the presence of knives in schools. Consequently, the truth of the premise supports the truth of the hypothesis – both are effectively communicating that referring to Mrs. Allen as \\"Jodie\\" will not lead to knives appearing in educational institutions.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us.      Studies have shown. for instance. that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues( ). like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption.       A new study suggested that our shot-term memory also may play a role in appetite.  Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by how much food they'd seen in front of them --- in other words, how much they remembered eating.       This difference suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal. says Jeffrey M . Brunstrom , a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol.     \\"Hunger isn't. controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal.\\" Brunstrom says. \\"This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought.\\"      These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones, depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 0r 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake.      What does this means for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves in to eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food avoiding TV and multitasking while eating.   ...

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_RUN Output:","output":"Part  #1: Understanding the specific actions and their corresponding command. Usage: For example, the action 'I_JUMP' would correspond to the command 'jump'. This is important because building a command from actions requires an understanding of which commands relate to which actions. Part  #2: Incorporating directions into the command. Usage: If the action was 'I_TURN_LEFT', the command would be 'turn left'. This fits into the defined schema because 'left' denotes the direction of the action. Part  #3: Using the term ‘opposite’ to signify the agent turning backward. Usage: An action sequence like 'I_TURN_RIGHT' followed by 'I_TURN_RIGHT' could be equated to the command 'turn left opposite'. This implementation works because turning right twice gets the agent to face in the opposite left direction. Part  #4: Utilizing the word 'around' for making the agent execute an action while turning. Usage: If the sequence was 'I_TURN_RIGHT' and 'I_WALK', this could be represented as 'walk around right'. This is correct because 'around' is used when the agent needs to execute an action while turning. Part  #5: Using ‘and’ to execute another command after the first command. Usage: For example, if the actions were 'I_JUMP' and 'I_WALK', then the command would be 'jump and walk'. This meets the criteria since 'and' is used to conjoin two actions together.  Part  #6: Using 'after' to execute a command following another command. Usage: If the action order was 'I_WALK' then 'I_JUMP', the command may be 'jump after walk'. This is correct because 'after' shows that the jump is to take place following the walk. Part  #7: Implementing the words 'twice' and 'thrice' to trigger the repetition of commands. Usage: For example, if the actions were 'I_WALK', 'I_WALK', and 'I_WALK', the command would be 'walk thrice'. This fits the definition as 'thrice' is used to denote the command 'walk' should be executed three times."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Don’t fall for these dishonest attacks on the ‘metropolitan liberal elite’ Nigel Farage would have burst a blood vessel, had he only had the chance to listen in. What could be more metropolitan liberal elite than last week’s Guardian Christmas telethon, as readers called in to journalists to make a donation for child refugees? Just imagine it, all those Islington luvvies and bleeding hearts, ringing in from one part of London N1 to another, the Bollinger chilling nicely in the fridge, as they salved their well-paid consciences and congratulated themselves on being leftier than thou. How utterly Guardianista. Except it was nothing like that. The calls came from all over the country, with perhaps an over-representation from the north of England. In my two and a half hours on the phones, I heard from Barrow-in-Furness, Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Swansea and a string of small towns and villages from Devon to Cumbria. Colleagues reported the same pattern. True, I took a call from my own small part of north London – but it was the only one. However else you’d want to describe this group of people, metropolitan they weren’t. Nor were they the elite. Pensioners called to give the fiver or tenner they worked out they could spare, or, as Polly Toynbee has recounted, their entire winter fuel allowance. Gary Younge took a call from an unemployed Asian man, living with his parents in northern England, who gave £1.33: he chose that precise sum because he had £1.34 in his account. Meanwhile, and by coincidence, Stuart Heritage spoke again to Sam, the same teenager whose call he took last year. Sam isn’t old enough to have a credit card, but each year he has raised money at his school for the Guardian appeal. Not many of these people fit the Guardianista stereotype. I wonder what Farage and his friends would make of the lifelong reader who described the recent funeral of a 94-year-old friend: a retired major and veteran of the second world war whose devotion to the Guardian was so great that a copy of the paper was placed on top of his coffin. And yet, because of their sympathy for refugees and their presumed support for British membership of the EU – with 91% in favour, Guardian readers were the country’s most solidly pro-remain demographic, more reliably anti-Brexit than Green party voters, the young, university graduates and Scots – these people would be casually, and falsely, dismissed by the likes of Farage as the metropolitan liberal elite. Indeed, in a year brimming with dishonesties, this phrase represents one of the great myths of 2016. In August, serving as warm-up man at a Mississippi rally for Donald Trump, the then Ukip leader hailed the Brexit result as a victory for what he called the “little people, the real people ... the ordinary, decent people”. The implication was that those who had voted remain were unreal and indecent, that they were the big people, the representatives of the mighty and powerful. Theresa May played the same trick in her party conference speech in the autumn, casting the opponents of Brexit (forgetting, of course, that during the referendum campaign she was one) as members of an exclusive, global club, denizens of Davos comfortable in the first-class lounge and utterly devoid of national allegiance – people who were, in her memorable phrase, citizens of the world and therefore citizens of nowhere. As I wrote then, she sought to rebrand the 48% as the 1%. But it’s an absurd lie. Of course, more Britons voted to leave the EU than to stay, but nearly half of those voting chose remain. That is not a tiny metropolitan elite. In the US, 2.9 million more people chose Hillary Clinton than chose Donald Trump. That too is not an elite. In most democratic systems, such a margin would have been hailed as a victory and a mandate; only under the arcane rules of the electoral college could such a result have brought defeat. So enough of this fraudulent talk of elites, metropolitan or otherwise. But what of that middle word, the meat in this rhetorical sandwich? What of “liberal”? After this year, especially, I think the word should be worn with pride. If liberal means wanting to help children fleeing a dictator’s barrel-bombs, then call me a liberal. If liberal means believing that the peoples of a continent that for centuries was torn apart by war and bloodshed have found a new, peaceful mechanism for resolving their differences, and that Britain should play its part in that, then call me a liberal. If liberal means holding true to the values of the Enlightenment, including a belief in facts and evidence and reason, then call me a liberal. And if liberal means cherishing the norms and institutions that protect and sustain democracy, from a free press to an independent judiciary, then call me a liberal. For those values are under assault just now, in a way few of us ever imagined. So when it comes to “liberal”, we have nothing to apologise for. Sure, the remainers’ most public faces could fairly be described as both “metropolitan” and “elite” – columnists for London-based newspapers among them. But the same is self-evidently true of the other side, too. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson are not exactly members of the lumpen proletariat, are they? There is no definition of elite or metropolitan that does not include those two. And the same is true of that other dread phrase of 2016, “the bubble”. As if the only people who live in a bubble are liberal, anti-Trump, anti-Brexit types, while their opponents are rooted in the earthiness of the real world. What garbage. Stockbroker Farage paid homage to billionaire Trump in the latter’s gold elevator; that’s the same Farage who confessed his relief that vacating the Ukip leadership meant he no longer had to deal with “low-grade people” and who said his £85,000 MEP’s salary, excluding abundant expenses, meant he was “poor”. Those who truly live in a bubble are those who cannot begin to imagine the lives of – still less empathise with – those outside their own first-world realm of safety, comfort and prosperity. When Tory MP and Dorset landowner Richard Drax objects to an overseas aid budget of 0.7% of national income, insisting “charity begins at home” – as if 99.3% of our “charity” isn’t already being spent at home – then it’s he who’s living in a bubble. But in this season of goodwill, let’s not play their game – competing over which side is less detached, less metropolitan or less elite. Instead, let’s think of those people who were so moved by the plight of their fellow human beings they gave what they had, even when they could barely spare it. Call them names if you like, but they are the very best of us.

Article: Most schools forbid chewing gum, but in a few years they might consider changing that rule. Why? Scientists are finding evidence that gum chewing may be good for your health. It may even help improve your test scores. This exciting research is just beginning. And in the meantime, companies are also experimenting with adding vitamins, minerals, medicines, and other substances that could give gum the power to cure headaches and fight everything from serious diseases to bad breath. Other researchers are finding that gum might work better than a pill to deliver medicines and other substances into the bloodstream. That's because the lining   of our cheeks can absorb certain substances more quickly than our stomachs and intestines   can. That discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial   gums that cure bad breath. Those projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake. Researchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert. Each stick has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. It can take an hour for the caffeine in coffee to have its full effect, but the caffeine in Stay Alert _ in just a few minutes. The gum is easy to transport and it's stable in cold and hot climates. Unlike a pill, it doesn't require water to swallow. Those qualities make it easy for soldiers to use. For now, Stay Alert is available only to the military  . The manufacturer may one day offer it for sale to the public. People who work at night, such as truck drivers and medical personnel who ride in ambulances, might benefit from a product like Stay Alert. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that   _  . - stay Alert is not easy to store - stay Alert needs water to swallow - stay Alert is available to the public now - we can't buy gums that cure bad breath now","output":"It can be inferred from the passage that we can't buy gums that cure bad breath now."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed \\"the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\\". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \\"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.\\" Question: Many reviewers consider the second part of the book to be about what issue?","output":"Many reviewers consider the second part of the book, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" to be primarily concerned with the issue of race relations. This perspective stems from the deep exploration of the \\"spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\\" as described by book reviewer Harding LeMay. The novel delves into the racial tensions and prejudices faced by African Americans in the South during the 1930s and highlights the moral and social implications of these biases. The novel's focus on race relations is also believed to have been shaped by two significant events involving racial issues in Alabama during the 1950s. The first event was Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott. The second event was the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted as the first African American students. Both events serve as a backdrop to the novel's construction, set amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Overall, the second part of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" tackles the complex issue of race relations in the South, reflecting the conflicts, tensions, and fears experienced by both white and African American individuals during that time. It presents a vivid picture of the stark racial divide, drawing attention to the importance of addressing these prejudices and striving for social and moral change."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  Would car A emit less or more carbon monoxide than car B?  Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. Answer:","output":"Car A would emit less carbon monoxide than car B. The reason for this difference in emissions is due to the presence of a catalytic converter in car A. Catalytic converters are designed specifically to reduce the harmful emissions produced by a vehicle's internal combustion engine. Unburned hydrocarbons in car engines can be more easily converted to carbon dioxide and water when a catalytic converter is present. They enable this conversion by increasing the rate of specific important reactions using catalysts, which are substances that help speed up the chemical processes without being consumed or changed by the reaction themselves. In addition to assisting with the conversion of unburned hydrocarbons, catalytic converters also play a key role in reducing carbon monoxide emissions. Carbon monoxide is a harmful gas produced by the incomplete combustion of fuel. Catalytic converters ensure that carbon monoxide is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, which is less harmful to human health and the environment. Furthermore, catalytic converters help decrease the amount of nitrous oxide compounds emitted from cars. Nitrous oxide compounds are harmful pollutants that contribute to smog and acid rain. In the presence of a catalytic converter, these compounds are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases, reducing the adverse environmental impacts of a car's exhaust. Given this information, it can be concluded that car A, with a catalytic converter, would emit significantly less carbon monoxide compared to car B, which lacks one. This difference makes car A more environmentally friendly and better choice for John if he values lower emissions and a cleaner atmosphere along with the newer features of the car. However, John's preference for the design of car B is also important to consider, and he must weigh the pros and cons of each vehicle before making his final decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  Which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move?  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Tree city experienced less convection within the Earth, causing the plates to move. While both cities are located on plate boundaries and close to volcanoes, Tree city seems to have fewer and less frequent earthquakes compared to Red city. This implies that there are lower stress levels and less energy release happening in Tree city's geological surroundings, which can be linked to less convection in the Earth's mantle that drives plate movement. Since convection is responsible for plate movements, tectonic activity, and resultant earthquakes, we can conclude that Tree city has less convection within the Earth compared to Red city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Start by simplifying the equation on the right-hand side by combining the terms containing 'p'.

Now the main goal is to isolate 'p', to do this we need to eliminate the coefficient of 'p' which is -16. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -16. To remain in balance, what is performed on one side of the equation has to be done on the other side as well. So, we divide both sides of the equation by -16: 224 / -16 = -16*p / -16.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.

A major shake-up of care in the city is taking place as part of a move to the new South Glasgow University Hospital. Doctors at the Beatson cancer centre claim the changes will leave inadequate staffing in the event of emergencies. They have written to Health Secretary Shona Robison to say the situation is \\"desperate\\" and called for action. The doctors claim the reconfiguration of hospital services in the city will see the removal of acute medical support services from the site by the end of next week. The signatories of a letter have called for urgent action amid fears that junior doctors will be left in charge out of hours and that there would be inadequate staffing for resuscitating patients at such times. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it would \\"never put the safety of patients at risk\\". The health secretary said the views of clinicians, including those at the Beatson, \\"need to be fully addressed\\". The letter from senior medical staff, which has also been sent to the General Medical Council, said they \\"cannot continue to admit patients\\" unless changes due to take place next week are stopped. The new super hospital on the south side of Glasgow, which cost Â£842m to build, replaces four ageing hospitals across the city. The consultants have claimed that, three miles away in the Beatson, only junior doctors will be left on site out of hours. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it recognised the consultants' concerns. The health board said temporary arrangements were in place and long-term plans were still being finalised. It said: \\"Plans are also in place to include critical care training for oncology nursing staff. \\"In the interim period we will also provide resident overnight anaesthetic cover to the unit and will identify a named anaesthetic contact for daytime patient management issues.\\" Responding to the letter, Health Secretary Ms Robison said: \\"It is vital that the health board addresses the issues raised so that the move can go ahead with the support of the clinicians. \\"I have spoken to the chairman of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and had assurance this will happen.\\" Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, told BBC Radio's Good morning Scotland programme she had received assurances from the medical director of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde board about patient safety. She said: \\"Always when there are changes there are difficulties on both sides, for the health board and the clinicians. \\"The Beatson provides world-class cancer care to patients from all over the west of Scotland. \\"The service at the moment is extremely safe and the proposals that I have heard about offer very safe care, safe transfer of patients that become more unwell, [and] an enhancement of the seniority of doctors, who will be present 24 hours a day on site.\\" What was that article about?","output":"This article is about some big changes happening at the hospitals in Glasgow, a city in Scotland.

The doctors at a hospital called Beatson, where they help people who have a disease called cancer, are worried they won't have enough staff to take care of the patients if there's an emergency.

Meanwhile, there's a new, really big hospital called the South Glasgow University Hospital that's just been built. Some doctors are worried that once the new hospital is open, only new, less experienced doctors will be left at the old hospital, and they might struggle to help the patients all by themselves.  The people who are in charge of all the hospitals in Glasgow say they understand the worries of these doctors and are making plans to make sure patients will still be safe during this big change.

Answer:","output":"Gracie Mansion has been the official residence of the Mayor of New York City since 1942. It is named after Archibald Gracie, a prosperous Scottish merchant who had the mansion built in 1799. While it has housed many mayors over the years, not all have chosen to live there. The mansion is located in the Mayor's Park in the East End area of Yorkville, Manhattan, overlooking the East River. One famous resident of Gracie Mansion was Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who was the first mayor to live there starting in 1942. Other notable residents included mayors Robert F. Wagner Jr., John Lindsay, and Ed Koch, who all chose to live in the mansion during their terms. Mayor Michael Bloomberg chose not to live in the mansion during his time in office, instead remaining in his own private home. Bloomberg did, however, use Gracie Mansion for official city events. Among those who lived there, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family moved into Gracie Mansion in July 2014. de Blasio was the first mayor to live in the residence since Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who lived there from 1994 until his term ended in 2001. Prior to Giuliani, Mayor David Dinkins also resided in the mansion. Gracie Mansion is not only a home for the mayor; it serves as a functional space used for official city business, including receptions, dinners, and other events. It is also a historic site – a museum of sorts – exhibiting art and furnishings, many from the Federalist period, in the public spaces. The conservancy provides guided tours, sharing the history and significance of the mansion. It is important to note that the residing mayor's presence at Gracie Mansion doesn't interfere with these official activities or public accessibility to historic spaces. The private residential section of the mansion, occupied by the mayor's family, is separate from the public areas of the house, ensuring privacy for the residents and uninterrupted operation of city events and tours. To summarize, the residents of Gracie Mansion are typically the incumbent mayors of New York City and their families. However, this can vary as each mayor has the liberty to choose to reside at the mansion or maintain a private residence elsewhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The Pulitzer Prize for Music is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It was first awarded in 1943. Joseph Pulitzer did not call for such a prize in his will, but had arranged for a music scholarship to be awarded each year. This was eventually converted into a full-fledged prize: \\"For a distinguished musical composition of significant dimension by an American that has had its first performance in the United States during the year.\\" Because of the requirement that the composition had its world premiere during the year of its award, the winning work had rarely been recorded and sometimes had received only one performance. In 2004 the terms were modified to read: \\"For a distinguished musical composition by an American that has had its first performance or recording in the United States during the year.\\"  - The Doctor of Musical Arts degree (D.M.A.) is a doctoral academic degree in music. The D.M.A. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually music performance, music composition, conducting, or music education) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history, music theory, or music pedagogy. The D.M.A. degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the masters and bachelor's degrees), preparing students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers. As a terminal degree, the D.M.A. qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in musicology or music theory typically enter a Ph.D. program, rather than a D.M.A. program. Terminology. The degree is also abbreviated as DMA (without periods), D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D.. For the related degree Doctor of Music, the abbreviation is D.M. or D.Mus. For the related degree Doctor of Arts, the abbreviation D.A. is used.  - St. Olaf College is a coeducational, residential, four-year, private liberal arts college in Northfield, Minnesota, United States.

The college is named after the King and the Patron Saint Olaf II of Norway and is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - The Purple Heart is a United States military decoration awarded in the name of the President to those wounded or killed while serving, on or after April 5, 1917, with the U.S. military.

The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York.  - Carleton College is a private liberal arts college in the historic town of Northfield, Minnesota. The college enrolled 2,014 undergraduate students and employed 245 instructional faculty members in fall 2015. Carleton is one of few liberal arts colleges that runs on the trimester system.  - Archibald MacLeish (May 7, 1892  April 20, 1982) was an American poet and writer who was associated with the Modernist school of poetry. MacLeish studied English at Yale University and law at Harvard University. He enlisted in and saw action during World War One, and lived in Paris in the 1920s. On returning to the US, he contributed to Henry Luce's magazine \\"Fortune\\" from 1929 to 1938. For five years MacLeish was Librarian of Congress, a post he accepted at the urging of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. From 1949 to 1962, MacLeish was Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University. MacLeish was awarded three Pulitzer Prizes for his work.  - The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is a mainline Protestant denomination headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. The ELCA officially came into existence on January 1, 1988, by the merging of three Lutheran church bodies. , it has approximately 3.7 million baptized members in just over 9,300 congregations. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 2.1% of the U.S population self-identifies with the ELCA and mainline Lutheranism. It is the seventh-largest religious body and the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States. The next two largest Lutheran denominations are the Lutheran ChurchMissouri Synod (LCMS) (with approximately 2.1 million members) and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) (with approximately 370,000 members). There are also many in the United States, some of which came into being composed of dissidents following the major 1988 merger. The ELCA belongs to the World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation. The ELCA is in full communion with the Episcopal Church, Moravian Church, Presbyterian Church (USA), Reformed Church in America, United Church of Christ, and the United Methodist Church.  - Bernt Julius Muus (March 15, 1832  May 25, 1900) was a Norwegian-American Lutheran minister and church leader. He helped found St. Olaf College, a private liberal arts college in Northfield, Minnesota.  - The Doctor of Arts (D.A.; occasionally D.Arts or Art.D. from the Latin \\"artium doctor\\") is a discipline-based terminal doctoral degree that was originally conceived and designed to be an alternative to the traditional research-based Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and the education-based Doctor of Education (Ed.D.). Like other doctorates, the D.A. is an academic degree of the highest level. The D.A. is also frequently conferred as an honorary degree with the added designation of honoris causa.  - Leslie Bassett (January 22, 1923  February 4, 2016) was an American composer of classical music, and the University of Michigan's Albert A. Stanley Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Composition. Bassett received the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his \\"Variations for Orchestra\\".  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - The Doctor of Music degree (D.Mus., D.M., Mus.D. or occasionally Mus.Doc.) is a higher doctorate awarded on the basis of a substantial portfolio of compositions and/or scholarly publications on music. Like other higher doctorates, it is granted by universities in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries. Most universities restrict candidature to their own graduates or staff, which is a reversal of the practice in former times, when (unlike higher degrees in other faculties) candidates for the degree were not required to be a Master of Arts.  - Richard Toensing ( March 11 , 1940 - July 2 , 2014 ) was an American composer and music educator .

He's a fun-loving guy who is delighted to learn that Hollywood star Pepita Zorita is at today's game, selling kisses for charity. Wacky promptly borrows money from team publicity man Updyke to buy 300 worth. In the grandstand, catcher Hippo Jones's wife Hazel and the other women are concerned. Wacky is the best pitcher in baseball when he concentrates on what he's doing, but whenever a pretty girl turns his head, a distracted Wacky suddenly can't throw the ball over the plate. The wives want the Sox to be in the World Series so their husbands will receive bonus money. Sure enough, Wacky's infatuation with Pepita begins a run of bad luck for him and the Sox at the ballpark. On the train, the wives protest until Wacky discloses that he and Pepita secretly ran off to get married.

But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains.  \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally.  2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington.

Context: Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\".

Pick the answer from these options Choices:  *fall.  *spring.  *summer.  *winter.","output":"A rabbit's fur would be thickest during the winter season. Rabbits, like many other animals, have developed various physiological adaptations to cope with and survive colder climates. One of these adaptations is having thicker fur during winters, which play a crucial role in providing insulation and keeping the rabbits warm in the cold season. As the temperatures start dropping in the fall, rabbits start to grow their winter coat. This fur is thicker and provides more insulation than their summer coat. The winter coat plays an essential role in helping rabbits maintain a stable body temperature, as it traps a layer of air near the skin which works as an insulating barrier against the cold. It also helps to keep out moisture, protecting rabbits from dampness and decreasing their chances of catching cold associated diseases. By having a thick coat in the winter, rabbits can preserve vital body heat, and prevent excessive heat loss through the skin surface, allowing them to stay active and search for food during the chilly months. This is essential for their survival as they need to have access to enough food to meet their energy requirements and stay healthy. As temperatures rise again in the spring, rabbits start to shed the thick winter coat and transition to a lighter summer coat. Spring and summer are generally warmer seasons, and the need for insulation is reduced; hence, shedding their winter coat allows rabbits to maintain a comfortable body temperature. In summary, the season during which a rabbit's fur would be thickest is winter. This seasonal adaptation helps the rabbits to insulate themselves from low temperatures, keep out moisture, maintain a stable body temperature, and ultimately, increase their chances of survival in harsh conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… According to the above context, answer the following question.

Check you owner’s manual or service guide for proper torque specifications. Replace the bolts that fasten the water pump to the engine block. If you removed heater hoses from your water pump, you will need to slide them back onto the water pump. Once the hose is on the pump you can squeeze down the hose clamp with pliers and slide it up over where the hose and pump connect.  If the clamp has a tightening screw, tighten it with a screwdriver. This will secure the hose to the pump. If the lower radiator hose is still removed or if you removed the upper hose for any reason, put them back on the radiator now. Once the hose has been slid onto the radiator, use a pair of pliers to move the clamps up the hose to the place where the hose and the radiator meet. This will fasten the hose to the radiator. If your coolant looks dirty or if it has been more than a year since you last changed the coolant in your vehicle, use new coolant. Dilute the coolant as specified in your owner’s manual or service guide and fill to the mark that says “cool” or “cold” on the tank.

The Broncos and Chiefs entered the game tied for the AFC West division lead, both with 9-2 records. The Chiefs grabbed the lead late in the first quarter, with quarterback Alex Smith throwing a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Junior Hemingway. The Broncos responded at the beginning of the second quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Decker.

Process: - Chloroplasts in the leaf of the plant traps light from the sun - The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil - This combination of water and minerals flows from the stem into the leaf - Carbon dioxide enters the leaf - Light, water and minerals, and the carbon dioxide all mix together - This mixture forms sugar (glucose) which is what the plant eats - Oxygen goes out of the leaf through the stomata -   Question: suppose I recycle my air before it goes outside happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"Recycling air before it goes outside can influence the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) available for plants, which in turn can impact the process of photosynthesis, and thus affect sugar and oxygen production. In the context of your question, if recycling the air leads to a decrease in the CO2 concentration in the surrounding environment (e.g., if CO2 is being removed or used up in the recycling process), it would result in less sugar and oxygen being produced by the plants. This is because: 1. As CO2 concentration decreases, the rate of photosynthesis is slowed down. Photosynthesis is a light-dependent process triggered by the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll molecules in the chloroplasts. However, it also relies on the availability of CO2, as it is a key reactant along with water (H2O) and sunlight to produce glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). 2. With less CO2 available, there will be fewer reactions of carbon dioxide combining with water to produce glucose, leading to less sugar being generated for the plants to utilize or store. 3. At the same time, the reduction of CO2 also implies fewer oxygen molecules are being produced during the photosynthesis process. This is because oxygen is a byproduct of the light-dependent reaction occurring in the chloroplasts. Thus, recycling the air before it goes outside, if it results in lower CO2 levels, could lead to a decrease in sugar and oxygen production by the plants. However, if your air recycling process maintains or enriches the CO2 levels in the environment, it might not have any negative impact on plant photosynthesis and might even enhance the process. In this case, there would be no effect or a possible positive impact on sugar and oxygen production, given that other factors such as sunlight and water are also available in sufficient amounts to support photosynthesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bernie Sanders dismisses controversy over rapper’s comments at rally as ‘gotcha politics’ Rapper Killer Mike caused controversy at a Bernie Sanders rally in Atlanta Feb. 16, saying \\"a uterus doesn't qualify you to be president of the United States.\\" (Instagram/orangechaglad) ATLANTA — A spokesman for Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Wednesday dismissed as \\"gotcha politics\\" a controversy over comments by rapper Killer Mike, a frequent Sanders surrogate, about whether a uterus alone qualifies someone to be president. Killer Mike, whose real name is Michael Render, was among several African-American supporters who spoke ahead of the Vermont senator at a raucous rally here at the campus of Morehouse College, a historically black institution. During his remarks, Killer Mike relayed a recent conversation with an activist named Jane Elliott, who, he said, told him: \\"A uterus doesn't qualify you to be president of the United States. You have to have policy that's reflective of social justice.\\" [Clinton looks to sisterhood, but votes may go to Sanders] The comment ignited a debate on social media, with some accusing the rapper of being sexist –something he strongly denied through a series of posts on Twitter. Sanders weighed in on Wednesday morning, with a spokesman saying he \\"doesn't believe gender should be a reason to vote for or against someone.\\" \\"That's the point Mike was making when he quoted Jane Elliott, the internationally known educator,\\" said Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs. \\"We need to get beyond the gotcha politics and get to the issues at the heart of the election.\\" [Clinton, feminists and the politics of voting for ‘the old white guy’] In a race featuring Hillary Clinton, who would be the country's first female president, gender has been an undercurrent, with several previous controversies emerging. Killer Mike said on Twitter Tuesday night said that he was only repeating something he had been told and that he was supportive of other women politicians besides Clinton, including Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who also spoke on Sanders's behalf at the rally. \\"I don't and never will Hate or think less of women,\\" Killer Mike said in a tweet. \\"Sen.

Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.  - Ebla ( Arabic :   , modern :   , Tell Mardikh ) , was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria . Its remains constitute a tell located about 55 km ( 34 mi ) southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh . Ebla was an important center throughout the third millennium BC and in the first half of the second millennium BC. Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient , centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia , and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the early Bronze Age . Karl Moore described the first Eblaite kingdom as the first recorded world power . Starting as a small settlement in the early Bronze Age ( c. 3500 BC ) , Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria . Its language , Eblaite , is now considered the earliest attested Semitic language after Akkadian . Ebla was destroyed during the 23rd century BC ; it was then rebuilt and was mentioned in the records of the Third Dynasty of Ur . The second Ebla was a continuation of the first , ruled by a new royal dynasty . It was destroyed at the end of the third millennium BC , which paved the way for the Amorite tribes to settle in the city , forming the third Ebla . The third kingdom also flourished as a trade center ; it became a subject and an ally of Yamhad ( modern - day Aleppo ) until its final destruction by the Hittite king Mursili I in c. 1600 BC. Ebla maintained its prosperity through a vast trading network . Artifacts from Sumer , Cyprus , Egypt and as far as Afghanistan were recovered from the city 's palaces . The political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model . Women enjoyed a special status and the queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs . The pantheon of gods was mainly north Semitic and included deities exclusive to Ebla . The city was excavated starting in 1964 , and became famous for the Ebla tablets , an archive...  - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics.  - Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 12% tin and often with the addition of other metals (such as aluminium, manganese, nickel or zinc) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic, phosphorus or silicon. These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as stiffness, ductility, or machinability.  - The Tigris is the eastern member of the two great rivers that define Mesopotamia, the other being the Euphrates. The river flows south from the mountains of southeastern Turkey through Iraq and empties itself into the Persian Gulf.  - The Euphrates (Sumerian: : \\"Buranuna\\", : \\"Purattu\\", : \\"al-Furt\\", : \\"Prt\\", : \\"Yeprat\\", : \\"Perat\\", ) is the longest and one of the most historically important rivers of Western Asia. Together with the Tigris, it is one of the two defining rivers of Mesopotamia. Originating in eastern Turkey, the Euphrates flows through Syria and Iraq to join the Tigris in the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.  Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki.  - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.  - Idlib (also spelled Edlib or Idleb) is a city in northwestern Syria, capital of the Idlib Governorate, and south west of Aleppo. It has an elevation of nearly above sea level. In the 2004 census by the Central Bureau of Statistics, Idlib had a population of 98,791 (2004 census) and in 2010 the population of Idlib was around 165,000 (2010 census). The inhabitants are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslims, although there is a significant Christian minority. Idlib is divided into six main districts: Ashrafiyeh (the most populous), Hittin, Hejaz, Downtown, Hurriya, and al-Qusur.  - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.  - Idlib Governorate (/ ALA-LC: \\"Mufaat Idlib\\") is one of the fourteen governorates (provinces) of Syria. It is situated in northwestern Syria, bordering Turkey. Reports of its area vary, depending on the source, from 5,933 km² to 6,097 km². The Governorate has a population of 1,464,000 (2010 estimate). The capital is Idlib.  - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism.  - Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".  - East is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from west.  - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.  - The Eastern Mediterranean denotes the countries geographically to the east of the Mediterranean Sea (Levantine Seabasin). This is commonly interpreted in two ways:  - Damascus (' ) is the capital and likely the largest city of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the ongoing battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as \\"ash-Sham\\" (') and nicknamed as the \\"City of Jasmine\\" (\\"\\"). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious centre of the Levant. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 .  - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian  (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders.  - Mardikh is a village in the Idlib Governorate of Syria. It is the nearest village to the site of historical Ebla (\\"Tel Mardikh\\"), south east of Idlib. Nearby localities include Saraqib to the north, Kafr Amim to the east, Maardabsah and Khan al-Sabl to the south and Dadikh to the west. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Mardikh had a population of 2,918 in the 2004 census.  - The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza\\"', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards.  - Beth Nahrain or Bet Nahrain or (\\"house (of the) rivers\\") is the Assyrian name for the region known as Mesopotamia in the Syriac language (Greek \\"land between the rivers\\") as well as its surrounding periphery. Geographically, it refers to the areas around the Euphrates and Tigris rivers (as well as their tributaries). The Aramaic name loosely describes the area of the rivers, not between the rivers, as the literal Greek term does, but both names refer to the same region.  - The Red Sea (also the Erythraean Sea) is a seawater inlet of the Indian Ocean, lying between Africa and Asia. The connection to the ocean is in the south through the Bab el Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. To the north lie the Sinai Peninsula, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez (leading to the Suez Canal). The Red Sea is a Global 200 ecoregion. The sea is underlain by the Red Sea Rift which is part of the Great Rift Valley.

Sir Henry Joseph Wood  (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms.  He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...

Information:  - The Tortricidae are a family of moths, commonly known as tortrix moths or leafroller moths, in the order Lepidoptera. Tortricidae is a large family with over 10,350 species described, and is the sole member of the superfamily Tortricoidea., although the genus \\"Heliocosma\\" is sometimes placed within this superfamily. Many of these are economically important pests. Olethreutidae is a junior synonym. The typical resting posture is with the wings folded back producing a rather rounded profile.  - Olethreutinae is a subfamily of moth in the family Tortricidae.  - In biological classification, especially zoology, the type genus is the genus which defines a biological family and the root of the family name.  - \`\` Lasperesia '' and \`\` Lespeyresia '' redirect here . These are misspellings of Laspeyresia , which was invalidly established for the genus Cydia and actually refers to the noctuid moth genus Laspeyria . Cydia is a large genus of tortrix moths , belonging to the tribe Grapholitini of subfamily Olethreutinae . Its distinctness from and delimitation versus the tribe 's type genus Grapholita requires further study . Moths in this genus are generally small and dull brown ; their caterpillars are yellow or white and wormlike . Cydia includes many species of economic importance due to the damage their caterpillars inflict as pests of agricultural crops , especially fruit and nut trees . On the other hand , some Cydia species have been used for biological control of invasive weeds , and many of these small moths and their caterpillars are an important food source for other animals . A few species from the Hawaiian Islands are suspected to be extinct due to disappearance of their foodplants . Another well - known species is the Jumping Bean Moth ( C. deshaisiana ) , whose caterpillars live in Sebastiania seeds , turning them into the famous \`\` Mexican jumping beans '' .  - Zoology (UK: , zoo-OL-luh-jee; US: , zoh-OL-luh-jee) or animal biology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek , \\"zion\\", i.e. \\"animal\\" and , \\"logos\\", i.e. \\"knowledge, study\\".  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.

NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston. We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina,\\" he said. Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston \\"had honored their obligation, this would not be an issue.\\"  Question: \\"How many years after buying buildings in Charleston and Georgetown did the NLAP buy again?\\" Response: \\"5 years\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. Let me explain it in a simpler way. The passage talks about when NLAP bought buildings in Charleston and Georgetown using LSC grant money. Here's when they bought the buildings: - Charleston: 1978 (with 50,000) - Georgetown: 1978 (with 33,000) - Conway: 1980 (with 63,000) So, the NLAP bought the Conway building 2 years after buying the buildings in Charleston and Georgetown."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Process:  - You breathe in - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose lungs that breathe in air efficiently happens, how will it affect shortness of breath.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've mentioned supposes that lungs breathe in air more efficiently, and we need to consider how this would affect shortness of breath and whether it impacts the breathing process directly or indirectly. When lungs breathe in air efficiently, it means that more oxygen is getting into the lungs and thus into the bloodstream quickly. The process remains the same, but the speed and efficiency of the process are increased: 1. You breathe in, and air enters your lungs faster and more effectively. 2. Air flows through the bronchial branches in your lungs, reaching the alveoli more efficiently. 3. Oxygen diffuses through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries more rapidly, allowing more oxygen to enter the bloodstream. 4. Red blood cells receive more oxygen from the alveoli, allowing them to deliver more oxygen to tissues and organs. 5. Carbon dioxide is picked up by the red blood cells, replacing the oxygen. 6. You breathe out, expelling carbon dioxide from your lungs. In the context of this perturbation hypothesis, shortness of breath (dyspnea) would likely be reduced or less frequent. Shortness of breath occurs when the body cannot get enough oxygen or get rid of enough carbon dioxide, potentially due to lung or heart issues. If the lungs are breathing in air more efficiently, the body would be better equipped to handle its oxygen needs and carbon dioxide removal. This more efficient process would alleviate some of the causes related to shortness of breath. The supposed perturbation affects the process more directly, as it results in an overall improvement in both the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveoli as well as the speed at which this exchange occurs. However, it is essential to note that efficient lung function is just one factor contributing to shortness of breath. Other factors, such as heart conditions, poor physical fitness, or other underlying health issues, may still contribute to breathing difficulties regardless of the efficiency of the lungs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, let's examine the information given in both statements: 1. Statement 1: \\"A puppy is trying to catch a rabbit.\\"    - The animal in question is a puppy.    - The puppy is engaged in an act of chasing a rabbit.    - There is no indication of the puppy's physical appearance or its environment. 2. Statement 2: \\"A white dog with red ears is running in the snow.\\"    - The animal in question is a dog.    - The dog has specific physical characteristics: it is white with red ears.    - The dog is running (a type of movement that can align with chasing behavior).    - The environment is characterized by the presence of snow. Based on these points, we can try to relate the two statements: - The animal: A puppy is a young dog, so it is possible that the subject of the first statement (the puppy) could be the same as the subject in the second one (the dog). However, this assumption cannot be made with certainty based on the information provided. - The behavior: In both statements, the animal is described as engaging in some sort of movement (attempting to catch a rabbit and running). It could be inferred that running is an appropriate action when trying to catch a rabbit. However, this connection is still insufficient evidence to directly conclude that the two statements describe the same situation. - The physical appearance: There is no information available in the first statement to establish a connection with the specific physical characteristics described in the second statement, i.e., a white dog with red ears. - The environment: The first statement doesn't provide any details about the environment in which the puppy is trying to catch the rabbit. Thus, we cannot assume that the event takes place in a snowy environment, as described in the second statement. In conclusion, while some aspects of the two statements might have some connections (the animal and the behavior), there is not enough information presented to directly conclude that \\"A white dog with red ears is running in the snow\\" when given the statement, \\"A puppy is trying to catch a rabbit.\\" These statements could potentially describe the same event, but they could also be about completely different situations.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name whose older sister hears nothing but praise from their mother? from the following article ?  Connie Wyatt is a restless 15-year-old who is anxious to explore the pleasures of her sexual awakening. Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family farm house. She suffers from her mother's put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising the local shopping mall with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from the boy's car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, \\"I'm watching you!\\" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the house, while her family goes to a barbecue. Later, as Connie is playing around the house, a man who calls himself Arnold Friend approaches her in a 1960s convertible with that name painted on it and identifies himself as \\"A. Friend\\". He dresses and acts like James Dean, and name-drops several teenybopper acts, even though he is much older than she is. He comes off very kind and friendly, but a bit suspicious, alternating between talking to her in a warm, seductive voice and shouting insults to his fellow car passenger when he asks Arnold if he should \\"pull out the phone,\\" possibly to keep her from calling the police. Arnold tells Connie about how he has been watching her and that he knows all about her, recounting the details about her family's barbecue plans with amazing accuracy. He then starts talking about how he could be her lover.

But that has long been gone.  Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century.  Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which century saw northeast Michigan's water table at decreased level, sixteenth century or twentieth century? Answer:","output":"The twentieth century saw northeast Michigan's water table at a decreased level.  Step 1: Identify changes in vegetation and land usage throughout the centuries. In the sixteenth century, Michigan had forests all over, including elm and oak trees. In contrast, the twentieth century saw the northeastern part of the state cleared of vegetation and wooded areas replaced by farmlands. Step 2: Understand the impact of irrigation on the water table. The paragraph mentions that in the twentieth century, all these farmlands were under heavy irrigation. This increased need for water to sustain these farmlands would have required the extraction of water from the ground, resulting in a decreased water table. Step 3: Combine information from steps 1 and 2 to arrive at a conclusion. Comparing the information from the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, it is clear that the water table would likely have decreased during the twentieth century due to the clearance of vegetation for agricultural purposes and the subsequent increased demand for water for irrigation purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticized coach Frank Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Pavement was formed in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had previously performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, \\"It was pretty reasonable to be able to make a single for 1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band.\\" Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed 800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.Slay Tracks was recorded during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing the studio and the recording process, said, \\"You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a guide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top.\\" Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, \\"[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'\\" Kannberg said, \\"We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it.\\" The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.

They need to find the reasons for this phenomenon.  Which group would not only have reduced melanin, group A or group B?  Hint: Leucism (/ˈluːsɪzəm, -kɪz-/)[1][2][3] is a condition in which there is partial loss of pigmentation in an animal resulting in white, pale, or patchy coloration of the skin, hair, feathers, scales or cuticle, but not the eyes.[3] It is occasionally spelled leukism. Unlike albinism, it is caused by a reduction in multiple types of pigment, not just melanin. A:","output":"Based on the provided hint, both leucism and albinism are conditions resulting from a loss or reduction of pigmentation. However, there are differences between the two. Leucism (Group A) is a partial loss of pigmentation, which results in white, pale, or patchy coloration of the skin, hair, feathers, scales, or cuticle, but not the eyes. This condition is caused by a reduction in multiple types of pigment, which includes melanin but may also involve other pigments. Albinism (Group B), on the other hand, is a congenital absence of pigmentation specifically due to a near-total or total lack of melanin production. This results in a complete absence of color in the skin, hair, and eyes. Albino animals typically have very light-colored or completely white skin, hair, or feathers, and their eyes may appear pink or red due to a lack of pigmentation. To answer your question, Group B (the albino group) would have a more significant reduction in melanin as compared to Group A (the leucistic group). This is because albinism is characterized by a near-total or total absence of melanin production, whereas leucism is a partial loss of pigmentation involving a reduction in multiple types of pigment, not just melanin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: What are the two shortest field goals made?","output":"Title: The Tale of the Shortest Field Goals in Football History Introduction Field goals are among the most crucial aspects of American football, as they have the power to decide the outcome of a game with their consistent point-scoring abilities. Unlike the unpredictability of touchdowns, field goals have become increasingly reliable over the years, and their significance has grown tremendously. Though field goal distances can vary wildly, with some reaching over 60 yards, it's a rarity for extremely short field goals to be attempted, let alone executed. In this article, we delve into the rather unusual tale of the two shortest field goals ever made in football history. The Shortest Field Goals: A Rare Occurrence A typical field goal happens when the offensive team opts to kick the ball through the goalposts during its fourth down instead of attempting to continue its drive. Most professional teams have a field goal kicker, specifically trained and skilled in this department to successfully score points from a variety of distances. However, when we talk about unusually short field goals, we are discussing attempts made from a distance of fewer than 10 yards – a highly unusual event in football. 1. Detroit Lions vs. New Orleans Saints, 1970 – 8-Yard Field Goal The first of our two shortest field goal attempts took place on November 8, 1970, during a game between the Detroit Lions and the New Orleans Saints. The Lions' hall of fame kicker, Errol Mann, is credited with successfully executing an 8-yard field goal, considered one of the shortest distances in NFL history. The game took place in Tulane Stadium, New Orleans, and was part of the season's Week 7. This particular field goal was set up due to a fumble by the Saints' quarterback Billy Kilmer, which occurred at the New Orleans 1-yard line. On the following play, the Lions tried to rush for a touchdown but were stopped at the 1-yard line by the Saints' defense. In a striking move, the Lions chose to kick a field goal from the 8-yard line rather than trying to force a touchdown. Mann made good on this rare opportunity, securing his place in history with a successful 8-yard field goal attempt. 2. New England Patriots vs. Buffalo Bills, 1976 – 9-Yard Field Goal The second-shortest field goal attempt in NFL history took place on September 19, 1976. John Smith of the New England Patriots managed to successfully kick a 9-yard field goal, setting a then-record that would only be outdone by Mann's feat several years later. The Patriots faced off against their division rivals, the Buffalo Bills, who were led by Hall of Fame coach Chuck Knox. Despite the length of the field goal, Smith's attempt proved to be a crucial moment in a tightly contested game that was eventually won by the Patriots with a score of 26-22. The Factors Behind Short Field Goals  Short field goals are highly infrequent in football due to the inherent risks and low rewards associated with such an attempt. An offensive team is more likely to attempt a touchdown from close range, especially when the distance to the goal line is under 10 yards. If a team cannot convert a touchdown from that distance, it is often wiser to \\"go for it\\" on the fourth down instead of opting for a field goal. Another notable factor is the change in field goal post positioning over the years. In 1974, the NFL moved the goalposts from the goal line to the end line, making short field goals virtually impossible in today's game. This move added an additional 10 yards to field goal distances, eliminating the potential for any future attempts under 10 yards in the NFL. Conclusion The shortest field goals in football history, made by Errol Mann and John Smith, represent a fascinating chapter in the sport's competitive evolution. The 8 and 9-yard attempts showcase the interplay of strategy, unpredictability, and skill in professional football and serve as a reminder of how the game has evolved over the years. While we may never see such unusually short field goals again, they undoubtedly remain etched in the memories of football enthusiasts as exceptional moments in the annals of NFL history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I bought this cam about two weeks ago and I have been quite happy with it. I was previously using the Logitech QuickCam Orbit which does indeed have better picture quality and motion possibilities. But that cam was just too clunky for my current purposes (using a laptop with limited table space). I haven't noticed that the picture is dark and grainy as a lot of reviewers have noted. However, on my cam and computer, the picture does seem to be somewhat washed out and faded. I can deal with this factor as the compact size is perfect for my purposes and, when clipped to the top of my monitor, it allows me to look directly into the camera allowing people to have a direct \\"eye-to-eye\\" view of me. Yes, there are better webcams available. But, for the price, I find this to be a great little cam! Is this product review negative? The answer is:","output":"No, this product review is not entirely negative. While the reviewer acknowledges some drawbacks to the webcam, such as washed-out colors and a somewhat inferior picture quality compared to the Logitech QuickCam Orbit, they ultimately express satisfaction with their purchase. They appreciate the compact size of the camera, which suits their needs better, and the ability to provide a direct \\"eye-to-eye\\" view during conversations.

Diego Simeone was on the verge of making history with Atletico Madrid before he and his side imploded to bitter local rivals Real in the Champions League final. Simeone ran on to the pitch twice, either side of extra time, to confront referee Bjorn Kuipers and Raphael Varane as Atletico lost 4-1 at Benfica's Stadium of Light. The La Liga champions looked like they were on course to win a maiden European crown when defender Diego Godin headed them in front before half-time. Frustrated figure: Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone was furious with referee Bjorn Kuipers Livid: Simeone was furious with Kuipers (centre) for allowing five minutes of second-half injury time The incident came amidst","output":"increasing tensions as Real Madrid sought an equalizer in the dying moments of the match. Atletico Madrid players and coaching staff were visibly frustrated with the referee's decision to allow five minutes of second-half injury time, which they considered excessive. Their frustration was understandable, as Los Rojiblancos had successfully maintained their one-goal lead throughout the majority of the match and were just minutes away from securing their first-ever Champions League title. As the clock ticked away during the injury time, Real Madrid's persistence finally paid off when Sergio Ramos headed home a corner kick in the last minute of stoppage time, dramatically leveling the score and forcing the match into extra time. This last-gasp goal sent shockwaves through the Atletico Madrid camp, as they were left shell-shocked and deflated, with their dream of lifting the Champions League trophy slipping through their fingers. In the extra-time, Atletico Madrid's exhaustion and disappointment began to show on the pitch. Real Madrid, invigorated by their late equalizer, took full advantage of their rival's physical and mental state. Los Blancos scored three more goals through Gareth Bale, Marcelo, and Cristiano Ronaldo, completing their comeback from a one-goal deficit to beat Atletico Madrid, 4-1. Simeone's frustrations compounded throughout the game, culminating in his confrontations with the referee and Varane. He believed the officials had dealt Atletico numerous injustices, including the controversial allowance of extended injury time. This, in his mind, had significantly contributed to their collapse in the final stages of the match. The defeat was a devastating blow to Atletico, who had previously won La Liga for the first time in 18 years, just a week before the Champions League final. After defying the odds and toppling La Liga giants, Barcelona and Real Madrid, in the domestic league, their European dream was brought to a grinding halt. Despite the heart-wrenching loss, Diego Simeone and his Atletico Madrid side would go on to be a formidable force in European football in the coming seasons. They have consistently finished among the top teams in the Champions League, and although they have not yet claimed the prestigious trophy, their resilience and determination to compete at the highest level are a testament to Simeone's impact on the club. In conclusion, the pivotal moment in the 2014 Champions League final, where Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid looked set to etch their names into history, ended in an agonizing flourish of goals from their local rivals. Despite every challenge thrown their way, Atletico's journey to the final demonstrated their tenacity and ability to defy expectations. While the disappointment of that night still lingers, it serves as motivation for Simeone and his players to continue striving for glory in the years to come."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a dialog between 2 or more individuals.

Ping: In the context of blogging, a ping is an XML-RPC signal sent from a blog to a server, such as a blog search engine or an update service, to notify them of new content added or updates made to the blog. This enables real-time indexing, faster discoverability, and improves the overall visibility of the content. 2. Spam blog (splog): A spam blog or a splog is a blog that is created solely for search engine manipulation, advertising, or to generate affiliate or pay-per-click revenue. It contains low-quality content, often stolen or scraped from other legitimate sources, with minimal to no originality or usefulness. Splogs are detrimental to the blogging ecosystem, as they clutter the search results, waste resources, and affect the user experience. 3. Sping: A sping, sometimes also referred to as spam ping, is a ping sent from a spam blog. It is specifically designed to deceive search engines, update services, and aggregators into believing that the splog has updated or created new content. Spings are used to gain an unfair advantage over genuine blogs in terms of search engine rankings, visibility, and traffic. They also contribute to the spam and noise prevalent in the blogging environment. The remaining choices do not correctly define a ping sent from a spam blog: - Ham: In the context of spam filtering, ham refers to legitimate email or content that is not considered spam. It does not relate to pings or spam blogs. - Splurp: Splurp does not have a recognized meaning or definition in the context of spam blogs or pings. - Splog: As mentioned earlier, \\"splog\\" refers to a spam blog, not the ping sent from one. - Blam: Blam does not relate to spam blogs or pings and has no recognized meaning or definition in this context. Based on the understanding and elimination of the other choices, \\"sping\\" is the correct answer, as it accurately reflects the concept of a ping sent from a spam blog."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: BENGHAZI, LIBYA - Gunfire erupted in at least three neighborhoods of the Libyan capital of Tripoli Friday, as opponents of Moammar Gaddafi tried to revive their protests against his regime in spite of a massive security clampdown.      Hours earlier, Libyan state television announced that the government would distribute 400 to each family in a bid to head off fresh demonstrations called for by regime opponents after Friday's midday prayers.      It was the first time the regime--which also pledged pay hikes for state employees of up to 150 percent-- has attempted to offer incentives to Libyans to remain loyal.      Gunfire was reported shortly after prayers finished, suggesting that some protesters were attempting to take to the streets, said a caller from Tripoli who requested anonymity because he feared for his life.      But it was unclear whether Tripoli's residents would be able to counter the massive presence of police, army soldiers and paramilitaries who descended on the city Thursday evening to protect one of Gaddafi's last remaining strongholds.      \\"Everybody's suspicious, worried, afraid, because we have families,\\" said the caller, a trader who said he did not dare go out to protest. Gunshots could be heard over the telephone line. \\"We are 10 percent afraid for ourselves and 90 percent afraid for our families. They won't just shoot us, maybe they will get revenge on the whole household, the whole family, even the whole street.      \\"These people have no mercy,\\" the caller added. \\"We have known them for 42 years.\\"      \\"Fear, fear, fear,\\" was how another businessman described the mood in the city Thursday evening. But he nonetheless predicted a big turnout for Friday's demonstrations. \\"It's now or never,\\" he said of the effort to intensify the rebellion in Gaddafi's stronghold, where forces loyal to the Libyan leader forcefully suppressed an earlier wave of protests.      Across the Middle East and North Africa, demonstrators again gathered on the Muslim holy day to call for democracy and government reforms. In Iraq, tens of thousands of Iraqis defied curfews to take the the streets for what was billed as \\"A Day of Rage.\\" Several deaths were reported.      In Cairo, thousands of Egyptians gathered in Tahrir Square to commemorate the beginning of their revolution exactly one month ago, and to remind the military council ruling the country that many demands remain unmet.      A strong undercurrent of support for neighboring Libya was palpable, with chants and banners proclaiming \\"Egypt and Libya, we are one.\\"      The Egyptian demonstrators called on the Supreme Military Council to replace the prime minister and his cabinet, lift a long-standing and repressive emergency law and put the interior ministry police under civilian control. \\"We don't want this government,\\" said Mariam Abdel Rehim, 27, who is working on a master's degree in physical education. \\"It was formed by the former president.\\" ||||| Patrick Baz, AFP / Getty Images      Libya's embattled Col. Moammar Gadhafi compared himself to Queen Elizabeth today while blaming the violent uprising in his country on Osama bin Laden and what he said were drugged-up and armed Libyan teenagers.\\"Bin Laden ... this is the enemy who is manipulating people,\\" Gadhafi said. \\"Do not be swayed by bin Laden.\\"Gadhafi was expected to appear on state television today but instead spoke via telephone for 20 minutes in an often bizarre, disjointed monologue while the in-studio anchor was forced to stare at the camera without interrupting.The dictator's speech came after reports that his cousin, Ahmed Gadhaf al-Dam, a high-ranking member of his inner circle, had fled to Egypt and that Gadhafi was rapidly losing support from other loyalists.\\"He's scared,\\" one protester told Al-Jazeera television after Gadhafi's speech. \\"He was supposed to show himself on TV today but instead he's in hiding because he knows he's on the way out.\\"Gadhafi often sounded like a crazily out-of-touch father figure as he warned Libyans to control their children and get them off the streets.Despite evidence that many of the protesters are in their 20s and older, Gadhafi said the uprising was being fomented by teen-agers who had been given pills by enemies of the regime.\\"Get ahold of your children and get them at home,\\" Gadhafi said. \\"Those teen-agers are trigger-happy and they shoot at anything, especially when they're stoned on drugs. There's nobody over 20 out there.\\"Gadhafi also portrayed himself as a symbolic figure, like the \\"queen of England,\\" and said he had only \\"moral authority\\" over the nation. He said he could not enact laws and that the true power was in the hands of the people.He made no concessions other than to say that state salaries might be \\"reconsidered.\\"However, just hours before he spoke, there were unconfirmed reports out of Az Zawiyah, 30 miles outside Tripoli, that more than 100 people had been fired on by soldiers loyal to Gadhafi this morning and an unknown number killed.Though at least 1,000 people reportedly have been killed in Libya since the uprising began, Gadhafi gave his condolences to the families of just four people, members of his state security forces who were killed.\\"It's all because of bin Laden,\\" Gadhafi said. \\"Al-Qaida is manipulating our country. They don't care about you, they just want to kill your kids so you can have control.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"Protests against Moammar Gaddafi's regime intensified in Tripoli, Libya, despite a heightened security presence.

The reviewer provides various positive aspects they enjoyed about the CD and sheds light on the reasons behind their purchase. They recognized Bunny's name as a talented back-up singer for numerous other artists, which led them to trust the material within the CD. Their appreciation for the store where they found the CD establishes a nostalgic connection that enhances the listener's experience. The reviewer's favorite track, \\"Talking With The Angels,\\" is mentioned, indicating that they were familiar with the songs and enjoyed them. Furthermore, they stated that the album is \\"thoroughly enjoyable\\" and contrary to the jazz label, it is described as straight up pop. This could be considered a compliment, as it sets the CD apart from typical jazz, potentially making it more appealing to a wider audience. Additionally, the mention of the \\"flawless\\" production for pop music further underlines the quality of the CD. Despite the flattering aspects, there is a small unflattering note in the review. The reviewer mentioned how they wished Bunny's solo catalog was more accessible. While this could imply the album was genuinely enjoyable to the point that the reviewer sought more material from the artist, it also infers that the CD is somewhat rare and potentially difficult to acquire. In conclusion, the review generally portrays the CD in a positive and flattering light with only a minor hint of negativity regarding the accessibility of Bunny's solo catalog.

Bereits heute können Landwirte Verträge mit der Industrie, mit der Milchindustrie, über bestimmte Mengen zu Festpreisen abschließen. Translate to English","output":"Already today, farmers can enter into contracts with industry, specifically with the milk industry, for fixed quantities at fixed prices. In today's global economy, farmers have the opportunity to establish contracts with various industries, such as the milk industry, to secure a stable income and ensure a constant supply of their products. These contracts, known as forward contracts or futures contracts, allow farmers to agree on a specific quantity of their goods to be delivered to the industry at a predetermined price over a given time frame. Entering into these contracts not only benefits the farmers but also the industries and consumers. Fixed prices in the contracts provide financial stability to farmers and help them make long-term plans for their business. Furthermore, they can secure funding for investments in their farms, knowing that they have a guaranteed income. For the industries, having a stable supply of raw materials ensures that they can maintain their production levels and plan their business strategies accordingly. It reduces the risk of disruption due to shortages of raw materials or unpredictable market fluctuations. Additionally, long-term contracts can lead to cost savings, as industries can better plan their production processes, minimize waste, and optimize their logistics. Consumers benefit from these contracts as well since they contribute to the stabilization of prices for the final products. A continuous supply of raw materials to industries and transparent pricing mechanisms helps prevent sudden price hikes or shortages of goods in the market, ensuring that consumers have access to what they need. Moreover, these types of contracts have an impact on sustainability in agriculture. By guaranteeing a specific revenue regardless of the market conditions, farmers can focus on adopting more sustainable farming practices, enhancing crop cycle management, and preserving their land's long-term viability. In conclusion, fixed quantity and fixed price contracts between farmers and industries, such as the milk industry, provide stability and predictability for farmers, industries, and consumers alike.

Q:I read this background article the other day: In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication).  Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8]  I am facing a new situation today: Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which path will be marched over less frequently? A:","output":"Based on the information given in the background article, the ants follow and reinforce pheromone trails that lead to food sources. The article also elaborates that the more time an ant takes to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. Given Ricky's situation, where path A is approximately 100 meters and path B is approximately 150 meters, it's reasonable to conclude that ants will take longer to travel through path B and back than path A due to its longer length. Consequently, the pheromone trail on path B is likely to evaporate more than that on path A, reducing its attractive strength. From the knowledge acquired, it can therefore be concluded that path B will be marched over less frequently by the ants compared to path A. This is due to the process of pheromone evaporation, making path A with its stronger and more consistent pheromone density a more preferred route by the ants. My step-by-step reasoning includes the understanding the behavior of ants, the correlation between the path length, pheromone evaporation, and the frequency of the marching over paths, and finally the application of these principles to the specifics of Ricky's situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Namdev, also transliterated as Namdeo and Namadeva, (traditionally, c. 1270 - c. 1350) was a poet-saint from Maharashtra, India who is significant to the Varkari sect of Hinduism. He is also venerated in Sikhism, as well as Hindu warrior-ascetic traditions such as the Dadupanthis and the Niranjani Sampraday that emerged in north India during the Islamic rule. The details of Namdev's life are unclear. He is the subject of many miracle-filled hagiographies composed centuries after he died. Context: The literary works of Namdev were influenced by Vaishnava philosophy and a belief in Vithoba. Along with the Jnanesvari, a sacred work of Jnanesvar, and of Bhakti movement teacher-writers such as Tukaram, the writings of Namdev form the basis of the beliefs held by the Varkari sect of Hinduism. He was thus among those responsible for disseminating the monotheistic Varkari faith that had emerged first in Karnataka in the mid-to-late 12th century and then spread to Pandharpur in Maharashtra.  Namdev and Jnanesvar used the Marathi language to convey their beliefs rather than using the traditional Sanskrit language that was essentially a buttress for the pre-eminence of the Brahmin priests. Namdev's style was to compose simply worded praise for Vithoba and to use a melodic device called samkirtana, both of which were accessible to common people. Shima Iwao says that \\"He taught that all can be saved equally, without regard to caste, through devotion (bhakti) to Vithoba\\" and that he greatly influenced groups of people who were forbidden by the Brahmin elite from studying the Vedas, such as women and members of the Shudra and untouchable communities.  The earliest anthological record of Namdev's works occurs in the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh scriptures compiled in 1604, although Novetzke notes that while the manuscript records of Namdev mostly date from the 17th and 18th centuries, there exists a manuscript from 1581 that presents a rarely recounted variant version of Namdev's Tirthavli, a Marathi-language autobiographical piece. It is evident that the Guru Granth record is an accurate rendition of what Namdev wrote: the oral tradition probably accounts significantly for the changes and additions that appear to have been made by that time. The numerous subsequently produced manuscripts also show variant texts and additions that are attributed to him. Of around 2500 abhangs that were credited to him and written in the Marathi language, perhaps only 600 - 700 are authentic. The surviving manuscripts are geographically dispersed and of uncertain provenance. Question: Did anything else come out of Namdev's teachings? Answer:","output":"Yes, apart from the significant impact on the Varkari sect of Hinduism and the influence on the Sikh faith, Namdev's teachings had several other outcomes: 1. Promotion of the Marathi language: Namdev, along with other Bhakti movement poets such as Jnanesvar and Tukaram, helped popularize the Marathi language as a medium for conveying spiritual and philosophical ideas. This went against the prevailing trend of using Sanskrit, a language mostly accessible to the Brahmin priests. In doing so, he made spiritual teachings accessible to a wider audience. 2. Championing social equality: Namdev's teachings emphasized that all individuals, regardless of their caste, gender, or social standing, could achieve spiritual salvation through devotion (bhakti) to Vithoba. This approach contradicted the Brahminical ideology prevalent at the time and played a crucial role in breaking down social barriers and promoting spiritual equality. 3. Encouraging the use of music and arts: Namdev's style incorporated simple, melodious compositions called samkirtana, which were easily accessible and enjoyed by common people. This approach fostered an appreciation for music and the arts as means to express devotion and connect with the divine. 4. Inspiring subsequent generations of poets and saints: Namdev's teachings formed the basis for the beliefs of the Varkari sect of Hinduism, and his works greatly influenced future poets, saints, and spiritual practitioners. His emphasis on devotion, social equality, and the use of local languages inspired many followers to continue exploring similar themes in their own works. In conclusion, Namdev's teachings had far-reaching effects not only on Varkari sect of Hinduism and Sikhism, but also on language, social equality, arts, and future generations of poets and spiritual leaders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was imprisoned in Stirling in 1694? from the following article ?  Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists.

Given the question: Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. Tim has a device which lets him see what the average kinetic energy is of the particles in each pot is. After examining each pot, Tim discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, and pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy.  Which pot is closer to boiling?  Hint: The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” The answer is:","output":"To answer the question, we need to determine which pot is closer to boiling based on the information provided about the average kinetic energy of the particles in each pot. Step 1: Analyze the given information Pot A: Particles with very high average kinetic energy Pot B: Particles with low average kinetic energy Step 2: Relate average kinetic energy to temperature We know that the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance is directly proportional to its temperature. So, if the average kinetic energy is higher, the temperature is also higher, and vice versa. Step 3: Compare the temperature of pot A and pot B Based on the given information, the particles in pot A have a higher average kinetic energy than those in pot B, which means that pot A has a higher temperature. Step 4: Determine which pot is closer to boiling Since boiling occurs at a specific temperature for a given substance (e.g., 100°C for water at sea level), the pot with the higher temperature will be closer to boiling. Conclusion: Pot A is closer to boiling, because its particles have a higher average kinetic energy, which corresponds to a higher temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Zhou Yu, born in a humble military family, grows up witnessing the suffering of his people under the tyranny of the Eastern Han Empire. Gifted with exceptional martial skills, intellect, and a strong commitment to restoring peace in the land, Zhou Yu sets his sights on overthrowing the oppressive rulers and unifying the fragmented kingdoms. As the story unfolds, Zhou Yu befriends the brilliant military strategist, Zhuge Liang, played by John Cho, who shares the same vision of a unified China and a prosperous future for their people. Together, they form a strong alliance and combine their military prowess to challenge the ruling Eastern Han Dynasty and other threatening warlords vying for power. In the midst of their quest to bring change to their homeland, both Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang find themselves in a tangled web of alliances, betrayals, and political machinations. They encounter a diverse array of historical characters, including the cunning Cao Cao, the ambitious Sun Quan, and the enigmatic Zhu Geliang, all brilliantly played by an ensemble of renowned Asian actors. In one of the story's pivotal moments, Zhou Yu and his forces successfully defend the kingdom of Wu, led by Sun Quan, from a massive invasion orchestrated by Cao Cao. Through their mutual respect and unwavering determination, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang form an ever-stronger bond, symbolized by the iconic Red Phoenix (representing Zhou Yu) and the White Dragon (representing Zhuge Liang). As Zhou Yu's fame and influence grow, so does the desire of others, friends and foes alike, to see him fall. Zhou Yu faces several attempts on his life and a series of heartbreaking betrayals, testing the depths of his loyalty to his cause and the strength of his friendship with Zhuge Liang. Amidst these challenges, Zhou Yu finds solace in the love of his wife, Xiao Qiao, played by Gemma Chan, who supports and encourages him to overcome adversity and follow his destiny. As the movie reaches its climax, the \\"Battle of the Red Phoenix\\" takes center stage. The symbolic Red Phoenix, representing the indomitable spirit of Zhou Yu, clashes against powerful enemies in the final battle for their homeland's future. Friends' loyalties are tested, sacrifices are made, and legends are born in this epic confrontation. However, plots and intrigues within their own ranks leave Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang with a bittersweet victory.

Q:Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations.  Which path will be marched over less frequently? A:","output":"In order to determine which path will be marched over less frequently, we need to consider a few factors such as the distance of the paths, the amount of food sources, and potential hazards along the routes. Let's analyze the problem step-by-step. Step 1: Assess the given information Ricky, the entomologist, found two distinct paths (A and B) used by ants to find food. Path A is 100 meters long and path B is 150 meters long. Step 2: Consider the distance of the paths Since path A is shorter in length than path B, we can infer that ants traveling on path A will spend less time and energy to reach their destinations compared to those traveling on path B. Step 3: Assess the food sources and potential hazards We don't have information about the food sources and potential hazards along each route. For simplicity, let's assume that those factors are equal for both paths. Step 4: Make a conclusion Assuming equal food sources and potential hazards, ants would choose the most efficient route which conserves energy and time. Thus, path A, being the shorter route, would likely be marched over more frequently than path B. Conclusion: Based on these factors, path B will be marched over less frequently due to its longer distance compared to path A."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write a summary based on this article: The Summer Olympics will head to Los Angeles in 2028.      The city said it has struck a deal with the International Olympic Committee to host the games. The announcement clears the way for Paris to hold the Olympics in 2024.      The L.A. City Council will hold an ad-hoc meeting on Friday to discuss accepting the deal, said spokeswoman Caolinn Mejza.      The IOC said it will give the Los Angeles organizing committee 1.8 billion as part of the agreement. The incentive package aims in part to \\"increase participation and access to youth sports programmes in the City of Los Angeles in the years leading up to the Games,\\" according to an IOC statement.      Related: Paris and Los Angeles set to get 2024 and 2028 Olympics      Earlier this month, the IOC broke with tradition by deciding to award two games at once. It said the 2024 and 2028 games would go to Paris and Los Angeles -- it just hadn't decided which city would get which year.      The decision will be finalized in September.      Paris and Los Angeles were the only competitors left for 2024 after rival cities pulled their bids because of worries over cost.      Hosting a modern Olympics practically guarantees massive debt and cost overruns. Researchers at Oxford's Saïd Business School estimate the cost overrun for the 2016 Summer Olympics, in Rio de Janeiro, was 1.6 billion.      Officials from Paris and Los Angeles had stressed that their cities already have more than 90% of the facilities they need to host, reducing the additional cost.      In a statement, the team organizing Paris' 2024 bid said it \\"welcomes\\" the news.      \\"We are now looking forward to the opportunity of working with Los Angeles, and contributing to successful Games both in 2024 and 2028,\\" said Tony Estanguet, the team's co-chair.      French President Emmanuel Macron also hailed the decision as an \\"important step.\\"      Related: Why nobody wants to host the Olympic Games      President Trump offered his congratulations to Los Angeles in a statement Monday night.      \\"I am confident that the Summer Games in Los Angeles will exemplify both the Olympic ideal and the American spirit, and we look forward to hosting them,\\" Trump said.      This is the first time the Summer Olympics will be held in the U.S. since the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.      Los Angeles also hosted the summer games in 1932 and 1984.      Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti hailed the new arrangement as \\"a major step toward bringing the Games back to our city for the first time in a generation.\\"      \\"What we were able to negotiate, this deal was too good to pass up,\\" Garcetti said Monday night.      He said the planning committee estimates that the games will cost 5.3 billion. The IOC, local sponsorships and ticket sales cover costs, while the city will receive federal support for security, Garcetti said.      -- CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed reporting. ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles has reached an agreement with international Olympic leaders that will open the way for the city to host the 2028 Summer Games.      City Council President Herb Wesson's office confirmed the deal Monday.      Spokeswoman Caolinn Mejza says the pact is expected to be reviewed by the council later this week.      The agreement to be formally announced later Monday follows a vote earlier this month by the International Olympic Committee to seek a deal to award the 2024 and 2028 Games.      Paris is the only city left to host the 2024 Games.      The arrangement would make LA a three-time Olympic city, after hosting the 1932 and 1984 Games.      LA and Paris were the last two bids remaining after a tumultuous process that exposed the unwillingness of cities to bear the financial burden of hosting an event that has become synonymous with cost overruns.      LA was not even the first American entrant in the contest. Boston withdrew two years ago as public support for its bid collapsed over concerns about use of taxpayer cash. The U.S. bid switched from the east to the West Coast as LA entered the race.      But the same apprehensions that spooked politicians and the local population in Boston soon became evident in Europe where three cities pulled out.      Uncomfortably for IOC President Thomas Bach, whose much-vaunted Agenda 2020 reforms were designed to make hosting more streamlined and less costly after the lavish 2014 Sochi Games, the first withdrawal came from his homeland of Germany.      The lack of political unity for a bid in Hamburg was mirrored in Rome and Budapest as support for bids waned among local authorities and the population. It was clear they did not want to be saddled with skyrocketing bills for hosting the Olympics without reaping many of the economic benefits anticipated.      Just like in the depleted field for the 2022 Winter Games which saw Beijing defeat Almaty, the IOC was left with only two candidates again.      With two powerful cities left vying for 2024, Bach realized France or the U.S. could be deterred from going through another contest for 2028 if they lost. Bach floated the idea in December of making revisions to the bidding process to prevent it producing \\"too many losers,\\" building support that led to LA and Paris being able to figure out themselves how to share the 2024 and 2028 Games.      The dual award of the games relieves the IOC of having to test the global interest in hosting the Summer Olympics for several years until the 2032 Games are up for grabs.      ___      AP Sports Writer Rob Harris in London contributed. ||||| Summary:","output":"Los Angeles has agreed a deal with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to host the Summer Olympics in 2028, paving the way for Paris to host the games in 2024. The two cities were the last remaining bidders for 2024 after other cities withdrew due to financial concerns. As part of the agreement, the IOC will provide the Los Angeles organising committee with 1.8bn, part of which will be used to increase youth participation in sport.

A: Choices:  A). lung system;  B). skeletal system;  C). muscular system;  D). digestive system; The answer is:","output":"D). Digestive System. Diarrhea due to food poisoning is an example of a problem involving the digestive system. The digestive system is a vital organ system responsible for breaking down the food we consume, absorbing its nutrients, and converting them into energy to support our body's functions. It includes several organs and structures, such as the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. When food poisoning occurs, harmful bacteria, viruses, or toxins contaminate the food we ingest. Upon entering the digestive system, these harmful agents can disrupt its normal functioning, causing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is a particularly notable symptom as it involves heightened frequency, increased fluid content, or a reduction in solid matter in bowel movements - upsetting the body's process of removing waste and maintaining a balance of electrolytes. As a result, it can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or in severe cases, even organ damage or death. In conclusion, diarrhea due to food poisoning is a problem related to the digestive system, as the ingestion of contaminated food leads to the disruption of the organs within this system, causing discomfort and potentially serious consequences for the individual affected. It is crucial to practice proper food safety and hygiene techniques to minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses and ensure the digestive system functions efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat - Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate - Over a period of days, the animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly - Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active - The animal has entered hibernation mode -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more eating happens, how will it affect more movement.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"In order to analyze the perturbation hypothesis and its effect on the process, we need to consider each step of the process in the context of the hypothesis: 1. The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat. Perturbation: Suppose more eating happens. If the animal consumes even larger quantities of food than usual, it will store more fat in its body. This increased energy storage might hypothetically enable the animal to engage in more movement, as it would have a greater energy reserve to draw from. 2. Winter comes, and the animal finds a place to hibernate. Regardless of the increased food intake, the animal will still reach the point when it needs to find a place to hibernate, since winter and hibernation are part of its natural life cycle. The additional fat storage might, however, provide better insulation for the animal during the hibernation period. 3. Over a period of days, the animal's heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly. The increased fat storage may affect the animal's heart rate and breathing rate during the transition to hibernation. However, these rates will still generally drop when the animal starts to hibernate.  4. Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active. The additional fat storage does not directly affect electrical activity in the brain during hibernation. This process will remain largely unaffected by the perturbation. 5. The animal has entered hibernation mode. Once the animal has entered the hibernation mode, its movement is severely limited. The additional fat storage would not affect the animal's ability to move while in hibernation.  In conclusion, the perturbation of increased eating does have some indirect effects on the process, predominantly in the animal's movement before it begins to hibernate (due to increased energy reserves) and potentially through better insulation during hibernation. However, once in hibernation mode, it is unlikely that there would be a significant increase in movement as hibernation is characterized by its severely limited mobility and metabolic suppression. The greater fat reserves could instead increase the duration of the hibernation period or improve the animal's survival rate during winter."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A:","output":"Title: Helpful and Mostly Reliable - 4 stars I recently downloaded and started using the com.google.android.gms app, and overall, I've been mostly impressed with its range of features and functionality. While not perfect by any means, the app has certainly proven to be more useful and convenient than not. I'd like to share my experience in detail, highlighting both the positive aspects of the app as well as areas where it could be improved. Pros: 1. Seamless Integration with Google Services: Being a Google-developed app, it integrates seamlessly with my existing Google account and other Google services I regularly use. This includes Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Maps, making it easier to access and manage my data across different platforms. 2. Location-Based Services: The app offers a variety of location-based services, such as location tracking and giving real-time updates on traffic conditions. Using it in conjunction with Google Maps has considerably improved my navigation skills and saved me time in avoiding congested routes. 3. Regular Updates and Security: One of the most noticeable advantages of using the app is the regular updates provided by Google. These updates ensure that the app stays current with new features and can quickly respond to emerging security threats and bug fixes. 4. App Management: The app allows for easy management of permissions for my other apps installed on my device. This feature has made it simple to review and adjust app permissions settings, providing greater control over my data privacy. Cons: 1. Battery Consumption: While using the app has been generally smooth, its battery consumption is somewhat higher than I would have expected. The increased use of location-based services and background processes can lead to faster battery depletion. 2. Occasional Performance Issues: There have been a few instances where the app would lag or slow down my device, requiring a restart. While this is not a frequent problem, it can be frustrating when it happens. 3. Complex User Interface: Sometimes, I find the user interface of the app to be overly complex and not as user-friendly as it could be. Navigating through various settings can be challenging, especially for users who may not be as familiar with Google services. In summary, the com.google.android.gms app has proven itself to be a helpful and reliable tool that combines various Google services and provides helpful location-based services. While there are areas where it could be improved, such as its battery consumption and occasional performance issues, its benefits outweigh its drawbacks. I feel confident in awarding the app a 4-star rating and would recommend it to others seeking a powerful tool to manage their Google services and location-based needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Frank's father, Simon, is a B-movie enthusiast who believes in extraterrestrials and shows his favorite movies at the local theater. The city loses its electrical power just as Simon, Jack and her boyfriend Squirrelly exit the theater. They watch an object streaking through the sky and crashing into the museum. Thought to be a meteorite, they later find out it is a craft containing an alien lifeform. Trying to adapt to the Earth's atmosphere, it latches on to the first organism it finds - the museum's most notable exhibit, a frozen Wooly mammoth. A security guard witnesses the revival of the prehistoric elephant, which kills the guard. With the creature on the loose, two government agents, Powers and Whitaker, track Frank down. While the agents and Frank try to figure out what happened and what to do, the mammoth heads into the forest, where it kills anyone it comes across. The beast's path soon brings it to a huge party attended by Jack and Squirrelly. They survive the attack and meet up with Frank and the agents. The mammoth suddenly appears and kills Agent Whitaker while Agent Powers, Frank, Jack and Squirrelly escape. While the mammoth continues its rampage around the town, the government is preparing to detonate a nuclear bomb on the alien-possessed elephant. The group must find a way to take the creature down without destroying their town. After devising a plan to stop the mammoth, Frank, Powers, Jack and Squirrelly are joined by Simon and town sheriff Marion Morrison at the local factory to encase the creature in ice, just like it was before. While en route, Squirrelly is killed by the mammoth, but the plan moves forward at full speed. The mammoth arrives at the factory, and is doused in molten steel.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects.  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring villages practiced extensive agriculture for their food supply. Leaf village used the intentional cultivation of arthropods to help them get better harvests. Tree village didn't do that, they used conventional methods of growing their crops and got smaller harvests but used arthropods for food.  Answer this question please: Which village observed increased yields because of the arthropods? Answer:","output":"Leaf Village observed increased yields because of the arthropods. They intentionally cultivated arthropods, such as bees and other pollinators, to improve their crop pollination, which in turn led to higher crop yields.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what is a jew Context: Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased.

Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and Samoa respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement. This agreement was not divulged to the Sharif of Mecca, who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state.

In this sentence, it is explained that certain adjustments or modifications have been made to better understand the changes occurring within a population. These alterations might be related to the method or procedure used for data collection, the measurement tools involved, or the data analysis process. Although these modifications can contribute to a more precise understanding of the population's evolution, they also create a limitation by making it difficult to directly compare the estimates of the year 2007 with those of prior years.

A rescue cat looks set to be crowned the world's oldest feline after her owners found proof she is a staggering 28-years-old. Pinky who was born in July 1986, which makes her 129 in human years, was taken in by her owners Ann and Bob Higginbottom as a four-month-old kitten and she has lived with the couple ever since in Dunston, Lincolnshire. The pair have documentation of early visits to vets, which prove that at 28-years-old Pinky could be officially the world's oldest cat. Pinky, who is celebrating her 28th birthday, which could make her the world's oldest cat poses next to her birthday cake. The Guinness Book of Records has a cat from Bournemouth called Poppy, listed as the world's oldest, but she died earlier this month aged 24 meaning Pinky could take the crown. Pinky and her brother Perky, who died 10 years ago, were rescued by Bob and Ann after being born on a farm and taken to an RSPCA rehoming centre. This was at a time when Top Gun was wowing cinema audiences, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and Madonna was top of the charts. But these days Pinky now spends her time in the warmth of the couple's greenhouse at their new bungalow or sunning herself as she watches their ornamental Koi. Today retired caterer Mrs Higginbottom said that Pinky was now completely deaf and 'turning into an old lady'. Her owner, Ann Higginbottom of Dunston in Lincolnshire took in Pinky and her brother Perky, when they were just four-month-old kittens. The 73-year-old explained: 'We got her and Perky when they were just four months old. 'She is amazing really, completely deaf now as is to be expected, but her eyesight is still as sharp as ever. 'She is turning into an old lady now, she likes to sit by our Koi pond and just watch them as they swim about. 'She isn't interested in catching them any more, just likes to watch them. 'When we first got them they chose to live in the barn when we lived at the manor house. Mrs Higginbottom says she has proof of Pinky's age as she kept certificates from vets, showing when the cat had vaccinations. 'It was up to them, I imagine it was because they came from a farm and where used to living out there. 'Now she spends her time out in the greenhouse. 'She comes in and likes to be petted but that's just where she likes to be. She does not like being picked up, but nor do many cats.' The oldest cat ever, according to Guinness World Records, died in Texas, USA, in August 2005 at the age of 38 years. Mrs Higginbottom said that she and her husband were now looking to approach Guinness World Records with Pinky's certificates. Other cats have laid claim to the title, but their owners don't have any documentation to prove their pet is the oldest feline. Mrs Higginbottom said that she and retired quantity surveyor Mr Higginbottom, 87, were now looking to approach Guinness World Records with Pinky's certificates. She added: 'It would be incredible for Pinky to be recognised as the world's oldest cat and as far as we can see there is nothing stopping her being crowned that.'

Information:  - A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence  though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace.  - Schio is a town and comune in the province of Vicenza (region of Veneto, northern Italy) situated North of Vicenza and East of the Lake of Garda. It is surrounded by the Little Dolomites (Italian Prealps) and Mount Pasubio.\\"'\\"Which is Sheridan more like, Mantova or Verona or Vicenza? It isn't like any of those. It is right up against the mountains, almost like Schio.\\" \\"Ernest Hemingway\\" History. Its name comes from Latin: escletum was a wood of oaks and it was first used in a document of some Benedictines from Vicenza. The first settlements were around two old hills, where now there are respectively the ruins of an old castle and a majestic neoclassical cathedral.  - An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, four-wheeler, or quadricycle as defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control. As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles. Although it is a street-legal vehicle in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states and provinces of Australia, the United States or Canada.  - A moped (/mopd/ MOH-ped) is a small motorcycle, generally having a less stringent licensing requirement than motorcycles or automobiles because mopeds typically travel about the same speed as bicycles on public roadways. Strictly speaking, mopeds are driven by both an engine and by bicycle pedals, but in common usage and in many jurisdictions the term moped is used for similar vehicles including a scooter, though this is quite erroneous. Mopeds occasionally resemble powered bicycles, more commonly called a motorized bicycle, though since ca. 2006 there has been a glut of engine kits shipped from China (although Tanaka had offered drive kits since the 1960s) designed in theory to transform a standard bicycle into a motor vehicle but lacking the benefit of proper brakes and lighting. In addition, the added stresses can cause the rear rim to warp, and the spokes to break, and if the engine is the least bit out of alignment the drive chain will come off the drive sprocket, causing the rim to warp and the spokes to break, as well as lodging the chain in the chainstay and causing injury to the operator. Some mopeds are of a step-through type design, while others are step-over, or \\"top tank\\", designs, having a motorcycle-like frame, including a \\"backbone\\" and a raised fuel tank (known as a \\"top tank\\" among moped enthusiasts), mounted directly between the saddle and the head tube. Most are similar to a regular motorcycle, only having the addition of pedals, in which the rider can both manually power the vehicle through a bicycle-like crankset in addition to a small displacement engine. Although mopeds usually have two wheels, some regions classify low-powered three- or (rarely) four-wheeled vehicles as a moped. Many(US ?)states have laws on the books that anyone convicted of a DUI cannot legally operate any motor vehicle powered by gasoline for the entire length of their sentence.  - Derbi is a manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters, mopeds and recreational all-terrain vehicles produced by Nacional Motor S.A.U., a Spanish subsidiary of Piaggio & Co.

These are two muscular tubes that carry urine to the urinary bladder. Contractions of the muscles of the ureters move the urine along by peristalsis. The urinary bladder is a sac-like organ that stores urine. When the bladder is about half full, a sphincter relaxes to let urine flow out of the bladder and into the urethra. The urethra is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body through another sphincter. The process of urine leaving the body is called urination. The second sphincter and the process of urination are normally under conscious control.   Q: What is a sac-like organ  that stores urine?   Choices:  - the colon  - the urinary liver  - the small intestine  - the urinary bladder  A:","output":"The sac-like organ that stores urine, as mentioned in the paragraph, is the urinary bladder. The urinary bladder's primary function is to store urine until it is ready to be expelled from the body during urination. The other choices – the colon, the urinary liver, and the small intestine – are not related to the storage or passage of urine. The colon is a part of the large intestine, playing a role in digestion and waste removal. The concept of a \\"urinary liver\\" does not exist; however, the liver does have a crucial role in detoxification and metabolism. The small intestine is involved in the absorption of nutrients during digestion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

By far the best example of the boundaries of hip-hop, \\"Do you want more???\\" is the opus of the Roots. Not to say that their other albums don't hold muster (because they do), but this was truly the best the collective had to offer. The anthem of the Roots is \\"What goes on,\\" which combines the talents of their drummer, ?uestlove, their then-beat boxer Rahzel (since aptly replaced by Scratch) and their MCs, Black Thought and Malik B to create a world of rap in which one could exist forever. Other notable songs on the album include \\"Mellow my man,\\" which exemplifies the tempo changes that are the hallmark of jazz, \\"The lesson,\\" a freestyle-type song over an incredible beatbox courtesy of Rah, and \\"Distortion to static,\\" one of those songs that becomes an immovable force in one's head. If you love music and creativity, this is the one album you must own. Is the review positive or negative? A:","output":"The review is undoubtedly positive. The author praises the album \\"Do you want more???\\" by the Roots as their best work and highlights several aspects that make it exceptional. The album is described as having something to offer to both new listeners and long-time fans of hip-hop. The reviewer emphasizes the talents of the band members - drummer ?uestlove, beatboxers Rahzel and Scratch, and MCs Black Thought and Malik B - and appreciates their ability to create a unique world of rap.  Furthermore, the author notes specific tracks that exemplify the band's innovative approach to music, such as \\"What goes on,\\" \\"Mellow my man,\\" \\"The lesson,\\" and \\"Distortion to static.\\" The mention of tempo changes being the hallmark of jazz and the incredible beatbox in \\"The lesson\\" underline the Roots' ability to stretch the boundaries of hip-hop.

Plot title: Pride Movie plot: Based on a true story, in 1973 Jim Ellis (Terrence Howard) was just out of college looking for work as a math teacher. Jim loved to swim and was an excellent swimmer. However, as the only black swimmer on his college team, Jim encountered discrimination from other teams at swim meets. After being turned down for a teaching job at a private school in Philadelphia, Jim needs money, and he takes a temporary job packing up items at a rundown recreation center that is about to be demolished. Jim finds the pool and brings the pool back to life. Elston (Bernie Mac) the custodian for many years thinks Jim is crazy. Jim thinks he can help some of the kids in the neighborhood by forming the city's first African-American swim team and compete in the state championship meet. Maybe he can even save the P.D.R.

Process: - There is a fetus in the womb - They are born and are a baby - The baby grows into a child - Puberty turns the child into an adolescent - The adolescent becomes an adult - An adult becomes an elderly person - The elderly person dies.  Question: suppose less children become adolescents happens, how will it affect more fetus in womb.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"C: No effect To understand the relationship between the number of children becoming adolescents and the number of fetuses in the womb, we can first assess the developmental stages involved in an individual's life.  The process begins with a fetus forming in the womb during pregnancy. From there, the fetus eventually grows and is born as a baby. As the baby develops physically, cognitively, and emotionally, it transitions through different stages of life, such as child, adolescent, adult, and eventually reaching the elderly stage before their death. Now, if we consider the scenario where fewer children become adolescents, this could be attributed to various factors such as higher child mortality rates, lower birth rates, or a combination of both. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that these factors affect the demographics or population size and growth at large rather than directly impacting the number of fetuses in the womb. The number of fetuses in the womb is solely dependent on the number of pregnancies. Multiple factors can influence the number of pregnancies, including fertility rates, access to reproductive health services, cultural norms, and individual preferences. Additionally, aspects such as the availability of contraceptives, socio-economic circumstances, advancements in fertility treatments, and overall health of the population can impact the number of pregnancies and subsequently the number of fetuses in the womb as well. If a society experiences a decline in the number of children transitioning into adolescence, it may potentially prompt policymakers to modify family planning policies or encourage an increase in birth rates to maintain a sustainable population size. These changes could affect the number of fetuses in the womb indirectly at a later stage, be it an increase or decrease. In conclusion, the number of children becoming adolescents does not have a direct effect on the number of fetuses in the womb. However, it can indirectly reflect certain population growth and demographic trends that may prompt changes to socio-economic factors or policies, which could eventually influence the number of pregnancies. Still, the direct relationship between children becoming adolescents and the number of fetuses in the womb remains non-existent."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an innovator.

Dell's low spending on R&D relative to its revenue (compared to IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Apple Inc.)—which worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and later mobile devices. Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized. Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s, but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete IT solutions and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett Packard and Oracle.

In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions. There were several mitigation schemes in the bill that would have lessened its impact. David Ford of the Alliance Party said it was not clear what would happen now. \\"Within the next couple of weeks we have to resolve the budget issue, not just the June monitoring round - the reallocation between departments in year - but actually to pass the bill to allow departments to spend money in the second half of the financial year,\\" he said. \\"So that's a measure of the crisis we're in, that has to be resolved and it's unclear at this stage how that will be resolved.\\" Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said Sinn Féin was making the vulnerable in Northern Ireland suffer for their political aspirations in the Republic. \\"We now stand closer than ever to the point where we witness the death of democracy in Northern Ireland. This will come when duly elected politicians have to hand over power to a civil servant,\\" he said. TUV leader Jim Allister said \\"the chickens are coming home to roost in the failure of mandatory coalition\\". Shadow NI secretary Ivan Lewis said: \\"All Northern Ireland's parties have to accept responsibility for making the difficult choices necessary to set a viable budget as a matter of urgency.\\" The Northern Ireland parties had agreed a deal on Westminster's welfare reform measures in the Stormont House Agreement last December. However, Sinn Féin withdrew its support in March. What is a summary of this text?","output":"Theresa Villiers is a person who makes important decisions and talks to people from different groups in Northern Ireland. She is trying to find a solution for a problem they are facing. The problem is about something called the Welfare Reform Bill. This bill talks about changes in the support given to people by the government. Some groups in Northern Ireland, like Sinn Féin, SDLP, and the Green Party, did not like this bill. They said they needed more support from different communities before they could accept it. This made Theresa Villiers worry that other people might try to control how Northern Ireland deals with this issue. Martin McGuinness, a man from Sinn Féin, said it would be a big mistake if other people controlled welfare in Northern Ireland. There were many talks and votes about this issue, but they still couldn't find a solution that everyone agreed with. People are worried because they have to fix this problem soon, or it will cause more trouble for everyone. Some people think this situation shows that the groups in Northern Ireland are not working well together. They hope the leaders can find a solution quickly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a question with answer options. Goal: mouth Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Options: a). can consume from forks  b). can consume from pencil ...I think the answer is","output":"a). can consume from forks In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let us first analyze both options and explain why option a is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of mouth. Option A: Can Consume from Forks Forks are primarily designed as a utensil for eating and handling food. They consist of a handle and several tines, which are specifically tailored for various types of food. Forks have been used for centuries in various cultures and have evolved over time to serve different purposes related to food consumption. Here are some key reasons why using forks is a more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of mouth: 1. Practical design: Forks are created with a user-friendly design that eases the process of consuming food. The tines are engineered to help pick up and hold food items, making it easier for users to transfer the food from their plates to their mouths. 2. Hygienic use: Forks help maintain a higher level of hygiene while eating as they minimize direct contact between the hands and the food. Touching food with bare hands can result in the transfer of germs from one's hands to the mouth, potentially causing illnesses. By using a fork, the risk of germ transfer reduces significantly. 3. Versatile uses: Forks can be used to consume a wide variety of food items, ranging from salads to meats to pasta. The utensil is highly adaptable and can fit the requirements of various meals. Option B: Can Consume from Pencil A pencil generally serves as a writing instrument consisting of a thin cylindrical core made of either graphite or a solid pigment, encased within a wooden or other material casing. A pencil's primary function is to create visible marks on surfaces such as paper, which makes it unfit for consumption or accomplishing the goal of mouth. Here are a few reasons that highlight why consuming from a pencil is not reasonable: 1. Unintended purpose: Pencils are intended for writing or drawing purposes, not for food consumption. Using them for eating would be using the tool for a purpose it was not designed for and may potentially lead to damage to the pencil. 2. Safety concerns: The materials used in the construction of a pencil, such as graphite and wood, can cause harm if ingested. Attempting to consume food using a pencil could lead to parts of the pencil breaking off and being swallowed, posing a choking hazard. 3. Inefficiency: Attempting to pick up food using a pencil and transferring it to one's mouth would be a highly inefficient process. The pencil lacks the design features, such as tines, which are present in forks, making it extremely difficult to grip and hold the food properly. In conclusion, it is clear that option A, \\"can consume from forks,\\" is the more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of mouth. Forks are specifically designed for food consumption, ensuring practicality, hygiene, and versatility when eating. On the contrary, using pencils for this purpose would be unsuitable, unsafe, and inefficient due to their construction and the unintended nature of their primary use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tweet:@simple_sy can't am sorry, really wanna come bt bhai is leaving tomorrow....so wanna spend time with him..  there is always a next time","output":"The sentiment of the given tweet can be understood to be a mix of mild disappointment, regret and hope for the future. The tweet implies that the person wants to attend an event or meet with @simple_sy but cannot because they have another significant commitment involving a family member (in this case, the use of \\"bhai\\" suggests the person's brother). There are a few elements in the tweet that contribute to an understanding of the sentiment expressed: 1. “Can’t am sorry”: This phrase indicates disappointment, as the person feels regretful for not being able to attend or meet the other person. The use of \\"am sorry\\" emphasizes their sense of guilt and regret for not being available. 2. “Really wanna come”: This part reveals the desire to attend the event or meet @simple_sy; however, as previously mentioned, the speaker cannot do so. This shows a mixture of regret and disappointment in not being able to fulfill their wish. 3. “Bhai is leaving tomorrow”: The introduction of a conflicting and legitimate reason for not being able to attend offers an explanation for their absence. This reason may evoke a sympathetic understanding, as spending time with family is a common reason for prioritizing and making decisions based on interpersonal relationships. 4. “Wanna spend time with him”: The person emphasizes their wish to spend time with their brother before he leaves. This demonstrates a sentimental value attached to family bonds. It also shows that the person values their time and prefers to engage in meaningful activities (in this case, spending time with family). 5. “There is always a next time”: The final sentiment in the tweet is more positive and hopeful. The sentiment here suggests that the person believes the missed opportunity is not an irreversible loss, and they will have another chance to attend or meet in the future. This more hopeful and forward-looking sentiment counterbalances the overall disappointment expressed in the tweet. In summary, the sentiment of the given tweet can be classified as a mix of mild disappointment, regret, and hope for the future. The person is expressing their desire to attend the event or meet with @simple_sy, but they have a conflicting and meaningful commitment. They hope for another opportunity in the future and thus, leaving the tweet on a more positive note."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the villian character created by Kaufman? is inside the article: Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame.

They were fascinated by genetic variation.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which researcher observed more membranes of two cells merging?  Hint: Prokaryotes have a different way to increase genetic variation. It’s called genetic transfer or bacterial conjugation . It can occur in two ways. One way is when cells “grab” stray pieces of DNA from their environment. The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually plasmids) with other cells. For example, as shown in Figure below , the donor cell makes a structure called an F pilus , or sex pilus. The F pilus attaches one cell to another cell. The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic material, usually a plasmid , moves into the recipient cell. Genetic transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology. It can be used to create bacterial cells that carry new genes. The answer to this question is:","output":"Bill, who studied prokaryotes, observed more instances of two cell membranes merging. This process occurs in prokaryotes as part of genetic transfer or bacterial conjugation, which facilitates the exchange of genetic material. In one of the ways this exchange happens, the donor cell creates an F pilus (also known as sex pilus) that attaches to another cell, causing the membranes of the two cells to merge.

Information:  - The judiciary (also known as the judicial system or court system) is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in the name of the state. The judiciary also provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes. In some nations, under doctrines of separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and applies it to the facts of each case. In other nations, the judiciary can make law, known as Common Law, by setting precedent for other judges to follow, as opposed to Statutory Law made by the legislature. The Judiciary is often tasked with ensuring equal justice under law.  - The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced.

The current governor is Jerry Brown, a Democrat who was inaugurated January 3, 2011, and who had previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983. In October 2013, Jerry Brown surpassed Earl Warren for the longest cumulative period of time served as governor.  - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a crowned republic, Ireland is a parliamentary republic, and the United States is a federal republic.  - Baja California, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California, is a state in Mexico.

Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

Australia election date set Australians will vote on October 9 in an election pitting the conservative government against centre-left Labor, with national security and the economy as major issues. What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the announcement of a scheduled election date in Australia, which is set for October 9. In this election, the conservative government will be competing against the centre-left Labor party. The main issues at the forefront of the electoral campaign are expected to be national security and the economy. The election will provide an opportunity for Australian citizens to exercise their right to vote and decide which party will form the next government. It will also allow both the conservative government and the centre-left Labor party to present their views, policies, and plans regarding key issues like national security and the economy to the voters, in an effort to gain popular support. National security and the economy are pressing concerns for any nation, and they will likely shape the political discourse during the election campaign. National security typically involves matters related to the protection of the country's citizens, borders, and interests from external threats, such as terrorism, cyber attacks, and other potential dangers. The economy encompasses a wide range of topics, including employment, taxation, trade, infrastructure, fiscal policy, and social welfare policies. In the forthcoming Australian election, it is expected that both the conservative government and the centre-left Labor party will outline their respective strategies for addressing these crucial areas. They will likely propose plans for improving and maintaining the nation's economic health, as well as strengthening its security measures to protect its citizens and assets. As the election approaches, the political atmosphere in Australia will likely become more intense, with parties and candidates engaging in debates, public speeches, and campaign events in order to win over potential voters. The Australian people will closely follow the developments leading up to the election and evaluate the competing proposals and ideologies presented by the conservative government and the centre-left Labor party. Ultimately, the October 9 election will determine which party gains control over the government and sets the course for Australia's future, particularly in critical areas such as national security and economic policy. The announcement of the election date marks the beginning of a crucial period in Australian politics, as the country's citizens prepare to make their voices heard and cast their votes for the party they believe will best serve their interests and the well-being of the nation."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Read this and answer the question The interior of Galicia is characterized by its hilly landscape, although mountain ranges rise to 2,000 m (6,600 ft) in the east and south. The coastal areas are mostly an alternate series of rías (submerged valleys where the sea penetrates tens of kilometres inland) and cliffs. The climate of Galicia is temperate and rainy, but it is also markedly drier in the summer, being usually classified as Oceanic in the west and north, and Mediterranean in the southeast. Its topographic and climatic conditions have made animal husbandry and farming the primary source of Galicia's wealth for most of its history. With the exception of shipbuilding and food processing, Galicia was largely a semi-subsistence farming and fishing economy and did not experience significant industrialization until after the mid-20th century. In 2012, the gross domestic product at purchasing power parity was €56,000 million, with a nominal GDP per capita of €20,700. The population is largely concentrated in two coastal areas: from Ferrol to A Coruña in the northwest and from Pontevedra to Vigo in the southwest. To a lesser extent, there are smaller populations around the interior cities of Lugo, Ourense and Santiago de Compostela. The political capital is Santiago de Compostela, in the province of A Coruña.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paolo Rossi (Italian pronunciation: ['pa:olo 'rossi]; born 23 September 1956) is a former Italian professional footballer, who played as a forward. In 1982, he led Italy to the 1982 FIFA World Cup title, scoring six goals to win the Golden Boot as top goalscorer, and the Golden Ball for the player of the tournament. Rossi is one of only three players to have won all three awards at a World Cup, along with Garrincha in 1962, and Mario Kempes in 1978. Rossi was also awarded the 1982 Ballon d'Or as the European Footballer of the Year for his performances. Despite his ban, Rossi was purchased back by Juventus in 1981, and he returned to the starting line-up just in time for the end of the 1981-82 season to contribute to the club's 1981-82 Serie A title (scoring 1 goal in 3 appearances), and to take part in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, with Italy. Italian journalists and tifosi initially lamented that he was in very poor shape, however, and this view seemed to be confirmed by Italy's appalling performance in the three group matches, in which he was allegedly described as a \\"ghost aimlessly wandering over the field\\".  Italy manager Enzo Bearzot, however, staunchly confirmed Rossi for the decisive round robin in the second round, in which his team was to face Argentina, the reigning World Champions, and Brazil, the biggest favourites to win the title, with a team consisting of world-class players such as Socrates, Zico, and Falcao. After Italy defeated Argentina 2-1, also thanks to the defensive work of Claudio Gentile and Gaetano Scirea, who shut down the young Argentinean star Diego Maradona, Rossi scored three memorable goals to defeat Brazil 3-2 to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-final match against Poland, Rossi's two goals won the match for Italy once again, granting them a place in the 1982 World Cup final. In the final against West Germany, Rossi scored the first of Italy's three goals, off of an indirect set-piece assist from Gentile, helping Italy to win the match 3-1, giving his team their third World Cup title. With six goals in total, he won the tournament's maximo goleador award -- the Golden Boot -- as the top scorer of the tournament, as well as the Golden Ball Award for the best player of the tournament, and he was named as part of the team of the tournament for the second consecutive time.  Italian fans hung banners proclaiming him \\"Man of the match\\". Rossi's accomplishments in Spain gained him the title of European Footballer of the Year and World Player of the Year in 1982, as well as the 1982 Onze d'Or Award. Due to his notable goalscoring exploits during the 1982 World Cup in Spain, Paolo Rossi earned the nicknames \\"Pablito\\", and the \\"torero\\".

Information:  - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.  - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin.  - In Greek mythology, Melete () was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses before the Nine Olympian Muses were founded. Her sisters were Aoide and Mneme. She was the muse of thought and meditation. Melete literally means \\"ponder\\" and \\"contemplation\\" in Greek.  - Mnemosyne (or  ), source of the word \\"mnemonic\\", was the personification of memory in Greek mythology. A Titanide, or Titaness, she was the daughter of the Titans Uranus and Gaia. Mnemosyne was the mother of the nine Muses, fathered by her nephew, Zeus:  - In Greek mythology , Mneme / nimi / (  ) was one of the three original ( Boeotian ) muses , along with her sisters Aoide and Melete before Arche and Thelxinoë were identified , increasing the number to five . Later , the Nine Olympian Muses were named . She was the muse of memory .  - Anaximander (\\"Anaximandros\\"; c. 610  c. 546 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils.  - In Greek mythology, Aoede (\\"Aoid\\") was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses, which later expanded to five, before the Nine Olympian Muses were named. Her sisters were Melete and Mneme. She was the muse of voice and song. According to Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Zeus, the King of the Gods, and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory.   - Arche is a Greek word with primary senses \\"beginning\\", \\"origin\\" or \\"source of action\\". (: from the beginning, r : the original argument), and later first principle or element, first so used by Anaximander (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23), principles of knowledge (Aristot. Metaph. 995b8). By extension, it may mean \\"first place, power\\", \\"method of government\\", \\"empire, realm\\", \\"authorities\\" (in plural: ), \\"command\\". The first principle or element corresponds to the \\"ultimate underlying substance\\" and \\"ultimate undemonstrable principle\\". In the philosophical language of the archaic period (8th-6th century BC), \\"arche\\" (or \\"archai\\") designates the source, origin or root of things that exist. In ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the meaning of \\"arche\\" as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.

Write an article with the title: \\"7 Things You Didn't Know About 3D Printing\\" Article:","output":"Title: 7 Things You Didn't Know About 3D Printing Introduction 3D printing, a technology that has been around for over three decades, has experienced rapid acceleration and widespread interest in recent years. It is revolutionizing various industries by providing opportunities, innovation, and customization like never before. From creating intricate art pieces and architectural models to manufacturing tailor-made prosthetics and complex machine components, 3D printing has the potential to transform the way we live and work. In this article, we explore seven lesser-known facts about 3D printing to understand this groundbreaking technology even better. 1. 3D Printing Dates Back to the 1980s Although 3D printing may seem like a relatively new technology, its origins date back to the 1980s. American inventor Chuck Hull created the first 3D printer in 1983, with the technology initially known as \\"stereolithography.\\" Hull's creation laid the groundwork for this burgeoning field and continues to shape the industry today. 2. 3D Printing is Environmentally Friendly Compared to traditional manufacturing processes, 3D printing has a lesser environmental impact. It reduces material waste by only using the necessary amount of material for the object being produced. As a result, energy consumption is also lower during the manufacturing process. Additionally, 3D printing enables the production of lighter and more efficient parts, contributing to a reduction in energy usage and overall carbon footprint. 3. It's Not Just About Plastic When it comes to 3D printing, most people think of plastic as the primary material used. However, a wide variety of materials can be used in 3D printing, depending on the type of printer and the desired outcome. For instance, metal powders like stainless steel, aluminum, and titanium can produce sturdy mechanical parts or medical implants. Researchers also experiment with organic materials, such as living cells and food substances, to create innovative products like artificial organs and edible structures. 4. Space Exploration and 3D Printing Governments and space agencies worldwide are exploring the potential of 3D printing to revolutionize space exploration. NASA, for example, has been developing 3D-printed rocket engine components and instruments, which could significantly reduce the cost of future space missions. In addition, 3D printers have been sent to the International Space Station, enabling astronauts to create much-needed tools and equipment while in space, removing the need to send supplies from Earth. 5. 3D Printing in Medicine and Healthcare In recent years, 3D printing has made an impressive impact on medicine and healthcare. Scientists have successfully used bioprinting – a form of 3D printing that uses living cells as \\"ink\\" – to create artificial organs and tissues. In the future, this could pave the way for finding solutions to organ donor shortages and reduce the need for animal testing. Additionally, 3D printing has been used to produce custom-made prosthetics and implants, which provide a better fit and improved functionality for patients. 6. The World's First 3D Printed Building In 2016, the world's first 3D-printed building, a two-story office, was inaugurated in Dubai. This unique structure was produced using a blend of cement and other building materials, proving that 3D printing is not limited to small objects. The successful creation of this building highlights the potential of 3D-printed construction, which could lead to faster, more cost-effective, and increasingly inventive architectural designs. 7. Intellectual Property and Copyright Concerns With the rise of 3D printing technology, new concerns surrounding intellectual property and copyright have emerged. Unlike traditional manufacturing, 3D printing could potentially allow individuals to replicate patented or copyrighted objects without permission. Governments and organizations are working to adapt legal frameworks to address these challenges.  Conclusion From its beginnings in the 1980s to its current role as an exceptional tool with enormous potential, 3D printing continues to expand in application and influence countless industries. As technology advances and materials evolve, its capabilities will only grow, promising a more innovative and sustainable future. Understanding lesser-known facts like these helps shed light on the incredible impact of 3D printing on our world and offers a glimpse into what is yet to come."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"The Arrival of the three queens is considered what?\\" is in \\"At certain times of the year, The Queen Mary 2, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria may all visit Southampton at the same time, in an event commonly called 'Arrival of the Three Queens'.\\".

Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. While holidaying with her family in December 1920, Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was two years her senior. The two became regular dance partners while Rougier studied at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged. One month later, Heyer's father died of a heart attack. He left no pension, and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. Two months after her father's death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony.  In October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child. Heyer remained at home and continued to write. In 1926, she released These Old Shades, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, These Old Shades focused more on personal relationships than on adventure. The book appeared in the midst of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000 copies. Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel's sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews. She once wrote to a friend that \\"as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.\\"  Rougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika. Heyer joined him there the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass located in the bush; Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen. While in Tanganyika, Heyer wrote The Masqueraders; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former Jacobites. Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one anachronism: she placed the opening of White's a year too early. She also wrote an account of her adventures, titled \\"The Horned Beast of Africa\\", which was published in 1929 in the newspaper The Sphere.  In 1928, Heyer followed her husband to Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family's earnings with her writing.","output":"This text is about Georgette Heyer, an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist.

Summarize: Allowing a few drops of insulin to drop from the needle tip ensures there are no air bubbles and nothing is obstructing the flow of insulin.  Once your pen is ready to use, dial the dose you need to administer.  Using a fresh needle, a primed device, and the correct dose dialed on the pen device, you are ready to administer the injection.  Follow your doctor's instructions on pinching the skin and the angle of entry in order to more effectively administer the insulin. Once you have pushed the thumb button completely in, count slowly to ten before withdrawing the needle.  If you are administering a larger dose, your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider may instruct you to count beyond ten to ensure the dose is properly delivered.  Counting to ten or beyond ensures that you get the full dose intended and helps to prevent leakage from the injection site when you withdraw the needle. Insulin pens and cartridges should not be shared. Even with fresh needles, there is still a significant risk of transferring skin cells, disease, or infection from one person to another.","output":"To use an insulin pen, first ensure there are no air bubbles or obstructions by allowing a few drops of insulin to drop from the needle tip.
