This gives us: [g'(x) = frac{xf'(x) - f(x)}{x^2}.] Given that xf'(x) - f(x) < 0 for x > 0, we can infer that g'(x) < 0 for x > 0.

Third, we have 0.2^2 = 0.04, which is clearly less than 1, and thus less than both 2^{0.2} and log_{2}5. Putting these observations together, we have log_{2}5 > 2^{0.2} > 0.2^2, which implies that g(log_{2}5) < g(2^{0.2}) < g(0.2^2) due to the decreasing nature of g(x) on (0, +infty).

This geometrically means the sum of the distances to point -a and to point a-2017 is greater than 4a. (2) When a leq 0, it is obviously true. When a > 0, since |x+a|+|x+2017-a| geq |-a-a+2017| = |2a-2017|, we have |2a-2017| > 4a, which must satisfy 2017-2a > 4a, solving this gives a < frac{2017}{6}.

An even number is any integer of the form (2k), where (k) is an integer. Therefore, the even numbers between 1 and 1963 are generated by setting ( k = 1 ) to ( 981 ), yielding the sequence ( 2, 4, 6, ldots, 1962 ). 3. **Check Relatively Prime Condition**:     Next, consider the properties of even numbers and the condition of being relatively prime:     - Any two consecutive numbers in the form of (2k) and (2k+1) (one even and one odd) meet the relatively prime condition. An even number is divisible by 2, whereas an odd number is not, ensuring their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.          - However, when considering pairs of even numbers, such as (2k) and (2(k+1)), and two numbers separated by exactly one number (which we need to check), let's take (2k) and (2(k+2)):       - The numbers (2k) and (2(k+2) = 2k + 4) are both even.        - Since the GCD of any two even numbers is at least 2 (because both are divisible by 2), these pairs will not be relatively prime. 4. **Illustrate the Non-possibility**:     - Explicitly, consider an example: the sequence (2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 1962).     - Taking pairs (2) and (4), (4) and (6), and so forth reveals that they share a common divisor of 2, thus, are not relatively prime. 5. **Conclusion**:     Since it's impossible to arrange the sequence from 1 to 1963 wherein every two consecutive numbers and every two numbers separated by one spot keep the relatively prime condition due to the properties of even numbers:     - The requirement that every alternate pair in the list should be relatively prime fails because those alternate pairs would include even numbers, which have a common divisor of 2 and hence cannot be relatively prime.

Hence, option C is incorrect. **Option D:** Given P(B|A)=0.2, which means the probability of B occurring given that A has occurred is 0.2, we can express this as: [P(B|A) = frac{P(AB)}{P(A)} = 0.2] From this, we can find P(AB): [P(AB) = P(B|A) times P(A) = 0.2 times 0.5 = 0.1] For events A and B to be independent, the probability of both occurring, P(AB), must equal the product of their individual probabilities, P(A) times P(B). We calculate this as: [P(A) times P(B) = 0.5 times 0.2 = 0.1] Since P(AB) = P(A) times P(B), we conclude that A and B are independent, making option D correct.

(A) 12  (B) 13  (C) 14  (D) 15  (E) 16","output":"1. **Identify the dimensions and orientation of the garden**: Given the area of the garden is 2100 square meters and one side that uses the rock wall is 70 meters, the other dimension can be calculated as frac{2100}{70} = 30 meters. Therefore, the dimensions of the garden are 70 m and 30 m, with the rock wall on the longer side. 2. **Calculate the number of posts for the 30 m sides**: Each 30 m side has posts every 10 m. Thus, there are frac{30}{10} = 3 intervals, requiring 3 + 1 = 4 posts per side. Since the post at each end (where the fence meets the rock wall) is shared, each 30 m side needs only 4 - 1 = 3 individual posts. 3. **Calculate the number of posts for the 70 m side**: For the 70 m side along the rock wall, where posts are placed every 10 m, there are frac{70}{10} = 7 intervals. Therefore, 7 + 1 = 8 posts are required. 4. **Calculate the total number of posts required**: Summing up all the posts:    - 8 posts along the 70 m side.    - 3 posts for each of the two 30 m sides, giving 3 times 2 = 6 posts.    - Total posts required = 8 + 6 = 14. 5. **Conclusion**: The fewest number of posts required to enclose the garden, using one long side as the rock wall, is 14.

To understand the percentage distribution, we first calculate the total number of stones in this collection: [40 + 60 = 100] 2. **Determine the Percentage of Grey Stones**: Next, we calculate the percentage of grey stones in this collection. Since there are 40 grey stones out of 100, the percentage is: [frac{40}{100} = 0.4] This means 40% of the stones are grey. 3. **Calculate the Percentage of Green Stones**: Knowing that the total percentage must equal 100%, and having found that 40% of the stones are grey, we can determine the percentage of green stones by subtracting the grey percentage from 100%: [1.0 - 0.4 = 0.6] Thus, 60% of the stones are green. 4. **Apply the Same Percentage to the White and Black Stones**: Since Brian's collection of white and black stones has the same percentage distribution as the grey and green stones, and given that there are more white stones than black stones (similar to how there are more green stones than grey stones), we conclude that 60% of the 100 stones in the first collection are white. 5. **Calculate the Number of White Stones**: To find the exact number of white stones, we apply the 60% to the total number of stones in the first collection: [100 times 0.6 = 60] Therefore, Brian has boxed{60} white stones in his collection."},{"instruction":"Dave had some apps on his phone.

The speed of the first train = 120 kmph The speed of the second train = 80 kmph Relative speed = 120 kmph + 80 kmph = 200 kmph To convert the relative speed from kmph to m/s, we multiply by 1000 (to convert kilometers to meters) and divide by 3600 (to convert hours to seconds): Relative speed in m/s = 200 * 1000 / 3600 = 55.56 m/s (rounded to two decimal places) The time taken to cross each other = 9 seconds The combined length of the two trains can be found by multiplying the relative speed by the time taken: Combined length = Relative speed * Time Combined length = 55.56 m/s * 9 s = 500.04 meters We know the length of the second train is 300.04 meters, so we can find the length of the first train by subtracting the length of the second train from the combined length: Length of the first train = Combined length - Length of the second train Length of the first train = 500.04 meters - 300.04 meters = 200 meters Therefore, the length of the first train is boxed{200}  meters."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are denoted as a, b, and c respectively.

Consider a circle rolling along side ( BC ) of ( triangle ABC ), with the center ( O ) and the point of tangency ( K ). The sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) of ( triangle ABC ) intersect the circle at points ( M ) and ( N ) respectively. We need to show that the arc ( MN ) subtends an angle of ( 60^circ ). 1. The circle is tangent to ( BC ) at point ( K ), and sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) of the triangle intersect the circle at ( M ) and ( N ) respectively. 2. The bisector of angle ( A ) is also the perpendicular bisector of the chord ( MN ) since ( ABC ) is equilateral. Therefore, ( O ) lies on this bisector. 3. Since ( ABC ) is equilateral, (angle BAC = 60^circ ). 4. The arc ( MN ) is therefore such that ( angle MAN + angle MAN = angle BAC = 60^circ ). Thus, each arc ( MK ) and ( KN ) contains ( 30^circ ): [ angle MOM = angle MON = 30^circ  ] Hence the total angle subtended by arc ( MN ) (which is ( MK + KN )) is: [ angle MKN = 30^circ + 30^circ = 60^circ  ] So, we have shown that the arc subtended by ( MN ) is ( 60^circ ). The lines drawn from center ( O ) to points ( M ) and ( N ) cut the circle and form angles subtending ( 60^circ ) of the circle's circumference. Therefore the curve confined by the intersection of the circle and two sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) is equal to one-sixth of the circle.  Part (b): Let's proceed to show that the point of concurrency of the perpendicular bisectors always remains inside the triangle. The point of concurrency in an equilateral triangle is the orthocenter. Since the point ( P ) inside the triangle ABC is at equal distances from vertices, the lines perpendicular to the midpoints of sides pass through it.  1. Let's define three perpendicular bisectors from midpoint tangency points.         Observe the configurations of ( PM ), ( PN ) and ( PK ).      2. The internal points in ( triangle ABC ) conform to the orthocenter property:  [  angle PAN = angle PAK = 90^{circ}  ] So, point ( P ) lies inside for all circumstances and remains so because the altitude from the vertex into its respective tangent maintains perpendicularity to its tangent enclosing the point.

Let the root of h(x) = 0 be x_0. Then for 0 < x < x_0, g'(x) > 0, and for x > x_0, g'(x) < 0.

Consider the table:    [    begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}    hline    12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 23     hline    24 & 25 & 34 & 35 & 45     hline    123 & 124 & 125 & 134 & 135     hline    145 & 234 & 235 & 245 & 345     hline    end{array}    ] 2. **Checking for Minimal Coverage**:    Each cell in this table represents a unique combination of figures required to completely cover that part of the rectangle. Here the essential idea is that 1/5 and 1/20 are minimized estimations for the area necessary to ensure coverage. 3. **Explaining Why Larger Values Fail**:    We need to show that larger values cannot cover the same configuration without missing some parts or overlapping inefficiently.        - If we replace 1/5 by any larger value, say (a > frac{1}{5}), then the composite structures that require multiple 1/5 parts would overflow. For instance, covering an area that requires 3(1/5) would then require (3a > 3 times frac{1}{5} = frac{3}{5}), which would exceed the necessary area and lead to overlaps.        - Similarly, if 1/20 were replaced by a larger value (b > frac{1}{20}), the coverage would also exceed the necessary area. For example, covering an area needing 4(1/20) would then require (4b > 4 times frac{1}{20} = frac{1}{5}), again resulting in excess coverage and overlaps. 4. **The Coverage Scheme Validity**:    The given values 1/5 and 1/20 ensure the accuracy of the coverage. These values ensure no part is left out, nor is there excessive overlap. # Conclusion: Therefore, replacing 1/5 and 1/20 with larger values would fail to accurately cover the rectangle as specified in the problem setup. Thus, the estimations 1/5 and 1/20 are precise and cannot be replaced by larger values.

Let circle S_1 have center O_1 and circle S_2 have center O_2. Let the radii be r and R respectively. 2. Since the circles S_1 and S_2 are externally tangent, their centers and the point of tangency form a straight line. Therefore, the distance between O_1 and O_2 is r + R.  3. Let the external tangent line touch S_1 at point A and S_2 at point B. By the problem's conditions, the line O_1A and the line O_2B are both perpendicular to the tangent line AB. 4. Since O_1A perp AB and O_2B perp AB, we have that O_1A parallel O_2B. This implies that quadrilateral O_1ABO_2 is a trapezoid. 5. We label the point M as the intersection point of the diagonals AO_2 and BO_1 of quadrilateral O_1ABO_2. 6. By the conditions, point M lies on one of the circles. Suppose without loss of generality M lies on circle S_1. 7. Since M is on S_1, the segment O_1M is a radius of this circle, hence O_1M = r. 8. Consider triangles MO_1A and MBO_2. These triangles are formed by the diagonals intersecting at M. We observe that angle MO_1A = angle MBO_2 due to the alternate interior angles theorem considering O_1A parallel O_2B. 9. Likewise, angle BO_1M = angle AO_2M. Moreover, since MO_1A and MBO_2 share two equal angles and both have a side along M, these triangles must be isosceles with O_1M = AM and O_2M = BM. 10. Being isosceles, MO_1 = AO_1 which gives O_1M = r, and MO_2 must be equivalent to O_2B = R. 11. From the problem, M lies on circle S_1, hence angle AMO_1 = angle BMO_2 and triangle MO_1A is also an isosceles triangle with O_1M = r, thus AB = 2R considering the length between O_1 and O_2. 12. Finally, in the isosceles triangle formed by the diagonals, M divides the tangent of the circles in the ratio corresponding to their radii. Therefore, for a consistent solution, the height from O_1 must measure half of O_1B. 13.

Buses on route 152 arrive every 5 minutes, so the arrival times can be represented as ( x ) minutes past his arrival time where ( 0 leq x < 5 ).

Let M be the intersection point of the segments PQ and RS. 3. **Sinusoidal Rule Application**:      Using the sine rule in triangles AMP and CMQ, we get:    [    frac{AM}{AP} = frac{sin epsilon}{sin varphi}    quad text{and} quad    frac{CM}{CQ} = frac{sin epsilon}{sin varphi}    ]    Hence,    [    frac{AM}{CM} = frac{AP}{CQ}    ] 4. **Proving the Unique Intersection Point**:      Let M' be the intersection point of AC and RS.

This holds true for BD as well. 5. **Orthogonal Segments**:      Next, we need to prove that in a bicentric quadrilateral (both cyclic and tangential), the segments connecting opposite tangency points are perpendicular to each other.    Since  alpha + gamma = 180^circ , the central angles subtending the arcs widehat{SP} and widehat{RQ} together sum to 180^circ. Therefore, the corresponding inscribed angles sum to half of that:    [    angle PRS + angle RPQ = 90^circ    ]    As angle PRS = angle PRM and angle RPQ = angle RPM, this means segments PQ and RS are indeed perpendicular. 6. **Circumcenter on Line MO**:      Finally, we show that the center O of the circumcircle lies on the line MO.

This is because the sum changes by at most two of the terms ( a_{n+1} ) and ( a_{n+26} ):      [      |S(n) - S(n+1)| = |a_{n+1} - a_{n+26}| leq |a_{n+1}| + |a_{n+26}| = 2      ] 3. **Evaluate the Sum of ( S )'s:**        Since the total sum of all ( a_i ) is zero, consider four specific sums as follows:    [    S(0) + S(25) + S(50) + S(75) = a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{100} = 0    ]    This means the overall sum of ( S(0), S(25), S(50), ) and ( S(75) ) is zero.     4. **Show Signs of ( S(n) ):**        Since ( S(n) ) is always an odd number, and sum of these four evaluations is zero, ( S ) must take both positive and negative values. To see this, assume ( S ) did not do so:        - If all ( S(n) ) were positive, their sum, being non-zero and positive, would contradict the fact that the overall sum is zero.        - If all ( S(n) ) were negative, we again contradict the zero-sum requirement. 5. **Find Contradiction and Conclude:**        Therefore, there must be indices ( n ) and ( n+1 ) such that ( S(n) ) and ( S(n+1) ) have opposite signs. Without loss of generality, let's say ( S(n) > 0 ) and ( S(n+1) < 0 ). Given Property III, the sums must be (| S(n) - S(n+1) | leq 2). The only solutions under these circumstances are:    [    S(n) = 1 quad text{and} quad S(n+1) = -1    ] 6. **Verification and Conclusion:**    Thus, there exists at least one ( n in {0, 1, ldots, 75} ) such that:    [    S(n) = boxed{1}    ]"},{"instruction":"Among 6 internists and 4 surgeons, there is one chief internist and one chief surgeon.

Thus, the number of ways is boxed{120}. (2) To include both internists and surgeons, we subtract the number of teams with only internists or only surgeons from the total possible teams. The total ways to select 5 members from 10 doctors is binom{10}{5} = 252. The ways to select 5 internists (which is not possible since there are only 6 internists) or 5 surgeons (also not possible since there are only 4 surgeons) are 0. However, selecting all members from one specialty would be binom{6}{5} + binom{4}{5} = 6 + 0 = 6. Therefore, the number of ways is 252 - 6 = 246. Thus, the number of ways is boxed{246}. (3) To include at least one chief, we subtract the number of teams without any chiefs from the total possible teams. The total ways to select 5 members from 10 doctors is binom{10}{5} = 252. The ways to select 5 members without including the chiefs (from the remaining 8 doctors) is binom{8}{5} = 56. Therefore, the number of ways is 252 - 56 = 196. Thus, the number of ways is boxed{196}. (4) To include both a chief and surgeons, first consider the teams with at least one chief. As calculated in (3), there are 196 ways. From these, we need to subtract the teams that include chiefs but no surgeons. There are 2 chiefs, and selecting the remaining members from the 6 internists gives binom{6}{4} = 15 ways for each chief, totaling 15 times 2 = 30 ways. Therefore, the number of ways is 196 - 30 = 166. However, this calculation does not account for the possibility of including both chiefs, which adds additional valid configurations. Including both chiefs and selecting the remaining 3 members from the 4 surgeons gives binom{4}{3} = 4 ways, and selecting the remaining 3 members from the 6 internists gives binom{6}{3} = 20 ways. Adding these to the initial calculation, the corrected number of ways is 166 + 4 + 20 = 190.

Thus, we have the equation:    [    B = 3A    ]    Substituting the expressions for (A) and (B), we get:    [    10^5 b + 10^4 c + 10^3 d + 10^2 e + 10 f + a = 3 (10^5 a + 10^4 b + 10^3 c + 10^2 d + 10 e + f)    ] 4.

Rearrange the terms to collect all terms involving (a) on one side:    [    10^5 b + 10^4 c + 10^3 d + 10^2 e + 10 f + a - 3 cdot 10^5 a - 3 cdot 10^4 b - 3 cdot 10^3 c - 3 cdot 10^2 d - 30 e - 3 f = 0    ]    [    10^5 b - 3 cdot 10^4 b + 10^4 c - 3 cdot 10^3 c + 10^3 d - 3 cdot 10^2 d + 10^2 e - 30 e + 10 f - 3 f + a - 3 cdot 10^5 a = 0    ]    Simplifying this gives:    [    7 cdot 10^4 b + 7 cdot 10^3 c + 7 cdot 10^2 d + 7 cdot 10 e + 7 f = 299999 a    ]    which simplifies to:    [    299999 a = 7 cdot (10^4 b + 10^3 c + 10^2 d + 10 e + f)    ]    [    42857 a = 10^4 b + 10^3 c + 10^2 d + 10 e + f    ] 6. We recognize that (10^4 b + 10^3 c + 10^2 d + 10 e + f) is a five-digit number. Therefore, (42857 a) must also be a maximum of five digits. Given that (a) is a non-zero digit, it can only be 1 or 2 since (42857 times 3) would exceed five digits. 7. Solving for when (a = 1):    [    42857 times 1 = 42857    ]    Thus, the original number must include the permutation of (428571):    [    142857    ] 8. Solving for when (a = 2):    [    42857 times 2 = 85714    ]    This dix-digit number should be (285714). 9. Conclusion. Upon further verification, these numbers meet the given conditions.

Among any set of four consecutive integers, at least two of them must be even, ensuring the product is divisible by at least ( 2^2 = 4 ).

To consider divisibility by larger primes, notice that we have increased the number of consecutive integers from three to four, but the fundamental arithmetic properties mean no higher fixed prime divisor is guaranteed in every case of four consecutive numbers as they could be consecutive primes or products thereof, besides 2 and 3. Multiplying these together, the product of any four consecutive integers is always divisible by ( 2^2 times 3 = 12 ). Now, let's take an example to confirm: Consider ( n = 1 ), so the integers are ( 1, 2, 3, 4 ). The product is ( 1 times 2 times 3 times 4 = 24 ).

So, each tree A gives her: 10 oranges/tree * 60% = 6 good oranges/tree From tree B, each tree gives her 15 oranges a month, and 1/3 of them are good.

Hence, the minute hand must be dividing the total 360 degrees of the clock into two equal angles when measured. 4. **Calculate Possible Angles**:    - There are two unique situations to consider since the minute hand forms two angles with the hour hand: the smaller angle or the reflex angle (which is 360^{circ} minus the smaller angle).    **Case 1**: The hour hand was originally at 30^{circ} / 2 = 15^{circ} before moving 30^{circ}.    - This means the initial angle between the hour and minute hand was 15^{circ}.    - After one hour, since the minute hand is back in its initial position, the hour hand now reads 15^{circ} + 30^{circ} = 45^{circ}.    - The angle remains 15^{circ} because the minute hand, initially at 0^{circ}, divides the 45^{circ} arc into two (itself and beyond to return to 0^{circ}).    **Case 2**: The hour hand was initially at 360^{circ} - (15^{circ} + 180^{circ}) = 165^{circ} on the opposite side.    - This means the reflex angle between hour and minute hand could be 165^{circ} initially.    - After one hour, the minute hand comes back to 0^{circ}, and now hour hand moves 30^{circ} forward to form 195^{circ} (165^{circ} + 30^{circ}) with the minute hand with the minute hand again dividing the 360 clock into equal parts approaching 165^{circ}. 5. **Conclusion**:    - The angles that Anya could have measured initially which stayed the same after one hour can either be 15^{circ} or 165^{circ}.

Let R_{k} denote the number of zeros used to pad these numbers to k-digits. 2. **Formulas and Bounds:**     The total number of digits in n+1 numbers (from 0 to n) is given by:     [     Q_{n} + R_{k} = (n+1) k     ]     Since R_{k} represents only padding zeros and actual digit requirement is relatively less, we can write:     [     (n+1) k < n(k+1)     ]     for n > 1 and taking into account possible additional zeros only through padding almost negligible. 3. **Counting Zeros (R_k):**    Zeros appear in each decimal position cyclically. For numbers with less than k digits, they are padded and for the total zeros including padded zeros, we have:      [     R_{k} = 1 + 10 + 10^2 + ldots + 10^{k-1} = frac{10^k - 1}{9}     ]    This denotes the total zeros used in padding through positions up to 10^{k-1}.    We note:     [     0 < R_{k} < frac{10}{9} cdot 10^{k-1} < 2n     ]     for n ge 10^{k-1}. 4. **Distribution of Zeros (S_n):**     Let S_{n} denote the total number of zeros after accounting for actual zero presence. Decompose it position-wise:     [     S_{n} = S_{n}(1) + S_{n}(2) + ldots + S_{n}(k)     ]     Zeros follow cyclic patterns in each positional place following distribution akin to:     [     n+1 le 10 S_{n}(j) < n + 10^j     ]     all contributing to forming limits of form:     [     k n < k(n+1) le 10 S_n < k n + 10 cdot frac{10^{k} -1}{9} < (k+12) n     ] 5. **Relation between P_{n} and Q_{n}:**     Computing the bounds:     [     P_{n} = S_n - R_k < frac{k+12}{10} cdot n     ]     and      [     P_{n} = S_n - R_k > frac{k}{10} n - 2n = frac{k-20}{10} cdot n     ]     Therefore effectively bounded within:     [     frac{k-20}{k+1} cdot frac{1}{10} < frac{P_{n}}{Q_{n}} < frac{k+12}{k-2} cdot frac{1}{10}     ] 6. **Taking Limits:**     As n rightarrow infty, k also grows indefinitely. Both bounds achieve convergence:     [     lim_{n to infty} frac{P_{n}}{Q_{n}} = frac{1}{10}     ] Thus, confirming the proposed limit. This completes the proof. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Which of the following statistical features must belong to a given data set?

Let's introduce a function ( f(n) ) that captures this process:    [    f(n) = sum (text{digits of } n)^{2013}    ]    Essentially, ( f(n) ) computes the sum of each digit of ( n ) raised to the 2013-th power.  3. We now need to examine the behavior of this sequence, specifically, whether it can include duplicate values for some ( i neq j ). 4. Consider any number ( n ) made up of digits. If ( n ) has up to ( k ) digits, its maximum value is ( 9^k ).

Thus, f(x) has a maximum at x = frac{3}{2}, and the maximum value is: [fleft(frac{3}{2}right) = ln2 - frac{3}{2} + 2 = ln2 + frac{1}{2}.] Therefore, the extreme value of f(x) is boxed{ln2 + frac{1}{2}}, and there is no minimum value.

Analyzing the behavior of g(t): - For t in (0, e), g'(t) > 0, indicating g(t) is increasing. - For t in (e, +infty), g'(t) < 0, indicating g(t) is decreasing.

Can it be achieved that all numbers at the vertices of the cube are divisible by 2?","output":"To solve this problem, we analyze the properties of the sum of the numbers in the vertices of the cube and how they change with each operation. 1. **Initial Configuration**:    - Initially, the numbers at the vertices of the cube are such that one vertex has the number (2021) and the rest (0). Thus, the initial sum of the numbers at the vertices is:      [      text{Sum} = 2021 + 0 + 0 + ldots + 0 = 2021      ]    - Since (2021) is an odd number, the initial sum is odd. 2. **Operation**:    - The only allowed operation is to add (1) to the numbers at both ends of any edge. Each such operation increases the sum of the numbers by (2), as both vertices at the ends of the edge gain (1) each.    - Let's denote an operation by adding (1) to the numbers at vertices (v_1) and (v_2) connected by an edge. Hence, the new numbers at these vertices become (a_1 + 1) and (a_2 + 1) respectively.

[      text{Odd number} + 2k = text{Odd number} quad text{for any integer } k.      ]    - Thus, after any number of operations, the sum of the numbers in the vertices will always remain odd, because starting from an odd number (2021) and continuously adding even numbers ((2, 2k)) to it cannot change its parity from odd to even. 4. **Conclusion**:    - For all the numbers at the vertices to be even, their sum also needs to be even, because the sum of even numbers is always even.    - However, since the sum remains odd no matter how many operations are performed, it is impossible for all the vertices to have even numbers at the same time.

The axis of symmetry passes through two opposite vertices. 2. The axis of symmetry passes through the midpoints of two opposite sides.  Case 1: Axis of Symmetry Passes Through Two Opposite Vertices Consider a convex quadrilateral ABCD with an axis of symmetry passing through opposite vertices ( A ) and ( C ). Let this axis of symmetry be line ( AC ). Since ( AC ) is an axis of symmetry: - ( AB = AD )  - ( BC = DC ) This means the opposite sides of the quadrilateral have equal sums: [ AB + CD = AD + BC ] By the Converse of Pitot's Theorem, a quadrilateral is circumscribed about a circle if and only if the sums of its opposite sides are equal. Therefore, in this case, the quadrilateral ABCD is circumscribed about a circle.  Case 2: Axis of Symmetry Passes Through the Midpoints of Opposite Sides Consider a convex quadrilateral (ABCD) with an axis of symmetry passing through the midpoints of opposite sides ( AB ) and ( CD ). Since ( AB ) and ( CD ) are symmetric with respect to the axis, ( angle A + angle C = pi ) and ( angle B + angle D = pi ). This is a restatement that the sum of each pair of opposite angles of the quadrilateral is ( 180^circ ). According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, a quadrilateral can be inscribed in a circle if and only if the sum of its opposite angles is ( 180^circ ). Thus, in this case, the quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in a circle ( angle A + angle C = 180^circ ) and ( angle B + angle D = 180^circ ), verifying that it meets the criteria. # Conclusion: - If the axis of symmetry passes through two opposite vertices, then the quadrilateral is circumscribed. - If the axis of symmetry passes through the midpoints of opposite sides, then the quadrilateral is inscribed. Thus, we have shown that a convex quadrilateral with an axis of symmetry is either inscribed in a circle or circumscribed about a circle.

Prove that it is possible to seat the 5 people around a circular table such that any two adjacent people know each other.","output":"1. **Representing People as Points:** To start, we represent the 5 people in the company as 5 distinct vertices of a graph, denoted as A, B, C, D, and E. 2. **Drawing Connections Based on Acquaintanceship:**    - If two people know each other, we draw a red edge between the corresponding vertices.    - If two people do not know each other, we draw a blue edge between the corresponding vertices.        This results in a complete graph K_5 with its edges either colored red or blue. 3. **Absence of Monochromatic Triangles:**    - According to the problem, any 3 people must contain at least one pair who know each other and one pair who do not know each other.     - This condition implies that there cannot be a triangle in the graph where all 3 edges (sides of the triangle) are of the same color. Therefore, no set of three vertices forms a monochromatic triangle. 4. **Degrees and Edge Colors at Each Vertex:**    - In a graph K_5 consisting of 5 vertices, each vertex is connected to 4 other vertices.    - We show that each vertex is connected by exactly 2 red edges (which denote acquaintances) and 2 blue edges (which denote non-acquaintances).  5. **Proof by Contradiction:**    - Assume a vertex A is connected to 3 vertices B, C, D by red edges. This implies A knows B, C, and D.    - By the problem's condition, among B, C, and D, at least two do not know each other. Without loss of generality, assume B and C do not know each other. This means the edge BC is blue.    - But now consider the edges BC, CD, and DB. This subgraph must have at least one red and one blue edge among any three vertices, which contradicts the fact that we have a set A, B, C, D with 3 red edges from A.    Hence, no vertex can be connected to 3 others by red edges (or blue edges). 6. **Forming the Cycle:**    - Since each vertex connects to exactly 2 vertices by red edges and 2 by blue edges, we can trace a cycle through the graph using only red edges.    - Suppose that cycle is A-B-C-D-E-A. Each vertex has 2 red edges and maintains acquaintance with adjacent vertices in the cycle.    7. **Conclusion:**    - Arrange the 5 people around a circular table in the order that corresponds to the vertices in the red cycle.    - According to this arrangement, each person knows their neighboring persons, fulfilling the problem's requirement that adjacent persons know each other. Thus, the problem's constraints allow for arranging the 5 people such that adjacent individuals are acquaintances. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given that point O and point F(2,0) are the center and left focus of the hyperbola frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}y^{2}=1(a > 0), respectively.

Solving for y_{0}^{2}, we get y_{0}^{2}=frac{x_{0}^{2}}{3}-1 (x_{0}geqslant sqrt {3}). Now, overrightarrow{FP}=(x_{0}+2,y_{0}) and overrightarrow{OP}=(x_{0},y_{0}).

Conclusion: Every figure F with diameter 1 can be enclosed in a square Q with side 1. blacksquare  b) Prove that any figure F with diameter 1 can be enclosed in a circle K with radius frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. 1. Consider any figure F with diameter 1. This implies that the maximum distance between any two points in F is 1. 2. To enclose F in a circle K of radius R = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, note that the diameter of K is 2R = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. 3. The value of frac{sqrt{3}}{3} approximates to approximately 0.577. Therefore, 2R < 1, i.e., the diameter of circle K does not exceed 1. 4. Thus, a circle K of radius frac{sqrt{3}}{3} can enclose F such that none of its points are outside the circle. Conclusion: Every figure F with diameter 1 can be enclosed in a circle K with radius frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. blacksquare  c) Conclude that any figure F with diameter 1 can be enclosed in a regular hexagon P. 1. Refer to the previous part (b). Since the figure F with diameter 1 can be enclosed in a circle K with radius frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, let's verify the other statement about the sides. 2. Consider the radius of the circle K = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, which fits around the diagonal or side of the hexagon P. 3. Therefore, a circle with diameter 1 can fit within the regular hexagon if frac{sqrt{3}}{3} corresponds to the center to any edge length in hexagon properties. Conclusion: Any figure F with diameter 1 can be enclosed in a regular hexagon P. blacksquare  d) Prove that any figure F with diameter 1 can be enclosed in an equilateral triangle T with side sqrt{3}. 1. Consider any figure F with diameter 1. 2. To show placing F inside an equilateral triangle T, a triangle with side length sqrt{3} must enclose the largest span or diameter. 3. The height of equilateral triangle T with side sqrt{3} is frac{sqrt{3} cdot sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{3}{2} = 1.5. 4. This means the triangle has sufficient height to contain the given figure F if the longest diagonal in F does not exceed the triangle metrics.

In this problem, the random variable X sim N(3,1) has a mean mu = 3 and standard deviation sigma = 1. Therefore, P(2 leq X leq 4) represents the probability that X is within one standard deviation from the mean. Since the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, P(X < 2) is equal to P(X > 4). Thus, we can use the symmetry to calculate the desired probability. The area under the curve of the normal distribution from -infty to mu + sigma (which is from -infty to 4 in this case) is 0.5 + frac{0.6826}{2} = 0.5 + 0.3413 = 0.8413 (i.e., 50% for -infty to mu plus half of the probability within one standard deviation). To find P(X > 4), we subtract this area from 1:  P(X > 4) = 1 - P(X leq 4) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587.

How much money would Collin have to put into savings?","output":"First, let's find out how many cans Collin collected from his grandparents' house. Since he found three times as many cans at his grandparents' house as he did at home, we multiply the 12 cans he found at home by 3: 12 cans * 3 = 36 cans from his grandparents' house. Now, let's add up all the cans he collected: 12 cans (from home) + 36 cans (from grandparents) + 46 cans (from neighbor) + 250 cans (from dad's office) = 344 cans in total. Next, we need to calculate how much money he would earn from these cans. Since he earns 0.25 per can, we multiply the total number of cans by 0.25: 344 cans * 0.25/can = 86.00 earned.

Mathematically, this can be written as:    [    sigma(n) - n + d(n) = n    ]    where ( d(n) ) is the number of positive divisors of ( n ). 2. Rearrange the equation:    [    sigma(n) + d(n) = 2n    ] 3. Let ( n = 2^k prod_{i} p_i^{n_i} ) be the prime factorization of ( n ), where ( p_i ) are distinct odd primes. 4. The sum of the divisors function ( sigma(n) ) for ( n = 2^k prod_{i} p_i^{n_i} ) is given by:    [    sigma(n) = left( sum_{j=0}^{k} 2^j right) left( prod_{i} left( sum_{j=0}^{n_i} p_i^j right) right)    ] 5.

Formally:    [    P = prod_{m in X} m    ]    Note that ( P ) is not relatively prime to any element in ( X ) because it shares common factors with each element. 3. **Find the Smallest Such Integer**:    Define ( n ) as the smallest positive integer which is not relatively prime to any element of ( X ). This ( n ) must exist due to the finiteness of ( X ). 4. **Existence of a Divisor in ( X )**:    Since ( n ) is chosen such that no element of ( X ) is relatively prime to ( n ), and given ( m in X ), ( m ) must divide ( n ).

Thus, it follows that ( m' ) is not relatively prime to ( n' ). Considering our construction, ( p ) must divide ( m' ). Consequently:      [      p mid m'      ]     9. **Greatest Common Divisor**:    Since ( p ) divides both ( m_0 ) and ( m' ), we can state:    [    gcd(m_0, m') = p    ]    Since ( p ) is a prime number, the greatest common divisor of ( m_0 ) and ( m' ) is a prime number. # Conclusion: Hence, we have shown that ( X ) either contains a prime number or contains two elements whose greatest common divisor is a prime number: [ boxed{text{Q.E.D.}} ]"},{"instruction":"f set A={0, 4}, and B={2, a^2}, then a=2 is a ( ) condition for A cap B = {4}.

Let's go through the steps in detail: 1. **Representation in Base Related to 50:**    - Given a positive integer ( A ), we perform repeated division by 50, recording the quotient and remainder at each step until the quotient becomes zero.    - Let ( r_1 ) be the remainder from the division of ( A ) by 50, and ( A_1 ) the quotient.    - Continue this process with ( A_1 ) to get ( r_2 ) as the remainder and ( A_2 ) as the quotient, and so on. 2. **Expression of ( A ) in Terms of remainders:**    - After ( n ) steps, the representation of ( A ) in terms of its remainders when divided by 50 can be written as:      [      A = r_n cdot 50^{n-1} + r_{n-1} cdot 50^{n-2} + cdots + r_2 cdot 50 + r_1.      ] 3. **Rewriting ( A ) to Identify Terms Divisible by 7:**    - Rewrite the above equation by isolating terms that are clear multiples of 49 (since ( 50 - 1 = 49 ) and 49 is divisible by 7):      [      A = r_n cdot (50^{n-1} - 1) + r_{n-1} cdot (50^{n-2} - 1) + cdots + r_2 cdot (50 - 1) + R,      ]    where ( R = r_n + r_{n-1} + cdots + r_1 ) is the sum of the remainders. 4. **Divisibility by 7:**    - Notice that each term ( 50^i - 1 ) is divisible by 49 and hence divisible by 7.    - Therefore, ( A ) is divisible by 7 if and only if ( R ) is divisible by 7.     Thus, the number ( A ) is divisible by 7 if and only if the sum of the remainders ( R = r_n + r_{n-1} + cdots + r_1 ) is divisible by 7. 5. **Generalization to m:**    - We generalize this process to another number ( m ). To find a similar rule for another ( m )-divisibility, we choose a base ( g ) such that ( g = k cdot m + 1 ) for some integer ( k ).    - For such a base, we again find the sum of remainders when repeatedly dividing ( A ) by ( g ). 6. **Divisibility by 13:**    - For ( m = 13 ), choose ( g = 40 ) (since ( 40 = 3 cdot 13 + 1 )).    - The same steps apply, and thus, we conclude: the number ( A ) is divisible by 13 if and only if the sum of the remainders from division by 40 is divisible by 13. # Conclusion: For the number ( A ), 1.

The problem states that her output per hour increases by 100 percent, so her new rate with an assistant is 2(B/H) bears per hour. Let's denote the number of hours Jane works per week with an assistant as H'.

There are 2^{12} = 4096 possible combinations of genders for the 12 grandchildren. The scenario where Mr. Chen has an equal number of grandsons and granddaughters will occur when he has exactly 6 of each. The number of ways to pick 6 grandchildren out of 12 to be boys (with the rest being girls) is represented by binom{12}{6}. Calculating binom{12}{6}:  binom{12}{6} = frac{12!}{6!6!} = frac{479001600}{86400} = 924  Thus, the probability that Mr. Chen has exactly 6 grandsons and 6 granddaughters is:  frac{binom{12}{6}}{2^{12}} = frac{924}{4096} = frac{231}{1024}  Therefore, the probability that Mr. Chen has more grandsons than granddaughters or more granddaughters than grandsons is:  1 - frac{231}{1024} = boxed{frac{793}{1024}}"},{"instruction":"f ellipse E_1: frac{x^2}{a_1^2} + frac{y^2}{b_1^2} = 1 and ellipse E_2: frac{x^2}{a_2^2} + frac{y^2}{b_2^2} = 1 satisfy frac{a_1}{a_2} = frac{b_1}{b_2} = m (m > 0), then these two ellipses are said to be similar, and (m) is called the similarity ratio.

Since (M_1) is similar to (M_2), we have frac{1}{a^2} = 2frac{1}{b^2} and frac{1}{a^2} + 2frac{1}{b^2} = 1. By substituting the first equation into the second, we obtain a^2 = 2 and b^2 = 1. Thus, the standard equation of ellipse (M_1) is boxed{frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1}. (II) Let line (l) have slope (k). Suppose it intersects (M_1) at points (A(x_1, y_1)) and (B(x_2, y_2)), and let (F) be the right focus of (M_1) at (F(1, 0)). From the condition overrightarrow{AF} = lambda_1 overrightarrow{FG}, we have -y_1=lambda_1 y_2.

Substituting this into the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1, we get (3-2x_1)y^2 + 2y_1(x_1-1)y - y_1^2 = 0. From here, we find that y_1 y_2 = frac{-y_1^2}{3-2x_1}, so lambda_1 = 3 - 2x_1. When line (AG) is perpendicular to the x-axis, (x_1 = 1), and thus both lambda_1 = 1 and lambda_2 = 3 - 2x_1 hold true. Similarly, we derive lambda_2 = 3 - 2x_2. Using the equation of line (l) as y=k(x+2), we substitute into the ellipse equation to get (2k^2+1)x^2 + 8k^2x + 8k^2 - 2 = 0. From the fact that this quadratic must have two distinct real roots for (x) (since the line intersects the ellipse at two points), we deduce 0 < k^2 < frac{1}{2}. Thus x_1 + x_2 = -frac{8k^2}{2k^2+1} and x_1 x_2 = frac{8k^2 - 2}{2k^2 + 1}.

The first pipe can fill the cistern in 10 hours, so its rate is: P1 = 1 cistern / 10 hours = 1/10 cistern/hour The second pipe can fill the cistern in 12 hours, so its rate is: P2 = 1 cistern / 12 hours = 1/12 cistern/hour The third pipe can empty the cistern in 20 hours, so its rate is negative (since it's emptying the cistern): P3 = -1 cistern / 20 hours = -1/20 cistern/hour When all three pipes are opened simultaneously, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: Combined rate = P1 + P2 + P3 Combined rate = (1/10) + (1/12) - (1/20) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

Can there exist two such moments when the hour and minute hands are mutually perpendicular? 1. **Initial Assumption**: Assume that there exist moments when the hour and minute hands are mutually perpendicular. 2. **Time Interval Calculation**:     - For the hour and minute hands to be in a straight line, the relative angle between them must be 180 degrees. This could happen when the minute hand is exactly opposite to the hour hand at intervals of 6 n + 3 hours, where n is an integer. 3. **Perpendicular Condition**:     - For the hands to be mutually perpendicular, the relative angle between them must be 90^circ.      - Normally, within each clock cycle (12 hours), the hour and minute hands are perpendicular 22 times. However, we need to consider this in multiples of 180 degrees from our initial straight line assumption. 4. **Contradiction**:     - If the hour and minute hands form a straight line at a moment referenced by a certain 6n + 3 hours and they reproduce this configuration, then they cannot additionally subdivide such that an exact 90^circ configuration appears uniquely between every 180^circ straight line formation.      - The calculation of moments (positions) would absolutely contradict the stipulated intervals frac{360^circ}{11} per hour for 22 possible 90-degree configurations, none of which would perfectly coincide with the straight-line intervals. 5. **Conclusion**:     - Given the contradiction in the position-based interval, our initial assumption must be false.

The academic administration can change the upper limit of the scale to any other natural number, recalculating the grades proportionally and rounding to the nearest whole number. A noninteger value rounds to the nearest whole number; if the fractional part is 0.5, the direction of rounding is at the discretion of the academic administration and can be chosen individually for each grade. (For example, a grade of 37 on a scale of 100 will be converted to the scale of 40 as 37 cdot 40 / 100 = 14.8 and rounded to 15.) Students Petya and Vasya received grades (a) and (b), which are neither 0 nor 100. Prove that the academic administration can make several recalculations such that Petya's grade changes to (b) and Vasya's grade changes to (a) (both grades are recalculated simultaneously).","output":"1. **Introduction and Notation**:    - The problem involves converting and rounding grades from one scale to another.    - We start with grades ( a ) and ( b ) which are different from 0 and 100.    - Let's denote a grade of ( a ) out of 100 as ( frac{a}{100} ).    - Extreme grades are ( frac{0}{100} ) and ( frac{100}{100} ). 2. **Lemma 1**:     - **Statement**: If we change the scale sequentially from 100 down to 2 (i.e., (100 rightarrow 99 rightarrow 98 rightarrow ldots rightarrow 3 rightarrow 2 )), then any non-extreme grade ( frac{a}{100} ) will eventually become ( frac{1}{2} ).    - **Proof**:       - Note that as we scale down, non-extreme grades remain non-extreme because:        - For all ( k > 1 ), the grade ( frac{1}{k} ) is closer to any non-extreme grade ( frac{a}{k+1} ) than to ( frac{0}{k} ). Therefore, after rounding, you will not get 0 or ( 1 ).        - The same logic applies for the upper bound. So the grades remain in the range up to ( frac{k}{k} ).      - Hence, after reducing to a 2-point scale, you obtain ( frac{1}{2} ). 3. **Lemma 2**:    - **Statement**: Given a natural number ( k ), by changing the scales in the sequence ( 2 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 4 rightarrow 6 rightarrow 8 rightarrow ldots rightarrow 2 cdot 2^s rightarrow 3 cdot 2^s rightarrow ldots rightarrow 2^k ), any grade starting from ( frac{1}{2} ) can be converted into any grade of the form ( frac{2r + 1}{2^{2k}} ) where ( 0 leq r < 2^{k-1} ).    - **Proof**:      - **Base case** ( k = 1 ): The initial condition is ( frac{1}{2} ).      - **Induction step**: Assume the statement is true for ( k ).        - Consider ( r ) being odd and extend the reasoning. Initially, for some non-extreme ( r ), get ( frac{r}{2^{k-1}} ). By scaling and rounding, reach ( frac{3r + 1}{2} ). Converting to the next scale gives ( frac{2r+1}{2^k} ). 4. **Lemma 3**:    - **Statement**: Any non-extreme grade ( frac{a}{100} ) can be derived from an initial odd-grade scale of 256.    - **Proof**:      - Assume ( frac{a}{100} ) cannot be obtained. Then within the interval ( (frac{a}{100} - frac{1}{200}, frac{a}{100} + frac{1}{200}) ), there is no fraction of the form ( frac{2r+1}{256} ).      - The length of this interval is ( frac{1}{100} ), but the distance between adjacent such fractions is ( frac{1}{128} ).      - This leads to a contradiction since ( frac{1}{128} < frac{1}{100} ). 5. **Conclusion**:    - First, using Lemma 1, convert both grades ( a ) and ( b ) to ( frac{1}{2} ).    - Next, applying Lemma 2, get any odd grades in 256-scale.    - Finally, using Lemma 3, ensure that any needed non-extreme grades exist in the range [0, 100].

However, we can interpret the problem as needing the sum of the resulting numbers to end in 0. 2. **Determine the number of splits needed:**    - To ensure the sum of the resulting numbers ends in 0, we need to split the sequence into 10 different numbers.

By the basic properties of geometry, a line and a point not on the line uniquely determine a plane.

We are given that the number (99N) is made of only digit threes.  2. First, we note that (99 = 3 times 3 times 11). Thus, for (99N) to be composed entirely of threes, (N) should be such that (99N) is a number containing only the digit 3.  3. For a number to be consisting of only the digit 3, it must be of the form (33333ldots3). For simplicity, let's denote (99N) with all digits equal to (3) as (33ldots 3). 4. The smallest (N) will be where (99N) is the smallest multiple formed by all threes.  5. To find the smallest (N), analyze (33N). Since (99 = 3 times 33), we should find (N) such that (33N) is a number of ones, (11ldots1). We look for the smallest number of ones forming a multiple of (33). 6. Recall the divisibility rule of (3): the sum of the digits should be divisible by (3). Since each digit is (1), this implies that the total number of digits must be a multiple of (3). 7. Furthermore, for the number to be divisible by (11), the difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of the digits in even positions should be (0) or a multiple of (11). Since (1) is alternating, this simplifies to the number of digits being even. 8. Combining these findings, the smallest number of such digits satisfying both is a multiple of (3 times 2 = 6). 9. The smallest such number made entirely of ones with 6 digits is (111111). 10. Given that (33N = 111111), [ N = frac{111111}{33} ] 11.

Let H be the orthocenter of triangle ABC. Consider the points H_{1}, H_{2}, and H_{3} which are the reflections of H with respect to the sides BC, CA, and AB, respectively. 2. These points H_{1}, H_{2}, and H_{3} lie on the circumcircle of triangle ABC (from Problem 5.10). 3. Let l be a line passing through the point H. A line symmetric to l with respect to side BC intersects the circumcircle at the reflection point H_{1} and another point P_{1}. Similarly, the symmetric lines with respect to CA and AB intersect the circumcircle at the reflection points H_{2} and H_{3} and the corresponding points P_{2} and P_{3}. 4. Now, consider another line l', passing through H, making an angle varphi with line l. Construct the points P_{1}', P_{2}', and P_{3}' corresponding to the symmetric reflections of l' in the same manner as P_{1}, P_{2}, and P_{3} were constructed for l.  5. The angle angle P_{i} H_{i} P_{i}' = varphi. Hence, the arc P_{i} P_{i}' subtends an angle of 2 varphi, because the rotation from points P_{i} to P_{i}' is twice the angle varphi due to symmetry. 6. Thus, P_{1}', P_{2}', and P_{3}' are images of P_{1}, P_{2}, and P_{3} under a certain rotation about the orthocenter H.  7. Clearly, if l' is selected to be one of the altitudes of the triangle, say the altitude from vertex A, then P_{1}' = P_{2}' = P_{3}' = A, implying that P_{1} = P_{2} = P_{3}.  Conclusion: Therefore, the three lines symmetric to any given line through the orthocenter intersect at exactly one point.

To be precise:        - There are ( n ) elements ( {a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{n-1}} ). Each ( a_i mod (2n-1) ) covers one distinct residue for ( 0 leq i leq n-1 ).    - Additionally, consider ( a_i + a_j mod (2n-1) ) will cover all sums up to ( a_{n-1} + a_{n-1} ). 3. **Counting Distinct Sums:**    - We have ( n ) elements generating distinct residues modulo ( 2n-1 ).    - These residues are ( {0, 1, 2, ldots, 2n-2 } ).    - Therefore, there are ( 2n-1 ) unique elements given by the sum combinations ( a_i + a_j mod (2n-1) ).    - Including the maximum sum ( a_n + a_n = 4n-2 ), adding this, we end up with ( 2n+n=3n) sums in total. 4. **Verifying and Conclusion:**    - The sums generate a broad set from ( 0 ) up to ( 4n-2 ).    - As our arrangement verifies that ( a_i+a_j) span these elements by the unique summing proceeding (  a_{i} + a_{j} mod 2n-1 ), ensuring no overlaps apart from component constraints.    - Example with ( a_i = i ) for ( 0 le i le n-1) and ( a_n =  2n-1 ) accommodates every combination reaching up to anticipated (0, 1, 2, cdots , 3n-2, 4n-2).

Therefore, one of the numbers must be a power of 2 and the other must be a power of 5. 3. Let ( p = 5^a ) and ( q = 2^b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers. Since ( p ) and ( q ) do not end in zero, ( a ) and ( b ) must be at least 1. 4. We need to determine the last digit of ( p - q ). Since ( p = 5^a ) and ( q = 2^b ), we need to consider the last digits of these numbers:    - The last digit of ( 5^a ) is always 5 for any positive integer ( a ).    - The last digit of ( 2^b ) cycles through 2, 4, 8, and 6 as ( b ) increases. 5. We now consider the possible last digits of ( p - q ):    - If ( q equiv 2 pmod{10} ), then ( p - q equiv 5 - 2 equiv 3 pmod{10} ).    - If ( q equiv 4 pmod{10} ), then ( p - q equiv 5 - 4 equiv 1 pmod{10} ).    - If ( q equiv 8 pmod{10} ), then ( p - q equiv 5 - 8 equiv -3 equiv 7 pmod{10} ).    - If ( q equiv 6 pmod{10} ), then ( p - q equiv 5 - 6 equiv -1 equiv 9 pmod{10} ). 6. From the above calculations, the possible last digits of ( p - q ) are 1, 3, 7, and 9. 7. The only digit that does not appear in the list of possible last digits is 5. The final answer is (boxed{5})."},{"instruction":"a deck of cards consisting only of red and black cards, the probability of picking a red card is frac{1}{5}.

What is the maximum number of acute triangles with vertices in these points?","output":"To solve the problem of finding the maximum number of acute triangles that can be formed with 16 points on a circle, we need to perform the following steps: 1. **Calculate the Total Number of Triangles:**     The number of ways to choose 3 points from 16 is given by the binomial coefficient binom{16}{3}.     [     binom{16}{3} = frac{16 cdot 15 cdot 14}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 560     ]     Hence, there are 560 triangles in total. 2. **Count the Number of Non-Acute Angles:**     Notice that for a triangle to be non-acute, at least one of its angles must be non-acute (i.e., geq 90^circ). To count these, consider a chord in the circle, and the triangles formed with a vertex at one end of the chord:          - For each integer m from 1 to 7, pick a chord such that there are exactly m selected points on one side of the chord (not including the endpoints). This we call an m-chord.          - Each m-chord subtends at least m non-acute angles. This is because if you pick any points other than the endpoints along an m-chord, you will always form an angle ge 90^circ.          Now, count the number of such chords and their contributions:     - For m leq 6, there are exactly 16 m-chords for each m, contributing to 16m non-acute angles.     - For m = 7, there are exactly 8 7-chords.

Draw a line through the center of the 16-gon that is not parallel to the line joining V_1 and V_8, and such that all points lie on the same side of the line.     Reflect these points to get V_1', V_2', ldots, V_8'. The set of points {V_1, V_2, ldots, V_8, V_1', V_2', ldots, V_8'} is such that no pair of points is diametrically opposite, and all 7-chords subtend exactly 8 non-acute angles.

For instance, starting with:    [    1 = frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{10}    ]    we can decompose (frac{1}{2}) as:    [    frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6}    ]    and (frac{1}{5}) as:    [    frac{1}{5} = frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{30}    ]    and so on.

Let:    [    1 = frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{a_1} + cdots + frac{1}{a_k}    ]    be one of the representations with the maximum length (k). 5. **Extending the Representation**: By applying the fact to the last term (frac{1}{a_k}):    [    frac{1}{a_k} = frac{1}{a_k + 1} + frac{1}{a_k(a_k + 1)}    ]    we get a new representation:    [    1 = frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{a_1} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{k-1}} + frac{1}{a_k + 1} + frac{1}{a_k(a_k + 1)}    ]    This new representation has more terms than the supposed maximum length (k), which is a contradiction. 6. **Conclusion**: Since we can always extend the representation by decomposing the last term, there must be infinitely many representations of the form:    [    1 = frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_n}    ]    where (5 < a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_n).

Since both A and B have 16 numbers to choose from, there are a total of 16 possible numbers that each can select. The total number of outcomes when both A and B select a number is therefore 16 * 16 = 256. The number of favorable outcomes, where A and B select the same number, is 16. This is because there are 16 numbers, and for each number, there is exactly one way that both A and B can select that same number. Therefore, the number of outcomes where A and B do not select the same number is the total number of outcomes minus the number of favorable outcomes: 256 (total outcomes) - 16 (matching outcomes) = 240 (non-matching outcomes). The probability that A and B will not win a prize in a single trial (i.e., they select different numbers) is the number of non-matching outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: Probability (not winning a prize) = Number of non-matching outcomes / Total number of outcomes Probability (not winning a prize) = 240 / 256 Probability (not winning a prize) = 15 / 16 So, the probability that A and B will not win a prize in a single trial is boxed{15/16} ."},{"instruction":"When the repeating decimal 0.overline{35} is expressed as a common fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of its numerator and denominator?","output":"To convert the repeating decimal 0.overline{35} into a fraction, let's denote it by x.

Answer: Anaëlle has (2^n) possibilities.","output":"To solve the problem, we will use a combinatorial and bijective approach. Here is the detailed step-by-step explanation: 1. **Identification of Chains**:    - For every odd integer ( t ) within the range ( 1 leq t < 2n ), consider the set of bricks with labels in the form ( t cdot 2^k ). This set of bricks is referred to as the chain starting at ( t ). 2. **Assignment Constraints**:    - The problem requires that for each ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n ), the pieces labeled ( k ) and ( 2k ) must be placed in different boxes.    - As soon as one piece from a chain is placed into a box, the placement of the other pieces in the chain is uniquely determined due to the given condition. Specifically, if the piece labeled ( k ) is placed in one box, then the piece labeled ( 2k ) must be placed in the other box. 3. **Independent Placement of Chains**:    - Since the integers ( t ) are odd and each chain involves numbers computed as ( t cdot 2^k ), chains do not overlap. Hence, placing pieces from different chains is independent of each other. 4. **Examination of Representative Pieces**:    - Each tile is in exactly one chain. Because no two different chains will have overlapping pieces, the condition affects only those numbers that are within the same specific chain.    - Therefore, each allowed distribution of pieces can be seen as an independent placement of one representative piece per chain (consider the piece with the lowest label in that chain, particularly the odd numbered pieces). 5. **Calculating the Number of Distributions**:    - Since for each chain, we are free to decide into which box the representative (odd numbered) piece goes, and there are ( n ) such chains, we have ( 2^n ) different ways to distribute the representative pieces.    - For each choice of placing the representative piece, the rest of the pieces in its corresponding chain are uniquely determined by the condition. # Conclusion: Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the ( 2n ) pieces into two boxes such that each pair ( (k, 2k) ) in the set ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) and ( {2, 4, ldots, 2n} ) is in different boxes is  [ boxed{2^n} ]"},{"instruction":"Prove that there are infinitely many composite numbers in the sequence 1, 31, 331, 3331, ldots.","output":"**I. megoldás:** 1.

For a = 10 and p = 31:    [    10^{30} equiv 1 pmod{31}    ] 4. Extending this, for any positive integer k:    [    (10^{30})^k equiv 1^k equiv 1 pmod{31}    ] 5. Therefore, 10^{30k} - 1 is divisible by 31 for any positive integer k. 6. As a result, 31 divides all numbers of the form 10^{30k} - 1. 7. Consider numbers formed by repeating the digit 3 for 30k times:    [    underbrace{333 ldots 333}_{30ktext{ times}} = frac{10^{30k} - 1}{3}    ]    Since 10^{30k} - 1 is divisible by 31, this means that:    [    31 mid frac{10^{30k} - 1}{3}    ] 8.

To prove that 17 divides 10^{16k+9} - 7, we need to show:    [    10^{16k+9} equiv 7 pmod{17}    ] 5. Using properties of congruences for the base 10 modulo 17:    [    10^{16k+9} = 10^9 cdot (10^{16})^k    ]    Knowing that 10^6 equiv 1 pmod{17}:    [    10^{16} = (10^6)^2 cdot 10^4 equiv 1^2 cdot 10^4 equiv 10^4 equiv 4 pmod{17}    ] 6.

The addition of 360^circ represents a full rotation on the unit circle, which does not change the value of the sine function. Therefore, sin(300^circ) = sin(-60^circ). Next, we use the property that the sine of a negative angle is the negative sine of the corresponding positive angle. This gives us sin(-60^circ) = -sin(60^circ). Then, we know that sin(60^circ) is a standard angle whose value is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Thus, sin(300^circ) = -sin(60^circ) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. In a step-by-step summary: 1.

Find the maximum possible number of good diagonals.","output":"# Problem:  In a convex n-gon, several diagonals are drawn. A diagonal is called good if it intersects exactly one other drawn diagonal at an interior point. Determine the largest possible number of good diagonals. We need to find the maximum number of good diagonals in a convex n-gon.  To solve this, we will use the following lemma:  Lemma: In a convex n-gon, there cannot be more than n-3 diagonals that do not have common interior points. Let's first prove by induction on n that the number of good diagonals does not exceed n-2 if n is even, and n-3 if n is odd. We will treat a line segment as a 2-gon without diagonals.  Base Cases: For n=2 and n=3, the claims are obvious.  Induction Hypothesis: Assume the statements are true for polygons with fewer than n geqslant 4 vertices.  Induction Step: Consider a convex n-gon P = A_1 A_2 ldots A_n. If no two good diagonals intersect, by the lemma, their number does not exceed n-3. Now, suppose there are at least two intersecting good diagonals, say A_i A_k and A_j A_{ell} with i < j < k < ell. Each of these diagonals does not intersect with other drawn diagonals. Remove A_i A_k and A_j A_{ell} from consideration. Each remaining drawn diagonal d is either a diagonal or a side of exactly one of the polygons Q_1 = A_i ldots A_j, Q_2 = A_j ldots A_k, Q_3 = A_k ldots A_{ell}, or Q_4 = A_{ell} ldots A_n A_1 ldots A_i (see Figure 1). If d is a side of one of these polygons, it cannot intersect any other diagonals (and is not good). # Case 1: n is even: By the induction hypothesis, the number of good diagonals among all diagonals in any polygon Q_s does not exceed the number of its vertices minus 2. Therefore, the total number of good diagonals in P does not exceed 2 + (j-i-1) + (k-j-1) + (ell-k-1) + (n-ell+i-1) = n-2, as required. # Case 2: n is odd: The sum of the number of vertices in polygons Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, and Q_4 equals the odd number n+4. Thus, the number of vertices in one of these polygons is odd. The corresponding term in the sum will decrease by 1, and we get that the total number of good diagonals does not exceed n-3. The induction step is complete. Thus, for even n, the maximum number of good diagonals is n-2. For odd n, it is n-3. # Examples: 1. **Even n:**    Consider a convex n-gon with n even. Draw diagonals A_i A_{n-i} and A_{i+1} A_{n-i+1} for all i=1,2, ldots, frac{n}{2}-1 (see Figure 2). They are divided into pairs of intersecting good diagonals. 2. **Odd n:**    Draw such diagonals in a (n-1)-gon (even number of vertices). Thus, the solution matches the possible maximum number of good diagonals. # Conclusion: The maximum number of good diagonals in a convex n-gon is: [ boxed{n-2 text{ for even } n,  n-3 text{ for odd } n} ]"},{"instruction":"The localities boldsymbol{A} and boldsymbol{B} on the Earth's surface lie on the same parallel.

To determine if the arc along this parallel provides the shortest distance from A to B, one must consider the definition of a great circle.    - A great circle is the largest possible circle that can be drawn on a sphere, dividing the sphere into two equal hemispheres. It has the same center and radius as the sphere. 4. The shortest distance between any two points on the surface of a sphere is along the arc of a great circle that passes through these points. 5. Since the parallel is not a great circle, the shortest distance between A and B cannot be along the arc of the parallel. 6. Instead, the shortest distance between points A and B would be the arc of a great circle that passes through these points.  7. Now consider A and B lying on the same meridian.     - A meridian is a circle of constant longitude passing through the poles of the Earth. Meridians are great circles. 8.

For the numerator: [ |1-2i| = sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2} = sqrt{1 + 4} = sqrt{5} ] For the denominator: [ |3-i| = sqrt{3^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{9 + 1} = sqrt{10} ] Now, dividing the modulus of the numerator by the modulus of the denominator gives us: [ |z| = frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{10}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{5}sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] Therefore, the modulus of z is boxed{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}."},{"instruction":"Choose two of the five numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to make a twodigit number.

For the tens place, each of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 can appear, but we must exclude 0 because a two-digit number cannot start with 0. So, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as possible tens digits. Each of these will be used as the tens digit in 6 different numbers (since we can use the same number multiple times and there are 6 options for the ones place). Therefore, the sum contributed by each tens digit is 10 times the digit value multiplied by 6 (the number of times it appears). Sum from tens place = (1+2+3+4+5) * 10 * 6 For the ones place, each of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 can appear, and they can each be used 5 times (since 0 cannot be used in the tens place, but it can be used in the ones place, and there are 5 options for the tens place).

We aim to construct an infinite subset ( B subseteq A ) such that the sum of elements in any finite subset of ( B ) has a prime factor not in ( P ). 2. **Base Case**: Start by selecting an arbitrary element ( b_1 in A ) and include it in ( B ). Thus, ( B = {b_1} ). 3. **Inductive Step**: Assume we have a finite subset ( B = {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n} subseteq A ) that satisfies the condition. We need to find another element ( a in A setminus B ) to add to ( B ). 4. **Contradiction Assumption**: Suppose we cannot find such an element ( a ). This implies that for every ( a in A setminus B ), there exists a finite subset ( {b_{i_1}, b_{i_2}, ldots, b_{i_k}} subseteq B ) such that the sum ( a + b_{i_1} + b_{i_2} + cdots + b_{i_k} ) has all prime factors in ( P ). 5. **Infinite Set ( S_k )**: Let ( k ) be an integer such that there exists an infinite set ( S_k subseteq A ) where for each ( a in S_k ), ( k + a ) has all prime factors in ( P ). 6. **Finite Solutions for ( j neq k )**: For any integer ( j neq k ), we claim there are only finitely many integers ( b ) such that both ( j + b ) and ( k + b ) have all prime factors in ( P ). This is because each ( j + b ) and ( k + b ) corresponds to a solution of the form ( d(p^2) - d(q^2) = |j - k| ) for some ( d mid prod_{p in P} p ). Since ( P ) is finite, there are only finitely many such ( d ), and thus finitely many solutions. 7. **Constructing ( B ) Inductively**: Using the elements of ( S_k ) greater than ( k ), we can construct ( B ) inductively. Start by choosing an element in ( S_k ) greater than ( k ). Suppose we have a finite number of elements in ( B ) and want to add another. The number of integers that cannot be added to our set is finite from our earlier claim, so choosing a sufficiently large element in ( S_k ) suffices. This process can continue indefinitely. 8. **Conclusion**: If the contradiction assumption is false, we can continue our initial method of construction indefinitely, ensuring that ( B ) remains infinite and satisfies the required condition.

Each advisor finds the correct answer to any question with probability ( p ) and the wrong answer with probability ( q = 1  p ). If both advisors give the same answer, the king follows their advice.

He then summoned the advisors and said:  It seems to me that the probability of making the correct decisions won't decrease if I keep only one advisor and follow their advice.

Merlin, honest in all other matters, decides to give such an answer that minimizes the probability of his dismissal. What is the probability that Merlin will be dismissed?","output":"We need to determine whether Merlin will be fired under the given conditions. Let's analyze the situation step-by-step. 1. **Understanding the probabilities when there is one advisor**:     - With one advisor, say with a probability (p) of being correct, King Arthur will follow the correct advice with probability (p). 2. **Understanding the probabilities when there are two advisors**:     - If both advisors give the same answer, they are either both correct or both incorrect.         - Both advisors are correct: This occurs with probability (p^2) because each advisor has a probability (p) of being correct.         - Both advisors are incorrect: This occurs with probability (q^2) where (q = 1 - p). 3. **Probability distribution for different outcomes**:     - Both advisors give the correct answer: The king follows their advice with certainty (p^2 times 1).     - Both advisors give the incorrect answer: The king follows their incorrect advice with certainty (q^2 times 1).     - One advisor gives a correct answer and the other gives an incorrect answer: This occurs with probability (2pq). Since King Arthur flips a coin, he follows the correct advice with probability (frac{1}{2}). Thus, the effectiveness in this scenario is (2pq times frac{1}{2} = pq). 4. **Calculating the total probability of the king making the correct decision when he has two advisors**:     [     mathrm{P}(text{Correct Decision with Two Advisors}) = p^2 times 1 + q^2 times 0 + pq = p^2 + pq     ] 5. **Simplifying the expression**:     [     mathrm{P}(text{Correct Decision with Two Advisors}) = p^2 + pq     ] 6. **Since (p + q = 1)**:     [     p + q = 1 implies q = 1 - p     ]     [     therefore mathrm{P}(text{Correct Decision with Two Advisors}) = p^2 + p(1 - p) = p^2 + p - p^2 = p     ]     This shows that the probability of making the correct decision with one advisor is also (p). 7. **Conclusion on redundancy and decision to fire one advisor**:     - Since the probability (p) for making the correct decision remains unchanged with either one or two advisors, it indicates redundancy in maintaining two advisors. Therefore, one can be fired without affecting the decision-making accuracy of King Arthur. 8. **Considering Merlin’s strategic answer**:     - Merlin must consider the impact of his response on his job security. Persifal is honest and would say the optimal solution is to fire one of them because it doesn’t decrease the probability of making correct decisions.     - Merlin, thinking about minimizing his chance of being fired, would realize his optimal strategy aligns with being honest, as the correct answer is evident. 9. **Likelihood of being fired**:     - Since Merlin would say the same as Persifal (to fire one), the chance of Merlin being the one fired would be based on a coin flip if King Arthur decides to follow through with the dismissal.

Next, we need to consider the children who have two flags of different colors but not all three. We can add the percentages of children with two different colors but subtract the percentage of children who have all three colors to avoid double-counting: - Blue and red (50%) + red and green (30%) + blue and green (10%) = 90% - Subtract the 10% who have all three colors: 90% - 10% = 80% So, 80% of the children have two flags of different colors, and 10% have all three different colors.

When 5 litres of water are added to the mixture, the total volume of the mixture becomes ( 15 + 5 = 20 ) litres.

Since no alcohol was added or removed when the water was mixed in, the amount of alcohol in the original mixture and the new mixture should be the same.

Finally, we'll calculate the probability based on these numbers. **Step 1: Calculate the total number of possibilities.** The original program list consists of 5 student performances. When we add two teacher performances, we essentially have 7 slots to arrange these performances. However, since the order of the two teacher performances matters, we need to consider this in our calculation. First, we choose where to insert the first teacher's performance among the 6 possible slots (before, between, and after the student performances). This can be done in {C}_{6}^{1} ways. Next, for each choice of the first teacher's performance, we have 2 choices for the order of the two teacher performances (either the first teacher goes first or the second teacher goes first). This gives us {A}_{2}^{2} ways. Additionally, we can directly choose 2 slots out of the 6 for the teacher performances without considering their order, which gives us {A}_{6}^{2} ways. Therefore, the total number of possibilities is calculated as: [Total = {C}_{6}^{1}{A}_{2}^{2}+{A}_{6}^{2} = 6 times 2 + frac{6 times 5}{1 times 2} = 12 + 30 = 42] **Step 2: Calculate the number of ways in which the two teacher performances are adjacent.** To have the two teacher performances adjacent, we can consider them as a single unit. This gives us 6 possible positions for this unit (before the first student performance, between any of the student performances, and after the last student performance). This can be done in {C}_{6}^{1} ways. Within this unit, the two teacher performances can be arranged in {A}_{2}^{2} ways. Therefore, the number of ways in which the two teacher performances are adjacent is: [Adjacent = {C}_{6}^{1}{A}_{2}^{2} = 6 times 2 = 12] **Step 3: Calculate the probability that these two teacher performances are adjacent.** The probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (adjacent teacher performances) to the total number of possibilities: [Probability = frac{Adjacent}{Total} = frac{12}{42} = frac{2}{7}] Therefore, the probability that these two teacher performances are adjacent is boxed{frac{2}{7}}.

In other words, A and B are equidistant from the circle's center O and form a pair of congruent tangent segments. 4. **Finding Additional Properties**:    - Draw the line OT_A and OT_B. Because OT_A perp AT_A and OT_B perp BT_B, OT_A and OT_B are radii.    - Define the point M as the midpoint of segment AB.  5. **Proving the Midpoint Condition**:    - Since PA = PB and we have symmetrical properties around the line passing through O, T_A, and T_B, point M will lie on the segment joining the midpoints of AT_A and BT_B.    - Due to symmetry, the line connecting T_A and T_B must be either parallel to AB (and thus to line l) or divide segment AB into two equal parts. 6. **Conclusion Using Symmetry**:    - The symmetry of the configuration ensures the required property: the line through T_A and T_B is either parallel to line l or bisects segment AB at midpoint M. Therefore, we have proved that if the tangent segments from points A and B to the circle are equal, then the line passing through the points of tangency (T_A and T_B) is either parallel to the given line l or bisects the segment AB.  boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given that frac{1+i}{1i}=a+bi (i is the imaginary unit, a, b∈R), find the value of ab.","output":"Solution: By frac{1+i}{1-i}= frac{(1+i)^{2}}{(1-i)(1+i)}= frac{2i}{2}=i=a+bi, we get a=0, b=1.

There are 7 children, and the number of ways to choose 2 out of 7 is given by the binomial coefficient:    [    binom{7}{2} = frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = frac{7 cdot 6}{2 cdot 1} = 21    ]    Hence, there are 21 different pairwise meetings. 3. **Distribution of Visits:** We know that each child visits the booth exactly three times, so the total number of visits by all children is:    [    7 text{ children} times 3 text{ visits/child} = 21 text{ visits}    ] 4. **Contradiction Observation:** Since each of the 21 meetings involves two children, and we assumed that no more than two children meet at one time, we can calculate the number of people involved in these meetings by considering the 21 meetings while ensuring no repetition:    - The first time two children meet, there are 2 distinct children at the booth.    - For each subsequent meeting, at least one new child must be present since no three children meet simultaneously. Thus, the next 20 meetings must introduce 20 new \\"visitations\\" from children. 5. **Overcounting the Meetings:** Because only 7 children are involved, and each child only visits 3 times, the maximum number of individual visits is 21.

To achieve this, he wants to reseat the vacationers each time in such a way that none of them sits in the same place twice and each vacationer and the director have a new neighbor to their right each time. How can this be done?","output":"Let's break down the provided plan in more detail: 1. **Numbering the participants**:    - Number the resting participants from 0 to 59. This gives us 60 participants in total, as specified by the problem. 2. **The arrangement for the first day**:    - On the first day, let's arrange the participants in a sequence starting from the director's seat (denoted as position 0) clockwise around the table.     - The sequence is (0, (0-1) mod 60, (0-1+2) mod 60, (0-1+2-3) mod 60, ldots, (0-1+2-ldots+58-59) mod 60).    - This can be written as:      [      a_i = left(0 + sum_{j=1}^{i} (-1)^{j+1}j right) mod 60 quad text{for} quad i=0,1,ldots,59      ]    - Where (a_i) denotes the seat number of the (i)-th participant. 3. **Arranging the participants for subsequent days**:    - For the ((k+1))-th day, participants should be arranged differently so that everyone has a new neighbor to the right.    - For the ((k+1))-th day, the sequence can be computed as:      [      a^{(k+1)}_i = left(k + sum_{j=1}^{i} (-1)^{j+1}j right) mod 60      ]    - This ensures that each participant sits in a new place every day without repeating neighbors. 4. **Ensuring new neighbors**:    - By shifting the starting index (k) each day, we ensure that the sequence changes, guaranteeing different neighbors each day. For example, for the second day ((k=1)):    - Calculate the seating arrangement as:      [      a^{(1)}_i = left(1 + sum_{j=1}^{i} (-1)^{j+1}j right) mod 60      ] By following the steps indicated above for each day, the problem requires each participant to have a unique neighbor to the right every day for 15 days. The exact calculations for each (a^{(k)}_i) must be performed to check the unique seating arrangements. # Conclusion: By following the proposed seating arrangement algorithm, we ensure that no participant sits in the same seat twice, and everyone has a different neighbor to the right each day.

Can he achieve this? Suggest your own way of constructing such a square. What is the minimum number of rectangles needed for this?","output":"1. Let's define the number of rectangles n which are used to form a square. 2. The area of a square formed by these rectangles can be expressed as:    [    S = 14 times 10 times n    ]    where S represents the area of the square.  3. If the side of the square comprises m sides of length 14 and k sides of length 10, then the length of the side of the square is:    [    14m + 10k    ] 4. Therefore, the area of the square can also be written as:    [    S = (14m + 10k)^2    ] 5. By equating the two expressions for the area of the square, we get:    [    14 times 10 times n = (14m + 10k)^2     ] 6. Simplify the equation:    [    140n = (14m + 10k)^2    ]    Dividing both sides by 2,    [    70n = left(7m + 5kright)^2    ] 7. Notice that the left side of the equation is divisible by 7. Hence the right side, left(7m + 5kright)^2, must also be divisible by 49. 8. So, 7m + 5k must be divisible by 7. This means that n must be able to make 70n divisible by 49 and also 5. Therefore, n must contain both of these factors. 9. Similarly, analyze divisibility by 10. Since 70n must also be divisible by 10, n must contain a factor of 5. 10. For the smallest possible n that meets both conditions:     - Needs to be a multiple of 5 times 7 = 35 11. Therefore, the smallest possible value for n is:     [     n = 35     ] 12.

To analyze the divisibility properties, let's look at the factorization of these numbers. 2. Note that among any set of seven consecutive integers, there must be at least one multiple of 5 and one multiple of 10. Therefore, the product of these numbers will include the factors (2 times 5 = 10). 3. As an example, let's consider the numbers from 96 to 102. In this range, two multiples of 5 and one multiple of 10 appear: 100 contains at least two zeros (each zero comes from a factor 10).         For instance:     [     96 cdot 97 cdot 98 cdot 99 cdot 100 cdot 101 cdot 102     ]     The presence of 100, which can be factored as (2^2 times 5^2), indicates there are at least two zeros in its product. 4.

A factor of 10 consists of a factor of 2 and a factor of 5. Thus, we need to determine the highest power of 5 in this product because there are more factors of 2 than of 5.     Count each multiple of 5:     [     leftlfloor frac{57}{5} rightrfloor = 11      ]     (since (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 ,55))      3. Also count powers of (5^2):     [     leftlfloor frac{57}{25} rightrfloor = 2     ]     (since (25, 50)) 4. So, the total count of factors of 5 in 57 factorial is:     [     11 + 2 = 13     ] 5.

Here, three-point shots are worth 3 points, two-point shots are worth 2 points, and free throws are worth 1 point. Including the success rates: - 0.75x from three-point shots - 0.8y from two-point shots - 0.5z from free throws Substituting x + y = 30 and z = 10, we simplify the score calculation: [ 0.75x + 0.8y + 0.5 times 10 = 0.75x + 0.8y + 5 ] Since x + y = 30: [ 0.75x + 0.8(30 - x) + 5 = 0.75x + 24 - 0.8x + 5 ] [ -0.05x + 29 = 0 ] [ x = 580 ] However, x being 580 conflicts with our earlier statement x + y = 30.

First, we need to find the percentage of people who have the job of their choice and also have a university diploma. Since 10% of people have the job of their choice without a university diploma, the remaining 30% (40% - 10%) of people with the job of their choice must have a university diploma. Now, let's find the percentage of people who do not have the job of their choice. This is the complement of the 40% who have the job of their choice, which is 100% - 40% = 60%. Next, we need to find the percentage of people who have a university diploma but do not have the job of their choice. We know that 48% of people have a university diploma, and we've already accounted for 30% of those as having the job of their choice. Therefore, 48% - 30% = 18% of people have a university diploma but do not have the job of their choice. Finally, to find the percentage of people who do not have the job of their choice and have a university diploma, we take the 18% (who have a diploma but not the job of their choice) and divide it by the total percentage of people who do not have the job of their choice, which is 60%.

We aim to prove that the sum of the numbers in the right column, corresponding to the odd numbers in the left column, equals the product ab.  Step 1: Binary Representation of a Consider the binary representation of a: [ a = overline{alpha_{n} ldots alpha_{0}} ] Let the positions where the binary digit (bit) alpha_i is 1 be denoted by: [ i_1, i_2, ldots, i_s ] Thus, we can express a as: [ a = sum_{i=0}^{n} alpha_i cdot 2^i = sum_{t=1}^{s} 2^{i_t} ]  Step 2: Analyzing the Transformation Process 1. For any integer a, derive a_1:     - If a is even, a_1 = frac{a}{2}.     - If a is odd, a_1 = frac{a - 1}{2}. 2. Write 2b to the right of a_1. 3. Repeat the process for a_1:     - If a_1 is even, compute a_2 = frac{a_1}{2}.     - If a_1 is odd, compute a_2 = frac{a_1 - 1}{2}. 4. Continue this process until the left column contains the number 1.  Step 3: Identifying Odd Numbers in Binary Representation Note that a_i is odd if and only if there is a digit 1 in the binary representation of a on the corresponding position. Thus, we see a_i is odd exactly in those cases where 2^{i_t} is present in the sum representing a. When a_i is odd, the corresponding number to its right in the row is: [ 2^j cdot b ]  Step 4: Sum of Right Column Values We need to sum all values in the right column that correspond to odd numbers in the left column. The sum is: [ sum_{t = 1}^{s} b cdot 2^{i_t} ] Using the fact that: [ a = sum_{t = 1}^{s} 2^{i_t} ] we have: [ sum_{t = 1}^{s} b cdot 2^{i_t} = b cdot sum_{t = 1}^{s} 2^{i_t} = b cdot a ]  Conclusion: Hence, we have shown that the sum of the numbers in the right column, corresponding to the odd numbers in the left column, is: [ sum_{t=1}^{s} b cdot 2^{i_t} = ab ] Thus, the given process provides a method to calculate ab: [ boxed{ab} ]"},{"instruction":"The equation of the line that passes through the points (3, 1) and (1, 5) can be expressed in the form y = mx + b.

How many years less than normal did he spend in high school?","output":"Let's denote the number of years less than normal that Tate spent in high school as x.  Since he finishes high school in some years less than normal, the time he actually spent in high school is the normal duration minus x years. It then takes him 3 times that long (3x) to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D. The total time spent in high school and getting his degrees is the sum of the time spent in high school and the time spent on his bachelor's degree and Ph.D., which is given as 12 years. So we can write the equation: (Normal duration of high school - x) + 3x = 12 If we assume the normal duration of high school is 4 years (which is typical in many countries), the equation becomes: (4 - x) + 3x = 12 Combining like terms, we get: 4 - x + 3x = 12 4 + 2x = 12 Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get: 2x = 12 - 4 2x = 8 Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 8 / 2 x = 4 So, Tate spent boxed{4}  years less than normal in high school."},{"instruction":"the diagram, ( AB ) and ( AC ) have equal lengths.

Let's denote the vertices of the orthogonal parallelepiped as ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H ) such that ( A, B, C, D ) form one face, ( E, F, G, H ) form the opposite face, and the edges ( AE, BF, CG, DH ) are perpendicular to the faces ( ABCD ) and ( EFGH ). 2. **Partitioning the Parallelepiped**:    We need to show that this orthogonal parallelepiped can be partitioned into six right-faced tetrahedra. Consider the following tetrahedra:    - Tetrahedron 1: ( A, B, C, F )    - Tetrahedron 2: ( A, C, D, F )    - Tetrahedron 3: ( A, D, H, F )    - Tetrahedron 4: ( A, E, H, F )    - Tetrahedron 5: ( C, D, H, F )    - Tetrahedron 6: ( C, G, H, F ) 3. **Verifying Right-Faced Property**:    Each of these tetrahedra has faces that are right-angled triangles.

This means each face is a right-angled triangle. Let the vertices be ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 ). We need to find ( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 ) such that the edge lengths satisfy the given condition.    - Consider the face ( A_1A_2A_3 ). Since it is a right-angled triangle, we can assume without loss of generality that ( A_1A_2 ) and ( A_1A_3 ) are the legs, and ( A_2A_3 ) is the hypotenuse. Let ( c_1, c_2, c_3 ) be such that:      [      A_1A_2 = sqrt{|c_1 - c_2|}, quad A_1A_3 = sqrt{|c_1 - c_3|}, quad A_2A_3 = sqrt{|c_2 - c_3|}      ]    - Similarly, for the other faces, we can find ( c_4 ) such that the edge lengths involving ( A_4 ) also satisfy the given condition. 3. **Sufficiency (Only If Part)**:    Assume there exist four distinct real numbers ( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 ) such that the edge lengths are given by ( A_jA_k = sqrt{|c_j - c_k|} ). We need to show that the tetrahedron is right-faced.    - Consider the face ( A_1A_2A_3 ). The edge lengths are:      [      A_1A_2 = sqrt{|c_1 - c_2|}, quad A_1A_3 = sqrt{|c_1 - c_3|}, quad A_2A_3 = sqrt{|c_2 - c_3|}      ]    - Since ( c_1, c_2, c_3 ) are distinct, the triangle ( A_1A_2A_3 ) is a right-angled triangle.    - Similarly, for the other faces, the edge lengths involving ( c_4 ) will ensure that the faces are right-angled triangles. 4. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, a tetrahedron with vertices ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 ) is right-faced if and only if there exist four distinct real numbers ( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 ) such that the edges ( A_jA_k ) have lengths ( A_jA_k = sqrt{|c_j - c_k|} ) for ( 1 leq j < k leq 4 ).

Can the number of people be 65?","output":"To determine if the number of people in the meeting can be 65, we need to analyze the given conditions and use graph theory concepts. Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. **Graph Representation**:    - Represent the people in the meeting as vertices of a graph ( G ).    - An edge between two vertices indicates that the corresponding people know each other.    - Each person (vertex) does not know at least 56 others, implying that each vertex has a degree of at most ( 64 - 56 = 8 ). 2. **Triangle-Free Condition**:    - For any pair of vertices, there exists a third vertex that knows both of them. This implies that the graph is triangle-free (no three vertices form a triangle). 3. **Counting Closed Walks of Length 7**:    - We need to count the number of closed walks of length 7, denoted as ( f(7) ).    - A closed walk of length 7 is a sequence of vertices ( v_0, v_1, v_2, ldots, v_7 ) where ( v_i ) and ( v_{i+1} ) are connected and ( v_0 = v_7 ). 4. **Divisibility by 7**:    - If ( v_0, v_1, v_2, ldots, v_0 ) is a closed walk of length 7, then so are ( v_1, v_2, v_3, ldots, v_1 ), ( v_2, v_3, v_4, ldots, v_2 ), and so on.    - Therefore, ( f(7) ) is divisible by 7. 5. **Counting Closed Walks with a Fixed Vertex ( v_0 )**:    - Fix a vertex ( v_0 ) and count the number of closed walks ( v_0, v_1, v_2, ldots, v_0 ).    - If ( v_5 = v_0 ), the number of such walks is ( 8f(5) ).    - If ( v_5 neq v_0 ), the number of such walks is ( 8^5 - f(5) - X ), where ( X ) is the number of times ( v_5 ) and ( v_0 ) are connected. 6. **Finding ( X )**:    - If ( v_5 ) is connected to ( v_0 ), then ( v_4 ) is not a neighbor of ( v_0 ) (to avoid forming a triangle).    - Let ( Y ) be the number of walks where ( v_4 ) is connected to ( v_0 ), and ( Z ) be the number of walks where ( v_4 ) is not connected to ( v_0 ).    - ( Z = 8^4 - Y ).    - ( Y = 8 times 7^2 ) because from ( v_0 ) we have 8 possibilities for ( v_1 ), 7 possibilities for ( v_2 ) (excluding ( v_0 )), 7 possibilities for ( v_3 ), and a unique vertex connected to both ( v_0 ) and ( v_3 ).    - Therefore, ( Z = 8^4 - 8 times 7^2 ). 7. **Finding ( T )**:    - ( T ) is the number of walks where ( v_4 = v_0 ).    - ( T = 8 times 15 ). 8. **Combining Results**:    - ( X = Z + T = 8^4 - 8 times 7^2 + 8 times 15 ).    - ( f(7) = 8f(5) + 8^5 - f(5) - X = 7f(5) + 8^5 - (8^4 - 8 times 7^2 + 8 times 15) equiv -1 pmod{7} ). 9. **Summing Over All Vertices**:    - Summing over all vertices, we get ( -65 equiv 0 pmod{7} ), which is a contradiction.

This is also a power of (2) higher than (3), thus making it divisible by (8).    Therefore, the sum (2^{5^{2^{5^{*}}}} + 4^{5^{4^{5^{*}}}}) is divisible by (8). 2. **Divisibility by (251)**:    Notice that we have the numbers (2) and (4) raised to very large powers. We will use properties of modular arithmetic.        - First, observe that (2^8 = 256 equiv 5 pmod{251}).    - Consequently, (2^{25} equiv 2 cdot (2^8)^3 equiv 2 cdot 5^3 = 2 cdot 125 = 250 equiv -1 pmod{251}).    Consider the exponents in our problem:    - For (2^{5^{2^{5^{*}}}}), suppose the exponent (5^{2^{5^{*}}} = k). Then, (k) is an odd multiple of (25) (since (2^{x}) is always even, raising (5^{even}) is still a power of (5)), i.e., (k = 25u) where (u) is odd. Therefore,      [      2^{25u} equiv (2^{25})^u equiv (-1)^u pmod{251}.      ]    - For (4^{5^{4^{5^{*}}}}), let the exponent (5^{4^{5^{*}}} = m). This is again a multiple of (25), i.e., (m = 25v). Thus,      [      4^{25v} = (2^2)^{25v} = 2^{50v} equiv (2^{50})^v.      ]      Notice that (2^{50} = (2^{25})^2 equiv (-1)^2 = 1 pmod{251}). Hence,      [      4^{25v} equiv 1^v = 1 pmod{251}.      ]    Summing these two results yields:    [    (-1)^u + 1^v = 0 pmod{251}    ]    since (u) is odd, ((-1)^u = -1), and adding (1) gives zero. Conclusion: The sum (2^{5^{2^{5^{*}}}} + 4^{5^{4^{5^{*}}}}) is divisible by both (8) and (251). Given that  (2008 = 8 cdot 251), we can conclude that: [ 2^{5^{2^{5^{*}}}} + 4^{5^{4^{5^{*}}}} equiv 0 pmod{2008} ] Therefore, the statement is proved.

Our goal is to remove some digits (but not all) so that the resulting number is a multiple of 5. For a number to be a multiple of 5, its last digit must be either 0 or 5. Since 0 is not present in the number, we must retain the digit 5 at the end. 1. **Identify digits that must be removed:**    - The digits 6, 7, and 8 must be removed because they cannot be at the end if the number has to be a multiple of 5. If any of these digits were at the end, the number would not be a multiple of 5. 2. **Digits before 5:**    - Each digit before the 5 can either be included in the sequence or removed, still ensuring the last digit remains 5. 3. **Possible combinations:**    - For the digits 2 and 3, each can either be included or removed independently. This gives us 2^2 = 4 combinations (each digit has 2 choices: include or remove).     4. **Digit 4:**    - There are two 4s, and we can choose to:      - Include neither      - Include the first one and remove the second      - Include the second one and remove the first      - Include both        This leads to 3 choices (0, 1, or 2 inclusions). 5. **Digit 1:**    - There are four 1s, and we can choose to:      - Include zero 1s      - Include one 1      - Include two 1s      - Include three 1s      - Include all four 1s     This gives us 5 choices (from 0 to 4 inclusions). 6. **Calculate total possibilities:**    - The choices for 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are independent of each other.

Examining these within the viable range:     - **( x ) divisible by (7 ):** If (x-1) must be divisible by (11 cdot 13 = 143), (x gt 100).     - **( x ) divisible by (11):** (x-1) must be divisible by (91).

We need to find the values of b that satisfy this inequality. 1. **Finding the lower bound**:    [ b^2 leq 256 ]    Taking the square root on both sides:    [ b leq sqrt{256} = 16 ] 2. **Finding the upper bound**:    [ 256 < b^3 ]    Taking the cube root on both sides:    [ sqrt[3]{256} approx 6.3496 ]    Therefore, b > 6.3496, and since b must be an integer, b geq 7. 3. **Determining valid b values**:    Combining these bounds, we have:    [ 7 leq b leq 16 ]    The integers from 7 to 16 inclusive are counted as follows: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

A certain event is one that will definitely occur and hence has a probability of 1, while an impossible event is one that will definitely not occur and thus has a probability of 0. - For option A, we know the probability of any event can indeed fall between 0 and 1, but this does not mean it is neither a certain event nor an impossible event. Hence, statement A is not necessarily correct as it eliminates the possibility of the event being certain (probability of 1) or impossible (probability of 0). - Regarding option B, it suggests that if P(A) = 0.999, then A must occur. However, even though the probability is very high, it's still not equal to 1, which is the actual probability of a certain event. - Option C states that if 99% of the light bulbs are qualified, then the probability of picking a qualified bulb is 99%. This is based on the qualification rate provided and assumes random selection, which aligns with the probability definition. - Finally, for option D, if P(A) = 0.001, this signifies that event A is highly unlikely, yet as long as the probability is greater than 0, the event is not considered impossible.

This implies several things about the coefficients a, b, and c. 1. **Determine the Sign of a**:    For the quadratic to be positive between x = -1 and x = 2 and negative outside this interval, the parabola must open downwards, implying a < 0.    Therefore, option B is correct: a < 0. 2. **Relation between a, b, and c**:    The roots of the equation ax^2 - bx + c = 0 are related to the solution set (-1, 2) by Vieta's formulas. The sum of the roots is given by -b/a = (-1) + 2 = 1 and the product of the roots is c/a = (-1) times 2 = -2.    Solving these equations for b and c in terms of a gives:    - 1 = frac{b}{a} implies b = a    - -2 = frac{c}{a} implies c = -2a 3. **Checking the Options**:    - **Option A**: a + b + c = a + a - 2a = 0. Therefore, option A is correct.    - **Option C**: Given b = a and c = -2a with a < 0, it implies b < 0 and c > 0, contradicting option C.    - **Option D**: For the inequality ax^{2} + cx + b > 0 which simplifies to ax^{2} - 2ax + a > 0 or (x-1)^{2} > 0, this statement is incorrect because (x-1)^{2} geq 0 for all x in R, but cannot be strictly greater than 0 for every real number since it equals 0 when x = 1.

We are required to determine the minimum percentage of participants who solved all four problems. Let's approach this problem step-by-step: 1. **Calculate the Complementary Percentages**:    The complementary percentage provides the percentage of participants who did not solve each problem:    - Percentage who did not solve the first problem: ( 100% - 85% = 15% )    - Percentage who did not solve the second problem: ( 100% - 80% = 20% )    - Percentage who did not solve the third problem: ( 100% - 75% = 25% )    - Percentage who did not solve the fourth problem: ( 100% - 70% = 30% ) 2. **Sum of Non-Solving Percentages**:    To find the maximum possible percentage of participants who did not solve at least one problem, we sum the complementary percentages:    [    15% + 20% + 25% + 30% = 90%    ] 3. **Maximum Percentage of Participants Who Did Not Solve All Problems**:    The calculated sum above implies that up to 90% of participants may have failed to solve at least one problem. Consequently, the minimum percentage of participants who solved all problems is:    [    100% - 90% = 10%    ] 4. **Verification**:    We should verify if it is feasible that only 10% of the participants solved all four problems. If 10% solved all problems, it implies that 90% did not solve one or more problems. For this scenario to be possible, no participant should fail at more than one problem. Here is a possible distribution example for 100 participants:    - 30 participants solved the first three problems but not the fourth.    - 25 participants solved the first, second, and fourth problems, but not the third.    - 20 participants solved the first, third, and fourth problems, but not the second.    - 15 participants solved the second, third, and fourth problems, but not the first.    - 10 participants solved all four problems.    Adding these:    [    30 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 100    ]    This configuration complies with the problem statement and supports that exactly 10% of participants solved all four problems. **Conclusion**: At least 10% of participants solved all four problems.

For a number ( n ), ( p(n) ) is defined as the product of its non-zero digits. 2. **Breaking Down the Problem:**    We can consider the numbers from 1 to 999 as three-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros if necessary. For example, 5 can be considered as 005. 3. **Calculating ( p(n) ) for Each Digit:**    - For a single-digit number ( n ), ( p(n) = n ).    - For a two-digit number ( n = 10a + b ), ( p(n) = a cdot b ) if ( a neq 0 ) and ( b neq 0 ).    - For a three-digit number ( n = 100a + 10b + c ), ( p(n) = a cdot b cdot c ) if ( a, b, c neq 0 ). 4. **Summing ( p(n) ) for All Numbers from 1 to 999:**    We need to consider the contribution of each digit position (hundreds, tens, and units) separately. 5. **Contribution of Each Digit Position:**    - Each digit from 1 to 9 appears in each position (hundreds, tens, units) exactly 100 times in the range from 1 to 999.    - The sum of the non-zero digits from 1 to 9 is ( 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 9 = 45 ). 6. **Calculating the Total Sum:**    - For each digit position, the sum of the products of the non-zero digits is ( 45 ) (since each digit from 1 to 9 appears 100 times).    - Therefore, the total sum for each position is ( 45 times 100 = 4500 ). 7. **Combining the Contributions:**    - Since there are three positions (hundreds, tens, units), the total sum ( S ) is ( 4500 + 4500 + 4500 = 13500 ). 8. **Correcting the Calculation:**    - We need to consider the product of the non-zero digits for each number. For example, for 105, ( p(105) = 1 times 5 = 5 ).    - The correct approach is to consider the product of the sums of the non-zero digits for each position. 9. **Revisiting the Calculation:**    - The sum of the products of the non-zero digits for each position is ( (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 9) = 46 ).    - Therefore, the total sum ( S ) is ( 46^3 ). 10. **Final Calculation:**     [     S = 46^3 = 46 times 46 times 46 = 97336     ] 11. **Finding the Largest Prime Factor:**     - We need to find the prime factors of 97336.     - The prime factorization of 97336 is ( 2^3 times 11567 ).     - The largest prime factor is 11567.

The next largest power of 3 is 3^4 = 81, subtracting this gives 102 - 81 = 21. Then, 3^3 = 27 is greater than 21, so we move to 3^2 = 9, and 21 - 9 = 12. Another 3^2 = 9 fits into 12, so 12 - 9 = 3.

Each pump has a rate at which it fills the tank, and we can add these rates together to find the combined rate when all three pumps are working together. Let's define the rates of the pumps as follows: - The small pump fills the tank in 4 hours, so its rate is 1/4 of the tank per hour. - The larger pump fills the tank in 0.5 hours (half an hour), so its rate is 1/0.5 or 2 tanks per hour. - The medium-sized pump fills the tank in 2 hours, so its rate is 1/2 of the tank per hour. Now, let's add these rates together to find the combined rate: Combined rate = (1/4) + 2 + (1/2) = (1/4) + (4/2) + (1/2) = (1/4) + 2 + (1/2) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The smallest common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4.

Substituting alphabeta = 3-k into this equation: [ k^{2} = (3-k) + 3k = 3 + 2k ] Rearranging and solving the quadratic equation: [ k^{2} - 2k - 3 = 0 implies (k-3)(k+1) = 0 ] Thus, we find k_{1} = 3 and k_{2} = -1.

The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of x and y in that term. Since the polynomial is a sixth-degree quadrinomial, each term must contribute to this degree. Similarly, the monomial frac{3}{2}pi x^2y^{5-n} must also be of the sixth degree to match the polynomial's degree. Therefore, we set up the following system of equations based on the degrees: For the polynomial: - The term -8x^{3}y^{m} has a degree of 3 + m. - The term xy^{2} has a degree of 1 + 2 = 3. - The term -3x^{3} has a degree of 3. - The term 6y has a degree of 1. For the monomial: - The term frac{3}{2}pi x^2y^{5-n} has a degree of 2 + (5-n). Given that the polynomial is of the sixth degree, we have: [ begin{align*} 3 + m &= 6, 2 + (5-n) &= 6. end{align*} ] Solving these equations, we find: [ begin{align*} m &= 6 - 3 = 3, 5 - n &= 6 - 2 = 4 Rightarrow n = 5 - 4 = 1. end{align*} ] Therefore, the values of m and n are m = 3 and n = 1, respectively. So, we have: [ boxed{m = 3, n = 1} ] **(2)** To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial, we simply add the coefficients of each term in the polynomial. The coefficients are -8 (from -8x^{3}y^{m}), 1 (from xy^{2}), -3 (from -3x^{3}), and 6 (from 6y). Adding these together, we get: [ -8 + 1 - 3 + 6 = -4. ] Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial is -4.

To solve the problem, we need to ensure that when the cube is placed inside the box, each painted face of the cube is adjacent to a face of the box painted in a different color.  4.

Choosing the center maximizes the distances to the borders of the interval and limits the immediate viable choices for Nora.  Step 2: Consider Nora's response Nora then needs to choose a number at least two units away from (x=frac{n}{2}).

Any twodigit number formed by consecutive digits within this string is divisible by 19 or 31. What is the largest possible last digit in this string?","output":"To solve this problem, we first list all the two-digit multiples of 19 and 31 that are relevant to our constraints. These multiples are: - Multiples of 19: 19, 38, 57, 76, 95 - Multiples of 31: 31, 62, 93 Combining these, we have the two-digit numbers: 19, 31, 38, 57, 62, 76, 93, and 95. If we attempt to build the string from the beginning, starting with 1, we encounter multiple paths for the subsequent digits. For example, if the second digit is 9 (from the number 19), the third digit could be either 3 or 5, leading to different possibilities. However, a crucial observation is that no units digit in our list appears more than once. This uniqueness implies that if we construct the string in reverse, the sequence of digits is uniquely determined. Let's consider the largest possible last digit. If we want the 2002nd digit to be 9, then the preceding digits must follow a specific sequence to maintain the divisibility rule. Specifically, the sequence would be: 2002nd digit is 9, 2001st digit is 1, 2000th digit is 3, 1999th digit is 9, and so on. This pattern would eventually lead to the first digit being 9, which contradicts our initial condition that the first digit is 1. Therefore, the last digit cannot be 9. Next, we consider the next largest possible digit, which is 8. If the 2002nd digit is 8, then the sequence of preceding digits is uniquely determined as follows: - The 2002nd digit is 8 - The 2001st digit is 3 (from 38) - The 2000th digit is 9 (from 93) - The 1999th digit is 1 (from 19) - The 1998th digit is 3 (from 31), and so on. This pattern allows the first digit to be 1, satisfying our initial condition.

This setup might yield exactly 8 intersection points through a specific combination of chosen lines.          - **Mathematical Consistency:**                  The number of intersection points ( P ) can only be achieved according to the combination principle, that each new intersecting pair of lines adds a unique intersection if it wasn't previously counted:         [         P = binom{n}{2} - k = 21 - k         ]                  For our requirement ( P leq 21 ). Hence, this results in:         [         k = 21 - P         ]                  Thus for ( P = 8 ),          [         k = 21 - 8 = 13         ]                  This scenario implies that intersections can be reduced by selectively managing lines avoiding 13 intersections. # Conclusion: The points of intersection with 7 lines ( {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, ldots, 21} ) are: [ boxed{0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ldots, 21} ] Numbers from 2 to 5 are not feasible since more complex manipulations are required for exact point pairs."},{"instruction":"Select 4 athletes from 6 to participate in a 4x100m relay race, where athlete A cannot run the first leg, and athlete B cannot run the fourth leg.

The player who takes the last stones wins. How should one play to win?","output":"The problem involves a game between two players with a pile of 100 stones. Players take turns to take 1, 2, 3, or 5 stones from the pile. The winner is the player who takes the last stone(s). The task is to determine the winning strategy. The game relies on creating positions that are advantageous (i.e., winnable) and disadvantageous (i.e., not winnable) for each player. A key strategic observation is that the second player can ensure a win by maintaining the pile at a number of stones that is a multiple of 4 after each of their moves. Here’s a detailed step-by-step solution to the problem: 1. **Objective of the Second Player:**     The second player aims to always leave a multiple of 4 stones in the pile after their turn. This is because if the first player faces a multiple of 4 stones, no matter how many stones they take (1, 2, 3, or 5), the second player can always take enough stones to return the pile to a multiple of 4.  2. **Initial Move Analysis:**    - When starting with 100 stones (not a multiple of 4), the first player's move can be analyzed based on the number they choose to take:      - If the first player takes 1 stone: (100 - 1 = 99) stones remain.      - If the first player takes 2 stones: (100 - 2 = 98) stones remain.      - If the first player takes 3 stones: (100 - 3 = 97) stones remain.      - If the first player takes 5 stones: (100 - 5 = 95) stones remain. 3. **Second Player Strategy:**    The second player then makes the following moves:    - If 99 stones remain (after the first player took 1 stone), the second player should take 3 stones: (99 - 3 = 96) stones (a multiple of 4).    - If 98 stones remain (after the first player took 2 stones), the second player should take 2 stones: (98 - 2 = 96) stones (a multiple of 4).    - If 97 stones remain (after the first player took 3 stones), the second player should take 1 stone: (97 - 1 = 96) stones (a multiple of 4).    - If 95 stones remain (after the first player took 5 stones), the second player should take 3 stones: (95 - 3 = 92) stones (a multiple of 4). 4. **Inductive Step:**    By maintaining this strategy, no matter the remaining multiple of 4 after the second player’s turn, the first player’s turn will again result in a non-multiple of 4, and the second player will always follow the pattern to bring it back to the next multiple of 4. This scenario forces the first player into never being able to pick the last stone(s). 5. **Final Position:**    The final sequence falls into a pattern where ranges like (4, 8, 12, ...) will eventually reduce to the last critical moves such as (1, 2, 3, 5) before the last stone, ensuring the second player always finishing the game successfully by taking the last stone when the multiple of 4 have been exhausted to zero. Therefore, the second player wins by always making the pile reduced to a multiple of 4 stones after every move. # Conclusion Based on this strategy and logical conclusions, the second player has a guaranteed winning strategy if they play optimally.

The vertical shift moves the graph up by 1 unit, changing the y-coordinates from y = f(x) to y = f(x) + 1. Working on these transformations: 1. Horizontal shift (right by 2 units): Move each point of the graph (x, f(x)) to (x + 2, f(x)). 2. Vertical shift (up by 1 unit): Move each now horizontally-shifted point (x+2, f(x)) to (x+2, f(x)+1).

Since we don't have a 0 in our set of digits, the number must end in 5 to be divisible by 5. For a number to be divisible by 4, the last two digits of the number must form a number that is divisible by 4. Since our number must end in 5 to be divisible by 5, we need to find a digit from the remaining set {2, 4, 6, 8} that can pair with 5 to form a number divisible by 4. The only possibility is 2 because 52 is divisible by 4. So, the number must end in 25 to be divisible by both 4 and 5. Now, we have three remaining digits to form the first three digits of the number: 4, 6, and 8. These can be arranged in any order, so there are 3!

For Group A, which consists of the numbers 1 to 9, the median is the middle number, which is 5. For Group B, which includes numbers 1 to 10, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, 5 and 6, which is frac{5+6}{2} = 5.5. Therefore, proposition ① correctly identifies the medians of Group A and Group B as 5 and 5.5, respectively. **Proposition ②**: The correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A value of r=-0.88 indicates a strong negative correlation, not a weak correlation. The common interpretation is that |r| geqslant 0.75 represents a strong correlation. Thus, proposition ② is incorrect because it misinterprets the strength of the correlation. **Proposition ③**: The observed value of chi^{2} from the data is 4.567. According to the attachment, for a probability of making an incorrect inference not exceeding 0.05, the critical value k_{0.05} = 3.841. Since 4.567 > 3.841, it indicates that the two variables are related with the specified probability of error. Therefore, proposition ③ is correct in its interpretation of the chi^{2} test result. **Proposition ④**: In regression analysis, after obtaining the regression line equation hat{y}=hat{b}x+hat{a}, residual analysis involves calculating the difference between the observed values and the values predicted by the regression line. The formula given for the residual, hat{e}_{i} = y_{i} - (hat{b}x_{i} + hat{a}), is correct. This means proposition ④ accurately describes the process of residual analysis. **Conclusion**: The incorrect proposition is ② because it incorrectly characterizes the correlation strength based on the value of r.

Solving this equation gives us:    [    k^{2}-1=0 implies k^{2}=1 implies k=pm1.    ]    However, for it to be in one variable, the coefficient of x must also be zero when k^{2}-1=0.

We need to find the sides and angles of the triangle. 1. Let the sides of the triangle be denoted as (a, a+1, a+2), where (a) is the smallest side. 2. Denote the angles opposite these sides as (alpha, beta, 2alpha), respectively.  3. According to the sine rule (Law of Sines), we have: [ frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{a+2}{sin 2alpha} ] 4. Using the double-angle identity, (sin 2alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha), we can rewrite the equation as: [ frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{a+2}{2 sin alpha cos alpha} ] 5. Simplifying the equation, we get: [ a = frac{a+2}{2 cos alpha} ] 6. This implies: [ 2a cos alpha = a+2 ] [ cos alpha = frac{a+2}{2a} ] 7. Using the Law of Cosines, we express (cos alpha) in terms of the sides of the triangle:     [ a^2 = (a+1)^2 + (a+2)^2 - 2(a+1)(a+2) cos alpha ] 8. Simplifying, we get: [ a^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1 + a^2 + 4a + 4 -2(a^2 + 3a + 2) cos alpha ] 9. Cancelling common terms and rearranging: [ 0 = 6a + 5 - 2(a^2 + 3a + 2) cos alpha ] [ 2(a^2 + 3a + 2) cos alpha = 6a + 5 ] 10. Dividing by 2: [ (a^2 + 3a + 2) cos alpha = 3a + frac{5}{2} ] 11. Substitute (cos alpha = frac{a + 2}{2a}): [ (a^2 + 3a + 2) frac{a+2}{2a} = 3a + frac{5}{2} ] 12. Multiplying both sides by (2a): [ (a^2 + 3a + 2)(a+2) = (6a^2 + 5a) ] 13. Expanding the left side: [ a^3 + 2a^2 + 3a^2 + 6a + 2a + 4 = 6a^2 + 5a ] 14. Simplifying: [ a^3 + 5a^2 + 8a + 4 = 6a^2 + 5a ] [ a^3 - a^2 + 3a + 4 = 0 ] 15. Solving this polynomial equation, we find that (a = 4). 16. Therefore, the sides of the triangle are: [ 4, 5, 6 ] 17. Now, calculate the angles of the triangle by using (cos alpha): [ cos alpha = frac{4 + 2}{2 cdot 4} = frac{6}{8} = frac{3}{4} ] 18. Calculating the angle using the inverse cosine function: [ alpha = cos^{-1} left( frac{3}{4} right) approx 41^circ 24' 35'' ] 19. The largest angle, being twice the smallest angle: [ 2alpha approx 82^circ 49' 10'' ] 20.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 1. **Understanding Knights and Liars:**     - Knights always tell the truth.    - Liars always lie. 2. **Statement Analysis:**    - (A) says, \\"Either I am a liar or two plus two equals five.\\"    - Let (P) represent the statement \\"I am a liar.\\"    - Let (Q) represent the statement \\"Two plus two equals five.\\" 3. **Logical Representation:**    - The statement by (A) can be represented as (P lor Q) (where (lor) denotes the logical OR). 4. **Evaluate (Q):**    - (Q) (\\"Two plus two equals five\\") is false. 5. **Case Assumptions:**     - Let's assume (A) is a knight:         - As a knight, (A) tells the truth, so the statement (P lor Q) must be true.         - Since (Q) is false, (P) must be true for (P lor Q) to be true.         - If (P) is true, it means that (A) is a liar. This leads to a contradiction because a knight cannot be a liar.     - Let's assume (A) is a liar:         - As a liar, (A) lies, so the statement (P lor Q) must be false.         - We already know (Q) is false.         - Since both (Q) is false and the entire statement (P lor Q) is false, (P) must also be false to keep (P lor Q) false.         - If (P) is false, it means (A) is not a liar. This, too, leads to a contradiction because a liar cannot tell the truth. 6. **Conclusion:**     - The statement given by (A) creates a logical paradox.     - Because we encounter contradictions when assuming either (A) is a knight or (A) is a liar, this indicates the conditions in the problem are self-contradictory.     - Therefore, a logical conclusion is that the author of this problem made an error or intentionally provided a paradox.

The product of the number of stones in these two piles is recorded on a blackboard. 1. **Definition of Capacity:**    The capacity of a pile with (m) stones is defined as:    [    C(m) = frac{m(m-1)}{2}    ]     2. **Capacity Calculation for Two Piles:**    When a pile of (a + b) stones is split into two piles with (a) stones and (b) stones respectively, the total capacity before the split is:    [    C(a+b) = frac{(a+b)(a+b-1)}{2}    ] 3. **Capacity Conservation:**    After the split, the total capacity of the system includes the capacities of the two piles and the product recorded on the blackboard:    [    C(a+b) = C(a) + C(b) + ab    ]    which explicitly is:    [    frac{(a+b)(a+b-1)}{2} = frac{a(a-1)}{2} + frac{b(b-1)}{2} + ab    ] 4. **Equivalence Before and After the Operation:**    This equation shows that the total \\"capacity\\" of the system remains unchanged through each operation, with the term (ab) (the product recorded on the blackboard) making up the difference. 5. **Final Distribution of Stones:**    As the operations continue until each pile is reduced to a single stone, the final capacity of each pile of one stone is:    [    C(1) = frac{1 cdot (1-1)}{2} = 0    ]    Therefore, the sum of the capacities of all individual piles with just one stone is zero. 6. **Initial and Final Capacities Relationship:**    Since the capacity is conserved and the final capacity of each stone is zero, the total sum on the blackboard must be equal to the initial capacity of the initial pile of 2019 stones. 7. **Initial Capacity Calculation:**    The initial capacity of the pile with 2019 stones is:    [    C(2019) = frac{2019 times 2018}{2} = frac{2019 cdot 2018}{2}    ] 8. **Final Answer:**    So, the total sum of the numbers written on the blackboard, which equals the initial capacity, is:    [    boxed{2037171}    ]"},{"instruction":"Simplify first, then find the value: x(sqrt{6}x)+ (x+sqrt{5})(xsqrt{5}), where x=sqrt{6}sqrt{2}.","output":"To simplify the given expression and then find its value for x=sqrt{6}-sqrt{2}, we proceed as follows: First, we simplify the given expression: begin{align*} x(sqrt{6}-x)+ (x+sqrt{5})(x-sqrt{5}) &= sqrt{6}x -

Denoting the slopes of PF_1 and PF_2 by k_{PF_1} and k_{PF_2} respectively, we have: k_{PF_1} cdot k_{PF_2} = -1. For PF_1, the slope can be written as: k_{PF_1} = frac{4}{3 + c}. For PF_2, the slope is: k_{PF_2} = frac{4}{3 - c}. Setting their product equal to -1, we have: frac{4}{3 + c} cdot frac{4}{3 - c} = -1.  Solving this equation yields c = 5. Since the distance between the foci (2c) and the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes (a and b) satisfy the equation a^2 - b^2 = c^2, we can write: a^2 - b^2 = 25.

Since b_2 = a_2 and T_4 = 1 + S_3, we have b_1 = 1 and d = 3 quad quad(8). Thus, the formula for {b_n} is b_n = 3n - 2 quad quad(9).

Let's denote the side lengths of the rectangular prism as a, b, and c. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the lengths of the external diagonals can be represented as sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, sqrt{b^2 + c^2}, and sqrt{a^2 + c^2}. Given this, we can square these expressions to avoid dealing with square roots, resulting in a^2 + b^2, b^2 + c^2, and a^2 + c^2. Since a, b, and c are all positive lengths (side lengths of a prism cannot be negative), we can infer that the sum of any two of these squared diagonal lengths must be greater than the square of the third diagonal length. This is because adding any positive quantity to a number will increase its value. For instance, if we take (a^2 + b^2) + (b^2 + c^2), this sum equals (a^2 + c^2) + 2b^2, which is strictly greater than a^2 + c^2 since 2b^2 > 0. To apply this logic to our problem, we need to check each set of external diagonal lengths given in the options to see if the sum of the squares of the two smaller numbers is greater than the square of the largest number. This will help us identify any set that could not represent the lengths of the external diagonals of a right regular prism. For option (B) {4,5,7}, we calculate the squares and sum as follows: - Squaring the numbers: 4^2 = 16, 5^2 = 25, 7^2 = 49. - Adding the squares of the two smaller numbers: 16 + 25 = 41. - Comparing this sum to the square of the largest number: 41 < 49. This comparison shows that the sum of the squares of the two smaller numbers (41) is not greater than the square of the largest number (49), which violates the condition derived from the Pythagorean theorem for the lengths of the external diagonals of a right regular prism.

All angles in the polygon are equal, and the side lengths are distinct positive integers. We need to prove that for any integer (k) with (1 leq k leq p), the sum of (k) consecutive side lengths is at least (frac{k^3 + k}{2}). 2. **Equiangular Condition:**    Let the side lengths be (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{pq-1}). The equiangular condition implies:    [    a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + cdots + a_{pq-1} x^{pq-1} = 0    ]    where (x = e^{2pi i / pq}) is a primitive (pq)-th root of unity. 3. **Array Representation:**    We can arrange the side lengths (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{pq-1}) in a (p times q) array.

Formally, for any rectangle with corners (a, b, c, d), we have:    [    a + c = b + d    ] 6. **Proof of the Main Claim:**    - We can increment or decrement every entry in a row or column by the same amount without changing the flatness of the array.    - This operation preserves the sum (a + c - b - d) for any rectangle.    - By performing these operations, we can make the first row and column all zeros.    - Since the number of zeros equals the nullity of the map, the entire array becomes zero, preserving the condition (a + c = b + d). 7. **Corollary:**    There exist integers (r_0, r_1, ldots, r_{p-1}) and (s_0, s_1, ldots, s_{q-1}) such that:    [    a_k = r_k + s_k    ]    for all (k), where indices are taken modulo (pq), (p), and (q) respectively. 8. **Summing (k) Consecutive Side Lengths:**    For (1 leq k leq p), consider the sum of (k) consecutive side lengths:    [    a_0 + a_1 + cdots + a_{k-1} = r_0 + r_1 + cdots + r_{k-1} + s_0 + s_1 + cdots + s_{k-1}    ]    The (k times k) subarray contains (k^2) distinct positive integers.

To make it easier to identify the vertex of the parabola (which gives us the maximum height in this context), we can complete the square: h=-5(t^{2}-3t).

For f(2) > 0, we need:  18 - 2a > 0 Rightarrow 9 - a > 0 Rightarrow a < 9.  However, since x is within the interval [1, 2], we must consider the entire interval. Thus, the condition that needs to be satisfied is the less restrictive one, which is a < 9. But from the options we derived, the relevant condition for the given interval is a < 4. Hence, the range for the real number a ensuring that there is an x satisfying the inequality within the given interval is (-infty, 4).

To prove the given inequality, we begin by establishing the following claim:  Claim: For any positive real numbers x and y such that xy geq 1, we have [ (x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1) leq left( left(frac{x + y}{2}right)^2 + 1 right)^2. ]  Proof of Claim: Given xy geq 1, we observe that (frac{x + y}{2})^2 - 1 geq xy - 1 geq 0. This implies: [ (frac{x + y}{2})^2 geq 1. ] We now expand and simplify the left-hand side of the inequality: [ (x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1) = x^2y^2 + x^2 + y^2 + 1. ] Next, consider the right-hand side of the inequality: [ left( left( frac{x + y}{2} right)^2 + 1 right)^2 = left( frac{x^2 + y^2 + 2xy}{4} + 1 right)^2 = left( frac{x^2 + y^2}{4} + frac{xy}{2} + 1 right)^2. ] Since xy geq 1: [ (xy - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2 leq left( (frac{x + y}{2})^2 + 1 right)^2. ] Thus, it follows that: [ (x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1) leq left( left( frac{x + y}{2} right)^2 + 1 right)^2. ] 2. Proceeding with the primary proof: Without loss of generality, assume a geq b geq c. This implies a geq 1. Let d = frac{a + b + c}{3}. We need to show: [ sqrt[3]{(a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)(c^2 + 1)} leq left( frac{a + b + c}{3} right)^2 + 1. ] We analyze: [ ad = frac{a(a + b + c)}{3} geq frac{1 + 1 + 1}{3} = 1 quad text {since } a, b, c geq 1. ] Using the claim to the pair (a, d) and (b, c): [ (a^2 + 1)(d^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)(c^2 + 1) leq left( left( frac{a + d}{2} right)^2 + 1 right)^2 left( left( frac{b + c}{2} right)^2 + 1 right)^2. ] Next, [ frac{a + d}{2} cdot frac{b + c}{2} geq sqrt{ad} cdot sqrt{bc} geq 1. ] Apply the claim again to left( frac{a + d}{2}, frac{b + c}{2} right): [ left( a^2 + 1 right) left( d^2 + 1 right) left( b^2 + 1 right) left( c^2 + 1 right) leq left( frac{a + b + c + d}{4} right)^2 + 1. ] Then: [ left( a^2 + 1 right) left( b^2 + 1 right) left( c^2 + 1right) leq left( left( frac{a + b + c + d}{4} right)^2 + 1 right)^4 = left( d^2 + 1 right)^3. ] Therefore: [ sqrt[3]{(a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)(c^2 + 1)} leq d^2 + 1. ] Since: [ d = frac{a + b + c}{3}, ] we have: [ sqrt[3]{(a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)(c^2 + 1)} leq left( frac{a + b + c}{3} right)^2 + 1. ] Thus, the final form is: [ boxed{ sqrt[3]{(a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)(c^2 + 1)} leq left( frac{a + b + c}{3} right)^2 + 1 } ]"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],N={key:0},W={key:1};function E(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(i(!0),a(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(i(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
