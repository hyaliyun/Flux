Other early settlers were delinquents who feared torture or death by the authorities.As the codfish boom unraveled the artisan fishermen of Puerto Gaviota and Puerto Gala came into conflict with industrial fishing. Overexploitation led eventually the government to put a ban on codfish fishing. The ban caused unemployment and the return to mainland Chile of some settlers.As of 2002 the village had a population of 117 inhabitants, 80 male and 37 female, by 2017 the population had declined to 65, 49 male and 16 female. == References ==","output":"{ \\"command\\": { \\"name\\": \\"message_user\\", \\"args\\": { \\"message\\": \\"Puerto Gaviota is a village with a history intricately linked to Chile's political and economic tides.

The zoo on the grounds of the Mundenhof is well-visited. The municipal garden center is also located on the grounds. The Mundenhof is one of many Green Spaces in Freiburg, which present a major factor in its reputation as a green city. == History == The earliest documented reference to the Mundenhof estate is from 12 September 864. This document was a deed of gift, in which the owner, a priest named Rumolt, bequeaths the Muntichova estate unto the Abbey of Saint Gall for agricultural use. From 1294 to 1806, the \\"Mundenhof\\" estate belonged to the monastery of Günterstal. The monastery was abolished as a result of secularization, and the Mundenhof was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Baden, which in turn sold it in 1808 to the University of Freiburg. In 1889, the city of Freiburg purchased a large part of the grounds for agricultural use. After that, the city also purchased a big area surrounding the Mundenhof to be used for the Freiburger Rieselfelder, a natural water purification plant, which was operated by people living in the Mundenhof. In 1920, this area had to be enlarged to 320 hectares. At that time it was one of the biggest farms in Baden-Württemberg. In its heyday, it had 400 cows that produced about 400,000 liters of milk. Additionally, pig breeding and crop production were another means of making a living on the Mundenhof. In 1985, the water purification plant was stopped, and the Mundenhof lost one source of revenue. This and price deterioration made the farm uneconomical, so in order to survive, it was changed into a model ecological farm. This farm covers the demands of all the straw and food for the animals in the enclosure. In 1991, part of the Rieselfelder became the new district of Rieselfeld, covering 18 hectares. Another area was turned into the Rieselfeld nature conservation area, which is situated between Rieselfeld and the Mundenhof estate.Until December 31, 1977, the grounds of the Mundenhof estate were part of the township of Umkirch, though it technically belonged to the city of Freiburg. On the January 1, 1978, it became fully integrated into the city of Freiburg as a result of a referendum among the residents. In return, Umkirch was given a smaller area, called Lehen, to the west of the nearby motorway, the A5. == Zoo == In 1968, the grounds were converted to a small outdoor zoo, called a Tiergehege in German to differentiate it from larger zoological gardens. It is the largest zoo in Baden-Württemberg, covering 38 hectares. Eugen Keidel, mayor of Freiburg im Breisgau at the time, was a strong supporter of the project, and on September 28, 1968, the zoo was opened to the public.In 1971 the Fördergemeinschaft Freiburger Tiergehege e.V. (Friends’ association for Freiburg zoological gardens) was founded. Domesticated species from all over the world and some undomesticated species can now be seen at the Mundenhof. A top priority of the Mundenhof zoo is to care for and display endangered domesticated species. The open-air exhibition ground is divided into eight sections, each of which are host to various species specific to particular continents. The zoo is home to peacocks, gibbons, crab-eating macaques, emus, ostriches, alpacas, yaks, llamas, and many other species. About 30 different species and about 180 individual animals can be observed. The Verein der Aquarien- und Terrarienfreunde e.V. (Friends‘ association of aquariums and terrariums) converted a former horse barn to house 3 terrariums and 12 pools. The pools range in volume from 500 liters (132 US gallons) to 3000 liters (792 US gallons), and they are divided into 5 salt water and 7 fresh water pools. This section of the park is also dependent on donations to exist, because entry is free. The park has many interconnecting paths with various viewing points with views of the city of Freiburg and the surrounding land. There is also a restaurant on the grounds of the Mundenhof, called the Hofwirtschaft. Next to the restaurant is a playground. A further attraction are the storks that nest on the Mundenhof grounds. Their nests are further off, but can easily be observed through binoculars. The zoo is open 24/7. There is no entrance fee, since the zoo is financed by donations, but a parking fee is another source of revenue. Bus line 19 takes visitors to the park. == KonTiKi == KonTiKi is a social program with the goal of bringing nature closer to children aged six and up. These children are given the opportunity to learn about flora and fauna in their free-time, so that they can learn how to treat nature with respect, take up the mantle of responsibility, and gather social experience. == Zelt-Musik-Festival/Tent Music Festival == Next to the Mundenhof zoo grounds is an area where the international Zelt-Musik-Festival (ZMF) takes place every year. It is one of the oldest events of its kind in Europe. Through its mixture of older and modern, more popular music, the Tent-Music-Festival attracts many music fans. The special feature of the festival is that all the events take place inside big-top tents. == References == == External links == Offizielle Website des Mundenhofs Fördergemeinschaft Freiburger Tiergehege e.

She was, according to traditional legend, ruler for a short period between Emperor Seinei and Emperor Kenzō. She is referred to as \\"Empress [Regnant] Iitoyo\\" (飯豊天皇 Iitoyo-tennō) in the Fusō Ryakuki and the Honchō Kōin Jōun-roku, a 12th-century and a 15th-century history respectively. == Descent == Princess Iitoyo, like the reigning Emperor Kenzō (Prince Oke ; ruled 485–487) and Ninken (Prince Ōke ; ruled 488–498) are said to be descended from the 17th Emperor Richū (ruled 400–405). The exact degree of this relationship is shown differently in the earliest chronicles from the 8th century : After the Kojiki of 712, Iitoyo was the younger sister of the imperial prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa and thus the daughter of Emperor Richū and aunt of the princes Ōke and Oke. In turn, according to the Nihon Shoki of 720, Iitoyo was the daughter of the prince and his wife Hayehime, making her the sister of Ōke and Oke and, like the two, a grandchild of Emperor Richū. == Regency and reign == According to the chronicles mentioned, after the death of the 20th Emperor Ankō (presumably ruled 453–456), his brother murdered all rivals who could claim the throne, and then ruled as the 21st Emperor Yūryaku (presumably ruled 456–479). His victims included above all his cousin Prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa, who was the eldest son and crown prince of Emperor Richū. While we learn that Oshiwa's sons Ōke and Oke fled to the province after his murder, there is no information about their aunt (sister, according to the Nihon shoki) Iitoyo during this time. Iitoyo appears in the chronicles for the first time in the history of the 22nd Emperor Seinei (presumably ruled 479–484), the son and successor of Emperor Yūryaku. Seinei had no children and otherwise no close relatives. Princes Ōke and Oke were in hiding, so another suitable heir to the throne from the lineage of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu had to be sought. According to the Kojiki, this search ended with the discovery of Princess Iitoyo at the Tsunusashi Palace, in Oshinumi, in Kazuragi. She then appears to have taken over as regent until Wodate, the governor of Harima province, sent a message to the capital after his discovery of princes Ōke and Oke. Iitoyo then gave the order to bring her nephews to her in the palace, where she presumably handed the rule over to Ōke. The course of these events is presented somewhat differently in the Nihon Shoki. The princes are found before the death of Emperor Seinei, so that he can elevate the older Ōke himself to the crown prince and Oke to the imperial prince. Iitoyo is briefly mentioned here for the first time in the narrative of Emperor Kenzo. The princes, after the death of Seinei, cannot agree which should succeed, since each wanted to leave the throne to the other. In the resulting interregnum, Iitoyo took over the reign and ruled the country from the Tsunuzashi Palace in Oshinomi. She gave herself the title Oshinomi no Ihitoyo no Awo no Mikoto, After eleven months in the winter of the same year, she died and was buried in a burial site (misasagi) on Mount Haniguchi in Katsuraki. == Reception == After Empress Jingū, Princess Iitoyo is the second woman described in the chronicles as having governed the country for a certain period of time. But she is generally not recognized as a ruling empress by historians and she does not appear in the official Japanese Emperor lists. In the 1219 Japanese historical work Gukanshō, written by the Buddhist monk Jien, Iitoyo was reigning empress, based on the explanation:\\"Since the two brothers were adamant to let the other go first, in the second month of the year in which Seine died, their young sister, Seine, succeeded the throne as ruling empress. But she herself died at 12 months [Note .: elsewhere 11 months ] of the same year. Perhaps this is the reason why we do not find their reign in the usual Imperial Chronicles and why we do not know anything about them. She was called Empress Iitoyo and it is said that they in Kinoe plans of the year 60-year cycle had prevailed. (Since the two brothers were unbending in deferring to each other, their young sister followed Seine on the throne as a reigning empress in the second month of the year in which Seine died. But she herself died in the 12th month of that same year. Perhaps that it is why we not find her reign listed in the ordinary Imperial chronologies and why people know nothing at all about her. She was calles Empress Iitoyo and it is said that her reign was in the kinoe-ne year of the sexegenary cycle. ) \\" - Jien: Gukanshō Iitoyo's entry as Empress Tsunuzashi in the Emperor list by Ernest Mason Satow, Japanese Chronological Tables , 1874. Even after Isaac Titsingh's translation of Nihon Ōdai Ichiran , which was written in 1625, Iitoyo was not counted among the official tennō because she had ruled for less than ten months, but she had been given a posthumous imperial name after her death (Japanese: 飯豊天皇 Empress Iitoyo). Iitoyo is also under other posthumous Empress name (Okurina) such as Empress Pagei and Empress Tsunuzachi also recognized as a sovereign empress on various occasions, for which information can also be found in the Nihon Shoki, if there is the term for her death bō is used, which is otherwise reserved exclusively for emperors. Historians have a variety of theories about their reign: Iitoyo, according to one, may be identical to Queen Taiyoo, a successor to Himiko, who ruled Yamatai. The historian Shinobu Orikuchi sees her as the first ruling empress in the history of Japan, who combines the roles of the shaman and the sovereign. Mitakō Mihoo, on the other hand, believes that Iitoyo was a rival ruler at the time of the 26th Emperor Keitai (traditionally ruled 507–531) before he became ruler of a unified Yamato. Mizuno Yū even argues that the Emperors Seinei, Kenzō, and Ninken did not exist at all, and that Iitoyo reigned after Emperor Yūryaku for 15 years. == Sources == Kojiki → Basil Hall Chamberlain: A Translation of the “Ko-ji-ki,” or “Records of ancient matters” , Read before the Asiatic Society of Japan April 12, May 10, and June 21, 1882; Reprinted, May, 1919.

In this section of the river, which is dammed in a number of places, it receives from the right the waters of the Edron, Tùrrite Secca, Tùrrite di Gallicano, Turrite Cava and the Pedogna; and from the left those of the Fiume, the Castiglione, the Sillico, and its most important tributary the Lima. This last, which is born at the Passo dell'Abetone and collects the waters of the Modenese and Pistoiese high Apennines, forms a sub-basin in its own right and achieves a mean discharge of more than 20 cubic metres per second (710 cu ft/s). Having reached the plain of Lucca, where it is joined by the torrent Freddana, the Serchio turns westwards, crosses the “straits” of Filettole, and enters the Province of Pisa.

After becoming a pharmacist under the supervision of Carl Magnus von Hell (known from the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation) at the University of Stuttgart he joined the group of Hermann Emil Fischer at the University of Berlin. Fischer was noted for his work on carbohydrates (sugars) and so Ruff started his career as an organic chemist. In 1898 he published his work on the transformation of d-Glucose to d-Arabinose, later called the Ruff degradation. Supported by the far-sighted Fischer, who recognized that while organic chemistry was now mature, physical chemistry was growing rapidly, Ruff became head of the new inorganic department in Berlin, working alongside Alfred Stock who was five years his junior. This drastic change in subject benefited Ruff during his work on chlorides sulfur compounds. In 1902 he married Meta Richter, a pharmacist, and from this marriage he had three children. In 1904 he became a professor at the Technical University of Danzig and from 1916 onward he was head of the inorganic chemistry department at the Technical University of Breslau. He died three years after his retirement in 1939. His last years of teaching were made miserable by a privatdozent and assistant, Helmut Hartmann, who had joined the Nazi party and became an \\"insolent politician\\" who made life unbearable for many. == Scientific achievements == Otto Ruff published 290 papers and two books. The books were: \\"The Chemistry of Fluorine\\" (published in 1920 by Springer Verlag, Berlin) and \\"Introduction to Chemical Practicum\\" (Leipzig 1926, 2nd edition 1937). His papers can be categorized as follows: chemistry of sugars (17 papers), inorganic chemistry of fluorine (86), high temperature chemistry (44), electrolysis of molten salts (9), plastics (10), carbides (20), explosions in mines (7), other fields of inorganic chemistry (72).Along with Svante Arrhenius, Henri Moissan, and Alfred Werner, all of whom received Nobel Prizes, O. Ruff was regarded as the driver of the achievements of inorganic chemistry in first decades of the 20th century. == See also == Ruff degradation == References == New link to Website of the Gdansk University of Technology (previously Technical University of Gdańsk): https://chem.pg.edu.pl/kchn/otto-ruff-en == Literature == W.Hückel (1940). \\"Obituary: Otto Ruff 30. 12. 1871 - 17. 9. 1939\\".

Here is an updated version of the code that includes tokenization: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import torch import torch.nn as nn import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from IPython.display import clear_output def tokenize_to_8bit(integers): # Converts a list of integers to a list of 8-bit binary numbers # represented as numpy arrays. return np.array([np.array(list(map(int, format(i, '08b')))) for i in integers]) # Example data: A list of integers (as sequences) int_sequences = [np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(10,)) for _ in range(100)] # Tokenization of sequences into 8-bit binary representations bin_sequences = np.array([tokenize_to_8bit(seq) for seq in int_sequences]) # Convert to PyTorch tensors data_tensor = torch.tensor(bin_sequences, dtype=torch.float32) # Define your neural network architecture, loss function, and optimizer here # *Refer to the previous neural network code provided* # Training loop with visualization num_epochs = 100 num_samples = len(data_tensor) for epoch in range(num_epochs): for i, sample in enumerate(data_tensor): # sample is a tensor of shape (sequence_length, binary_representation_size) # Flatten the sample for feeding into the network flat_sample = sample.view(-1) # Forward pass outputs = net(flat_sample) loss = criterion(outputs, flat_sample) # Backward and optimize optimizer.zero_grad() loss.backward() optimizer.step() # Visualization if i % 10 == 0: # Unflatten outputs for visualization unflat_output = outputs.view(sample.shape) clear_output(wait=True) fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, sample.shape[0], figsize=(15, 4)) for seq_i in range(sample.shape[0]): axs[0, seq_i].imshow(sample[seq_i].reshape(1, -1), cmap='binary', aspect='auto') axs[0, seq_i].axis('off') axs[1, seq_i].imshow(unflat_output[seq_i].detach().numpy().reshape(1, -1), cmap='binary', aspect='auto') axs[1, seq_i].axis('off') plt.suptitle(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Sample [{i+1}/{num_samples}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}') plt.show() # Remember to define your BinarySequenceNet, and update sequence_length and batch_size according to your dataset and application. \`\`\` In this enhanced example: - We created a function \`tokenize_to_8bit\` that takes integers and converts them to 8-bit binary arrays. - We added an example integer dataset \`int_sequences\` which we assume is a list of lists (sequences) of integers. - We then tokenize the integer sequences using \`tokenize_to_8bit\` function. - We updated the training loop to handle the sequences properly and visualize the learning process in each step, showing the original and predicted binary sequences per epoch. Please note that this example uses random integers and does not persist the model, so you should save your model after training if needed and handle input data accordingly."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular big cat animal, one word only","output":"Tiger"},{"instruction":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

It is used to apply various query options such as loading related objects, controlling the transaction isolation level, or changing the query execution behavior. This method takes one or more option objects as arguments, which can be created using various built-in options classes provided by SQLAlchemy. Some commonly used options classes include \`subqueryload\`, \`joinedload\`, \`contains_eager\`, \`with_lockmode\`, and \`with_for_update\`. Here's an example of how to use \`query.options\`: \`\`\`python from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload from mymodels import User Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine) session = Session() # Basic query query = session.query(User) # Applying an option to eagerly load related objects query = query.options(joinedload(User.items)) result = query.all() \`\`\` In the above example, \`joinedload\` is used to indicate that when the query is executed, the related \`User.items\` objects should be eagerly loaded along with the \`User\` objects. This can help minimize the number of individual queries required to fetch the related objects. Note that \`query.options\` method can be used multiple times on the same query to apply multiple options. The options are generally applied to the query's \`SELECT\`, \`FROM\`, and \`WHERE\` clauses as appropriate.

Prowadzenie statystyk na temat przestępczości opiera się przede wszystkim na zgłoszeniach i prowadzonych sprawach. Zbierane w ten sposób dane są danymi niepełnymi (nie wszystkie sprawy zostają wykryte oraz nie wszystkie ofiary zgłaszają się do organów ścigania). W przypadku zjawiska korupcji zbieranie takich danych jest podwójnie trudne – interesem zarówno strony korumpującej jak i korumpowanej jest pozostanie w cieniu i niewykrycie procederu. Korupcja będąca najczęściej przestępstwem „bez ofiar” oznacza, że poszkodowane są zazwyczaj szersze grupy społeczne lub całe społeczeństwo, a nie pojedyncze jednostki. Sprawia, że świadomość i wola zgłaszania takich przestępstw są znacznie mniejsze. Ponadto, istnieje wiele form i poziomów korupcji, od drobnych łapówek po zorganizowaną korupcję na wysokich szczeblach władzy, co dodatkowo komplikuje jej identyfikację i pomiar. Sposoby jej realizacji są często wyrafinowane i wymagają dogłębnej analizy, aby zostały właściwie zrozumiane i sklasyfikowane. Wymiar prawny również nastręcza trudności – definicje korupcji różnią się w zależności od jurysdykcji, co wpływa na to, jak jest ona mierzona i porównywana w różnych krajach i regionach. To z kolei może prowadzić do niejednoznaczności i problemów z międzynarodową współpracą w jej zwalczaniu. Powszechnie wykorzystywanym sposobem pozwalającym oszacować poziom zjawiska korupcji są ankiety dotyczące percepcji korupcji lub analizy działalności gospodarczej. Chociaż takie metody dostarczają istotnych informacji, nie są one wolne od ograniczeń – na przykład, opierają się na subiektywnej ocenie respondentów, co może prowadzić do zniekształceń.","output":"Znaczące wyzwania w procesie definiowania korupcji manifestują się również podczas jej kwantyfikacji. Ewidencja danych kryminologicznych jest fundamentowana głównie na oficjalnych doniesieniach oraz rozpatrzonych kwestiach prawnych. Akumulacja informacji w taki sposób generuje corpus niekompletny (nie każde wykroczenie zostaje wykryte, a nie wszystkie pokrzywdzone jednostki zgłaszają nieprawidłowości do odpowiednich organów ścigania). W odniesieniu do fenomenu korupcji, aktywność zbierania takich danych cechuje się nadmierną trudnością, jako że obie strony transakcji korupcyjnej - dokonujący korupcji oraz jej odbiorca - mają wspólny cel, jakim jest utrzymanie anonimowości i niedoprowadzenie do wykrycia dokonania. Korupcja, będąc z reguły przestępstwem „bezpośrednio ofiarowym”, pociąga za sobą fakt, iż poszkodowanymi są przeważnie nie pojedyncze osoby, ale szersze zbiorowości społeczne lub nawet cała struktura społeczna, co znacząco redukuje świadomość oraz zainteresowanie zgłoszeniem tego typu wykroczeń. Dodatkowo, rozległa heterogeniczność korupcji, począwszy od nieznacznych nielegalnych gratyfikacji aż po zorganizowaną korupcję na wyższych poziomach hierarchii władz, dalej komplikuje jej identyfikację oraz procedurę pomiaru. Metody jej operacjonalizacji bywają zadziwiająco złożone i potwierdzają potrzebę szczegółowej analizy celem adekwatnego zrozumienia i klasyfikacji. Także wymiar prawny stwarza pewne komplikacje – definiowanie korupcji jest niespójne zależnie od przepisów prawnych danej jurysdykcji, co bezpośrednio oddziałuje na metodologię mierzenia oraz porównywalność tego zjawiska w różnorodnych państwach i regionach. To z kolei może generować ambiwalencje oraz przeszkody w zakresie międzynarodowej kooperacji w obszarze przeciwdziałania korupcji. Metody często stosowane w celu oceny stopnia występowania korupcji obejmują sondaże dotyczące percepcji korupcji lub analizy zachowań na płaszczyźnie ekonomicznej.

Korupcja może pogłębiać nierówności społeczne poprzez utrudnianie dostępu do usług publicznych dla osób mniej zamożnych i wykluczonych. Ponadto, może prowadzić do naruszenia podstawowych praw człowieka, w tym prawa do uczciwego i bezstronnego sądu, równości wobec prawa, a także prawa do zdrowia, edukacji i innych usług społecznych, gdyż osoby lub grupy mogą być dyskryminowane lub pomijane ze względu na nieuczestnictwo w aktach korupcyjnych. Również brakuje dyskusji na temat znaczenia społecznego zaangażowania i edukacji w zwalczaniu korupcji.

Blibby (with wonder in voice): “May I? Your glow is so intriguing!” Gloopy: “Sure thing, Blibby. But prepare for a slime surprise!” - When Blibby touches Gloopy, her hand comes away covered in teal goo, much to her amazement. Blibby: “Oh! It’s soft and squishy! And… it’s not sticky! What a marvelous sensation!” Scene 4: The Slime Session - Gloopy laughs and jiggles, while Glitter uses her sparkles to clean up the goo from Blibby’s hand, leaving a twinkle on her skin. - Overcoming the initial shock, Blibby is now brimming with excitement and requests a lesson in slime play from Gloopy and Glitter. Glitter: “Let’s give Blibby the ultimate slime experience! Ready to get your hands goopy?” Blibby: “Yes, please! Teach me your slimy ways!” Scene 5: Slimey Shenanigans - Gloopy shows Blibby how to bounce and mold the slime into different shapes, sparking joy and laughter. - Glitter teaches Blibby how to make sparkly goo, combining their textures into a dazzling visual display. Blibby (with glee): “This is incredible! Our people love new forms of art. With your slime, the possibilities are endless!” Gloopy: “Sharing our slime is our pleasure, Blibby!” Scene 6: An Artsy Farewell - As the day ends, they invite Blibby to share this newfound art with the rest of Rosalux. - The pink world soon becomes a canvas of colorful slime sculptures and glittery designs, thanks to their collaborative effort. Glitter: “You’re a natural, Blibby! Rosalux looks even more stunning now!” Blibby: “Thank you, Gloopy and Glitter. We’ll treasure this slimy, sparkly art forever!” Scene 7: Departure to Dazzle Another Day - Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to their new friend and her pink planet as they board their repaired blob-mobile. - They set off into the cosmos, eager for the next whimsical adventure, leaving behind a legacy of laughter and slime-art on Rosalux.

THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign! Stay toony, and let’s look forward to positive news about our favorite show’s return!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I'm not gonna lie, I'm kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how \\"World of Quest\\" fits in. And \\"Ozzy and Drix\\"? That's a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for \\"Skatoony.\\" I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. \\"Ozzy and Drix\\" is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don't you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss \\"Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.\\" They were just hitting their stride!

User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I'm willing to give \\"World of Quest\\" a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. \\"Johnny Test\\" is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of \\"Batman\\" and \\"Spider-Man\\" though. Big shoes for \\"World of Quest\\" to fill if it's trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like \\"Batman: The Brave and the Bold,\\" \\"Ultimate Spider-Man,\\" and \\"Scooby-Doo: MI.\\" Fingers crossed for their return. Here's hoping \\"World of Quest\\" brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way.

When you mention \\"each word represented as 8-bit chunks\\", I'll assume you mean that each letter is represented by its ASCII value in binary, using 8 bits for each letter. Here is the Python code that will take a text sequence and convert it into binary representation, where each character is represented as an 8-bit chunk (including spaces): \`\`\`python def text_to_binary(text): binary_sequence = '' for char in text: # Convert the character to binary and remove the '0b' prefix binary_char = bin(ord(char))[2:] # Pad the binary representation to 8 bits binary_char = binary_char.zfill(8) binary_sequence += binary_char return binary_sequence if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": text_sequence = input(\\"Enter your text: \\") binary_representation = text_to_binary(text_sequence) print(\\"Binary representation:\\", binary_representation) \`\`\` Running this code, and inputting a text sequence, will give you a string consisting of the binary representations of each character in the sequence. Here's an example: \`\`\` Enter your text: Hello World Binary representation: 0100100001100101011011000110110001101111001000000101011101101111011100100110110001100100 \`\`\` Keep in mind that Python already uses Unicode (UTF-8) as the default string encoding, so the \`ord()\` function will give you the Unicode code point for characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane, which for standard ASCII characters will match perfectly with their corresponding 8-bit binary values as assumed above. If the input includes characters beyond the ASCII range (0-127), they will not be represented in 8 bits using the \`ord\` function and the padding to 8 bits; such characters have larger code points and therefore require more bits. For handling non-ASCII characters, the encoding process becomes more complex and could differ based on the desired output format."},{"instruction":"Now, i will create a simple Customizable RNN model to model the sequence of ASCII values and try to approach it and then turn the predictions of the model back into readable text","output":"This task involves creating a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), feeding it a sequence of ASCII values, and then interpreting the model's predictions as text. Since you want to build a customizable RNN, I'll provide a template in Python using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. This code will demonstrate how you could construct an RNN, train it on sequences of ASCII characters from your input text, and convert the predictions back into readable text. The model will predict the next character in the sequence given previous characters. Firstly, make sure you have TensorFlow installed. If not, you can install it using pip: \`\`\` pip install tensorflow \`\`\` And here is an example Python code: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding # Define constants SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 40 # The length of the input sequences BATCH_SIZE = 128 # The size of the training batches VOCAB_SIZE = 128 # ASCII goes up to 127, we reserve 0 for 'padding' character # A sample text input. In practice, you would use a much larger dataset. text = \\"This is a simple example text to demonstrate the RNN. Try using longer text.\\" # Convert characters to ASCII values ascii_characters = [ord(c) for c in text] # Create training sequences inputs, targets = [], [] for i in range(0, len(ascii_characters) - SEQUENCE_LENGTH): inputs.append(ascii_characters[i:i + SEQUENCE_LENGTH]) targets.append(ascii_characters[i + 1:i + SEQUENCE_LENGTH + 1]) # Convert lists to numpy arrays inputs = np.array(inputs) targets = np.array(targets) # One-hot encode the targets targets = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(targets, num_classes=VOCAB_SIZE) # Create the RNN model model = Sequential([ Embedding(VOCAB_SIZE, 8, input_length=SEQUENCE_LENGTH), LSTM(128, return_sequences=True), Dense(VOCAB_SIZE, activation='softmax') ]) model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) model.summary() # Train the model model.fit(inputs, targets, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, epochs=50) # Function to convert model predictions back to text def predictions_to_text(predictions): text_output = \\"\\" for prediction in predictions: text_output += chr(np.argmax(prediction)) return text_output # Make a prediction based on a seed sequence seed_sequence = inputs[0].reshape(1, SEQUENCE_LENGTH) prediction = model.predict(seed_sequence) # Convert prediction to text predicted_text = predictions_to_text(prediction[0]) print(predicted_text) \`\`\` Please note that due to the complexity of language and the small example model, your model's predictions might not make sense if trained on such a small amount of text. Normally, you'd use a much larger corpus with potentially thousands to millions of characters to train a decent character-based RNN. Furthermore, RNNs might struggle with very long-term dependencies, so for advanced and effective text generation, consider using more sophisticated architectures like LSTMs (shown in the example) or GRUs, or even Transformer models. Lastly, the above placeholder text and number of epochs are chosen for demonstration and will not yield a useful text prediction. For any meaningful results, you'd need to train on a more extensive dataset for many more epochs. You may also want to implement specific text preprocessing, handle punctuation, and include additional functionalities according to your needs."},{"instruction":"Convert the code to a torch implementation instead","output":"Sure, I'll provide a simple PyTorch RNN model that accepts sequences of ASCII codes as input and attempts to predict the next character in the sequence, similar to the previous example with TensorFlow.

Чтобы определить этот радиус, необходимо рассмотреть скорость сближения объектов и время реакции системы. Мы знаем следующее: - Скорость автомобиля ( V_{car} = 80 ) км/ч - Скорость дрона ( V_{drone} = 120 ) км/ч - Скорость сближения ( V_{relative} = V_{drone} - V_{car} = 120 ) км/ч - ( 80 ) км/ч = ( 40 ) км/ч - Высота полета дрона 30 метров (не влияет на горизонтальное расстояние сближения, но важна для угловой направленности антенны глушилки) - Время реакции системы глушения 1 секунда Для начала переведём скорость сближения из километров в час в метры в секунду, так как время реакции дано в секундах: [ V_{relative} = 40 ) км/ч = ( 40 times dfrac{1000 ) м/км}{3600 ) с/ч} = dfrac{40000}{3600} ) м/с ≈ 11.11 ) м/с ] Теперь мы можем вычислить, какое расстояние преодолеет дрон за время реакции системы: [ S = V_{relative} times t = 11.11 ) м/с times 1 ) с = 11.11 ) м ] То есть, за одну секунду дрон преодолеет примерно 11.11 метров по направлению к автомобилю. Эффективный радиус действия системы глушения должен быть как минимум на это расстояние больше, чтобы обеспечить перехват дрона до того, как он окажется над автомобилем (при условии, что система начинает действовать, как только дрон попадает в радиус действия). Если система начнет глушить, когда дрон уже находится в пределах этого радиуса, то учитывая время реакции, дрон все равно пролетит 11.11 метров внутри зоны действия системы, прежде чем будет остановлен или выведен из строя. Итак, минимальный эффективный радиус действия системы глушения: [ R_{effective} = S + некий запас на безопасность (например, 20% S) ] Допустим, мы добавляем 20% для надежности: [ R_{effective} = 11.11 ) м + 20% times 11.11 ) м = 11.11 ) м + 2.22 ) м = 13.33 ) м ] Следовательно, эффективный радиус действия системы глушения, который учитывает время реакции и гарантирует, что дрон будет нейтрализован до достижения автомобиля, должен быть не менее 13.33 метров. В этом случае система будет работать эффективно даже при условии внезапного появления дрона и минимального времени на его обнаружение и реакцию на угрозу."},{"instruction":"Можешь сделать описание в расчетах более понятное: Расстояние до падения дрона после подавления сигнала можно оценить так. Применим формулу свободного падения: d = (g * t^2) / 2, где g — ускорение свободного падения (≈9,81 м/с^2) и t — время падения в секундах. Теперь нам необходимо определить время падения t: t = √(2d/g),где d — высота, с которой падает дрон (30 м). t = √(2*30/9,81) ≈ √(60/9,81) ≈ √6,12 ≈ 2,47 сек. Это время, за которое дрон упадёт на землю при свободном падении без учёта аэродинамического сопротивления воздуха. Однако в реальных условиях падение займёт больше времени из-за сопротивления воздуха. Теперь вычислим расстояние, которое должен преодолеть автомобиль, чтобы не попасть в зону поражения дрона. Для этого умножим среднюю скорость автомобиля на время падения дрона. Средняя скорость автомобиля равна (80+100)/2 км/ч = 90 км/ч = 25 м/с (1 километр/час = 0,2777778 метров/секунду). Теперь расстояние до остановки автомобиля будет: S = v * t = 25 м/с * 2,47 с ≈ 61,75 м. В таком формате более удобно.","output":"Конечно, давайте пошагово разобьем процесс расчета на более подробные и понятные шаги. **1. Определение времени падения дрона** Формула свободного падения: [ d = frac{gt^2}{2}, ] где ( g ) — ускорение свободного падения (( approx 9,81 , м/с^2 )) и ( t ) — время падения в секундах. Нам известна высота, с которой падает дрон (( 30 ) м), и мы хотим найти время падения ( t ). Используем формулу, чтобы найти время: [ t = sqrt{frac{2d}{g}} ] [ t = sqrt{frac{2 cdot 30 , м}{9,81 , м/с^2}} = sqrt{frac{60}{9,81}} , с ] [ t approx sqrt{6,12} , с approx 2,47 , с. ] Таким образом, время падения дрона в идеальных условиях без учета сопротивления воздуха составляет примерно ( 2,47 ) секунды. **2. Расчет расстояния, которое пройдет автомобиль за время падения дрона** Нам надо определить расстояние, которое пройдет автомобиль за время падения дрона. Сначала найдем среднюю скорость автомобиля: Средняя скорость автомобиля равна: [ v = frac{(V_{max} + V_{min})}{2}, ] но поскольку нам дана конкретная скорость ( V_{car} = 80 ) км/ч, то пользуемся этим значением. Переведем скорость автомобиля в метры в секунду: [ V_{car} = 80 , км/ч = 80 cdot 0,2777778 , м/с approx 22,22 , м/с ] Теперь, зная скорость и время, можно найти расстояние до падения дрона: [ S_{car} = V_{car} cdot t = 22,22 , м/с cdot 2,47 , с approx 54,89 , м ] Таким образом, автомобиль успеет пройти примерно ( 54,89 ) метров за время падения дрона с высоты ( 30 ) метров в условиях отсутствия воздушного сопротивления. Это значит, что если система глушения сработала и дрон начал падать, автомобиль должен быть как минимум на этом расстоянии, чтобы избежать возможности столкновения с падающим дроном."},{"instruction":"ОЧЕНЬ НЕУДОБНЫЙ ФОРМАТ расчета: Давайте сосредоточимся на определении эффективного радиуса действия системы глушения дронов с учетом данных условий. Чтобы определить этот радиус, необходимо рассмотреть скорость сближения объектов и время реакции системы. Мы знаем следующее: - Скорость автомобиля ( V_{car} = 80 ) км/ч - Скорость дрона ( V_{drone} = 120 ) км/ч - Скорость сближения ( V_{relative} = V_{drone} - V_{car} = 120 ) км/ч - ( 80 ) км/ч = ( 40 ) км/ч - Высота полета дрона 30 метров (не влияет на горизонтальное расстояние сближения, но важна для угловой направленности антенны глушилки) - Время реакции системы глушения 1 секунда Для начала переведём скорость сближения из километров в час в метры в секунду, так как время реакции дано в секундах: [ V_{relative} = 40 ) км/ч = ( 40 times dfrac{1000 ) м/км}{3600 ) с/ч} = dfrac{40000}{3600} ) м/с ≈ 11.11 ) м/с ] Теперь мы можем вычислить, какое расстояние преодолеет дрон за время реакции системы: [ S = V_{relative} times t = 11.11 ) м/с times 1 ) с = 11.11 ) м ] То есть, за одну секунду дрон преодолеет примерно 11.11 метров по направлению к автомобилю. Эффективный радиус действия системы глушения должен быть как минимум на это расстояние больше, чтобы обеспечить перехват дрона до того, как он окажется над автомобилем (при условии, что система начинает действовать, как только дрон попадает в радиус действия). Если система начнет глушить, когда дрон уже находится в пределах этого радиуса, то учитывая время реакции, дрон все равно пролетит 11.11 метров внутри зоны действия системы, прежде чем будет остановлен или выведен из строя. Итак, минимальный эффективный радиус действия системы глушения: [ R_{effective} = S + некий запас на безопасность (например, 20% S) ] Допустим, мы добавляем 20% для надежности: [ R_{effective} = 11.11 ) м + 20% times 11.11 ) м = 11.11 ) м + 2.22 ) м = 13.33 ) м ] Следовательно, эффективный радиус действия системы глушения, который учитывает время реакции и гарантирует, что дрон будет нейтрализован до достижения автомобиля, должен быть не менее 13.33 метров. В этом случае система будет работать эффективно даже при условии внезапного появления дрона и минимального времени на его обнаружение и реакцию на угрозу. Какие то скобки подчеркиванияи так далее. Мы люди так не пишим.","output":"Понял вас, давайте переформулируем вычисления в стандартный текстовый формат, без использования математических обозначений. Для начала нам нужно перевести скорость сближения между дроном и автомобилем из километров в час в метры в секунду. Скорость сближения равна разности скоростей дрона и автомобиля: 120 км/ч - 80 км/ч = 40 км/ч. Переводим 40 км/ч в метры в секунду: один километр час это примерно 0.28 метра в секунду, поэтому 40 км/ч это примерно 11.1 м/с. Теперь рассмотрим, какое расстояние преодолеет дрон за время реакции системы глушения, которое составляет 1 секунду. Умножаем скорость сближения на время реакции: 11.1 м/с * 1 с = 11.1 метра. За одну секунду дрон успеет пролететь 11.1 метра в направлении автомобиля. Минимальный эффективный радиус действия системы глушения — это расстояние, на котором система должна активироваться, чтобы поймать дрона до его приближения к автомобилю. Мы добавим к пройденному дроном расстоянию небольшой запас, чтобы обеспечить надежность системы. Допустим, что мы хотим добавить примерно 20% от пройденного расстояния в качестве запаса. Рассчитаем эффективный радиус с учетом запаса: 11.1 м + (20% от 11.1 м) = 11.1 м + 2.22 м = 13.32 метра. Итак, чтобы гарантировать безопасность автомобиля и нейтрализовать дрон до его приближения, система глушения должна активироваться, когда дрон находится на расстоянии не менее 13.32 метра от автомобиля. Это будет минимально необходимый радиус действия системы глушения для данной ситуации."},{"instruction":"Ты уверен проведи подробное исследование, расчеты, необходимые предположения!","output":"Давайте проведём полное исследование, рассмотрим все необходимые шаги для определения эффективного радиуса действия системы глушения.

Скорость полета уменьшит вертикальное время падения, но увеличит горизонтальное перемещение. 6. **Эффективность системы глушения** — разные системы имеют различные характеристики мощности и способности подавления сигналов на разных расстояниях и высотах. 7. **Протоколы безопасности дрона** — при потере сигнала или иных сбоях дроны могут входить в режим безопасного возвращения или приземления. 8. **Внешние условия** — погодные условия, наличие препятствий и другие элементы окружающей среды могут влиять на полет и падение дрона. Учитывая все это, давайте пересмотрим наши расчеты: **Для автомобиля:** - Скорость: 80 км/ч ≈ 22.22 м/с - Время реакции: допустим, что оно включает время на обнаружение дрона и запуск системы глушения. Мы примем время реакции системы за 1 секунду, но добавим секунду на обнаружение, всего получается 2 секунды. **Для дрона:** - Скорость: 120 км/ч ≈ 33.33 м/с - Скорость сближения: 33.33 м/с - 22.22 м/с ≈ 11.11 м/с - Дистанция преодолеваемая за время реакции системы: 11.11 м/с * 2 секунды = 22.22 метра **Добавим дополнительный запас безопасности:** - Допускаем, что помимо времени на потерю управления и начало падения, потребуется дополнительное время или расстояние на случай возможных аварийных протоколов. Пусть система глушения покрывает дрон на расстоянии в два раза больше вычисленного выше. - Эффективный радиус действия со всеми запасами: 22.22 метра * 2 ≈ 44.44 метра **Вывод:** Для обеспечения максимальной безопасности и учета реальных сценариев, эффективный радиус действия системы должен составлять примерно 45 метров. Это позволит автомобилю оставаться вне зоны падения дрона и задействовать систему глушения достаточно рано для нейтрализации угрозы."},{"instruction":"А как включить в расчеты некий запас. например сегодня летят со скоростью 120 км/ч , а если новые полетят 140 -160 км/ч","output":"Если мы хотим учесть будущие технологические улучшения и рассмотреть возможность, что дроны будут летать со скоростью 140-160 км/ч, тогда нам нужен будет запас в наших расчетах, чтобы система глушения оставалась эффективной и в этих условиях.

Это также потребует обновления системы глушения в соответствии с технологическими изменениями в сфере дронов."},{"instruction":"А ты же ранее так считал и на 2 умножал","output":"Извините за недопонимание. Да, в предыдущем ответе я дал рекомендацию удвоить расстояние, полученное из расчетов, чтобы создать дополнительный запас для рассматриваемых условий с учетом сложностей реальной обстановки. При учете более высоких скоростей дронов это становится еще более важно для обеспечения безопасности. Теперь, используя новые предполагаемые скорости дронов (140-160 км/ч), повторим вычисления и применим тот же принцип удвоения для определения эффективного радиуса действия системы глушения: 1. **Рассмотрим скорость дрона в 160 км/ч (максимальный сценарий):** 160 км/ч равняется примерно 44.44 м/с (160 * 0.27778 м/с). 2. **Максимальная скорость сближения (учитывая скорость автомобиля 80 км/ч):** 44.44 м/с (скорость дрона) - 22.22 м/с (скорость автомобиля) = 22.22 м/с. 3. **Расстояние, которое дрон пролетит за 2 секунды (1 секунда реакции системы + 1 секунда запаса):** 22.22 м/с * 2 с ≈ 44.44 м. 4. **Удваиваем для создания безопасного запаса:** 44.44 м * 2 ≈ 88.88 м. Чтобы обеспечить эффективную работу системы глушения для дронов, которые могут иметь скорость до 160 км/ч, и включить запас на неопределенности, такие как различия в обработке сигнала и аэродинамическое сопротивление, мы приходим к выводу, что эффективный радиус действия системы должен составлять около 90 метров. Этот запас позволит системе глушения учесть не только текущие скорости дронов, но и потенциальное будущее увеличение скоростей до 160 км/ч, а также другие факторы, которые могут затруднить немедленное подавление сигнала и контроля над дроном."},{"instruction":"А тут автомобиль, оснащённый купольной системой защиты, мчится со скоростью 80-100 км/ч; навстречу в лоб заходит дрон-камикадзе со скоростью 80-100 км/ч. Общая скорость сближения 160-200 км/ч. Вопрос: на каком расстоянии от приближающегося автомобиля должно произойти подавление канала управления дрона, если он летит в лоб автомобилю с обозначенной выше скоростью с высоты, например, 30 метров? И чтобы автомобиль не въехал в зону поражения упавшего и взорвавшегося дрона на пути следования авто? Ответ был твой: Для ответа на данный вопрос необходимо учитывать несколько переменных: 1. Время реакции системы защиты. 2. Скорость подавления управляющего сигнала и скорость падения дрона после того, как сигнал подавлен. 3. Скорость автомобиля и дрона. 4. Параметры зоны поражения дрона-камикадзе при взрыве. Допустим, что система подавления работает мгновенно, и допустим, что дрон также мгновенно теряет контроль и начинает падение. В реальности это не так, но для расчёта возьмём упрощённые условия. Расстояние до падения дрона после подавления сигнала можно оценить так. Применим формулу свободного падения: d = (g * t^2) / 2, где g — ускорение свободного падения (≈9,81 м/с^2) и t — время падения в секундах. Теперь нам необходимо определить время падения t: t = √(2d/g),где d — высота, с которой падает дрон (30 м). t = √(2*30/9,81) ≈ √(60/9,81) ≈ √6,12 ≈ 2,47 сек. Это время, за которое дрон упадёт на землю при свободном падении без учёта аэродинамического сопротивления воздуха. Однако в реальных условиях падение займёт больше времени из-за сопротивления воздуха. Теперь вычислим расстояние, которое должен преодолеть автомобиль, чтобы не попасть в зону поражения дрона. Для этого умножим среднюю скорость автомобиля на время падения дрона. Средняя скорость автомобиля равна (80+100)/2 км/ч = 90 км/ч = 25 м/с (1 километр/час = 0,2777778 метров/секунду). Теперь расстояние до остановки автомобиля будет: S = v * t = 25 м/с * 2,47 с ≈ 61,75 м. Теперь добавим зону поражения дрона. Если зона поражения будет, к примеру, 30 метров, нам нужно чтобы автомобиль остановился на расстоянии не менее 30 метров от места падения дрона: Общее безопасное расстояние = расстояние до остановки автомобиля + зона поражения дрона Общее безопасное расстояние = 61,75 м + 30 м = 91,75 м. Таким образом, система защиты должна подавить управляющий сигнал дрона на расстоянии не менее 91,75 метров от автомобиля. Это предполагает мгновенное подавление сигнала и мгновенное падение дрона, что, конечно, является упрощением. В реальности же следует учесть задержки в реакции системы защиты, время на подавление сигнала и более медленное падение дрона, что может увеличить необходимое расстояние для обеспечения безопасности. Этот расчет не учитывал возможный прогресс скорости дрона. Пусть он будет 160км/час. И еще нужно учесть по максимуму чтобы предположить максимально возможные предварительные расчетные данные максимально приближенные к реальным.","output":"Давайте разберем сначала вашу задачу и ее условия, а затем учтем дополнительный потенциальный прогресс в скорости дрона до 160 км/ч для максимальной оценки. # Исходные условия: - Скорость автомобиля: 80-100 км/ч - Скорость дрона-камикадзе: 80-100 км/ч - Высота полета дрона: 30 метров - Зона поражения при взрыве дрона: 30 метров # Расчёты: 1. **Средняя скорость сближения:** Предыдущие расчеты основаны на средней скорости сближения (относительная скорость движения автомобиля и дрона друг к другу), которая составляла (80+100)/2 = 90 км/ч = 25 м/с. Если учесть, что дрон может двигаться со скоростью до 160 км/ч, то средняя скорость сближения с автомобилем, который движется со скоростью 80 км/ч, будет: Скорость сближения = скорость дрона + скорость автомобиля = 160 км/ч + 80 км/ч = 240 км/ч В метрах в секунду это составит: 240 км/ч * 0.277778 м/с на км/ч ≈ 66.67 м/с 2. **Расстояние, пройденное автомобилем за время падения дрона:** Если использовать вышеуказанное упрощение, что дрон падает 2.47 секунды (при отсутствии аэродинамического сопротивления), то автомобиль преодолеет: S_car = v_car * t = 66.67 м/с * 2.47 с ≈ 164.7 метров 3. **Зона поражения при взрыве дрона:** Добавляем зону поражения к расстоянию, которое пройдет автомобиль, чтобы обеспечить безопасность: Общее безопасное расстояние = расстояние, пройденное автомобилем за время падения дрона + зона поражения Общее безопасное расстояние = 164.7 м + 30 м = 194.7 метров # Вывод: Учитывая предположение о максимальной скорости дрона в 160 км/ч, система защиты должна быть способна подавить управляющий сигнал дрона как минимум на расстоянии 194.7 метров от автомобиля для обеспечения безопасности от взрыва при падении. Однако, чтобы быть еще более близкими к реальности и включить в расчеты аэродинамическое сопротивление, реальное время на подавление сигнала и реакцию дрона на подавление, нужно учитывать, что падение дрона займет больше времени, чем свободное падение. Следовательно, дистанция до зоны безопасности может быть больше. Кроме того, нужно также учесть возможную дистанцию взрывной волны и разлета осколков.

Os tuljave je v smeri V-Z. Če po tuljavi spustimo tok 0,069 A, se kompas zasuče za 15° in obmiruje. Tuljava ima 130 ovojev in dolzino 1,5 m. Za koliko stopinj bi se zasukala igla, če bi tuljavo skrajšali za 13 ovojev (tudi dolžina se ustrezno spremeni), toka po tuljavi pa ne bi spreminjali?","output":"Najprej ugotovimo, kako kompasni igli vpliva magnetno polje tuljave. Pri tem se bom osredotočil na magnetni moment ( M ) tuljave, ki je sorazmeren s številom ovojev ( N ), tokom ( I ) in površino ( A ) tuljave. Ker je os tuljave v smeri V-Z, še vedno vzporedno s površino Zemlje, kompasni igli vpliva le horizontalna sestavina magnetnega polja tuljave, ki je normalna na smer sever-jug. Magnetni moment ( M ) tuljave je podan kot: [ M = N cdot I cdot A ] kjer je ( A ) površina tuljave. Ko ni toka, kompas kaže na geomagnetni sever zaradi Zemljinega magnetnega polja. Ko tok steče skozi tuljavo, ustvari dodatno magnetno polje, ki povzroči, da se kompasna igla zasuče za določen kot. Ker je sprememba kota kompasa sorazmerna z magnetnim momentom tuljave, lahko razmerje med spremembo kota in številom ovojev izrazimo kot: [ frac{Delta theta}{N} = text{konstanta} ] kjer je ( Delta theta ) sprememba kota in ( N ) število ovojev. Privzamemo, da je v originalnem stanju za ( N_1 = 130 ) ovojev in ( Delta theta_1 = 15^circ ), potem velja: [ frac{15^circ}{130} = frac{Delta theta_1}{N_1} ] Če želimo izvedeti, za koliko stopinj bi se zasukala igla z ( N_2 = N_1 - 13 = 130 - 13 = 117 ), uporabimo zgornjo formulo, pri čemer je ( Delta theta_2 ) novi kot za skrajšano tuljavo: [ frac{Delta theta_2}{117} = frac{Delta theta_1}{130} ] Razrešimo enačbo za ( Delta theta_2 ): [ Delta theta_2 = Delta theta_1 times frac{117}{130} ] [ Delta theta_2 = 15^circ times frac{117}{130} ] [ Delta theta_2 = 15^circ times 0,9 ] [ Delta theta_2 = 13,5^circ ] Igla bi se torej zasukala za 13,5°, če bi tuljavo skrajšali za 13 ovojev in obdržali isti tok.

Pogledali bomo problem še enkrat. Izvirni tok na tuljavi ( I ), število ovojev ( N ), in dolžina tuljave ( l ) povzročajo magnetno polje, ki iglo kompasa zasuče za 15°. Ko zmanjšamo število ovojev na ( N' = N - 13 ), moramo upoštevati spremembo dolžine tuljave, saj se bo reduciralo tudi sorazmerno. Vendar, kot je razvidno iz enačb elektromagnetizma, za določanje smeri igle kompasa vpliva razmerje število ovojev ( N ) na dolžino ( L ), in sicer skozi magnetno indukcijo ( B ) v tuljavi ali natančneje magnetni moment tuljave. Magnetna dipolni moment tuljave ( mu ) je sorazmeren magnetni indukciji ( B ) tuljave, števila ovojev ( N ), toka ( I ), in površine ( A ) skozi katero tok teče: [ mu = N cdot I cdot A ] Ko zmanjšamo ovoje in skrajšamo dolžino tuljave, se površina ( A ) zmanjša sorazmerno z dolžino, ( A' = (l' / l) A ), kjer je ( l' ) nova dolžina tuljave. Kljub temu pa sta oba magnetna dipolna momenta pri originalni in pri spremenjeni tuljavi enaka, ker čeprav zmanjšamo število ovojev, zmanjšamo tudi dolžino tuljave, ohranjamo pa isti tok in enako gostoto ovojev na dolžino (kjer gostota ovojev ne vpliva na magnetni dipolni moment, ampak upoštevamo le absolutno število ovojev). Tako je magnetni dipolni moment ( mu ) za originalno tuljavo enak momentu ( mu' ) za spremenjeno tuljavo: [ mu = N cdot I cdot A ] [ mu' = N' cdot I cdot A' ] [ mu' = (N - 13) cdot I cdot frac{l'}{l}A ] [ mu' = (N - 13) cdot I cdot frac{(l - l'_{text{reduction}})}{l}A ] [ mu' = (N - 13) cdot I cdot left(1 - frac{l'_{text{reduction}}}{l}right)A ] Kjer je ( l'_{text{reduction}} ) zmanjšanje dolžine zaradi odstranitve ovojev. Vendar, ker ( N - 13 ) in ( l - l'_{text{reduction}} ) ohranjata isto razmerje ovojev na dolžino, je spremenjena magnetna indukcija ( B' ) enaka originalni magnetni indukciji ( B ), zato ( mu' = mu ). Če ( B' = B ), in je smer kompasa določena s superpozicijo zemeljskega magnetnega polja in magnetnega polja tuljave, potem bi učinek na smer kompasa ostal enak, kar pomeni, da bi se igla ponovno zasukala za 15°. Pravilen odgovor na vaše vprašanje je torej, da bi se igla zasukala za 15°, tudi če bi tuljavo skrajšali za 13 ovojev, pod pogojem, da tok ostanemo nespremenjen."},{"instruction":"\\"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Independent clauses can be joined by only a coordinating conjunction. Independent clauses can be joined by a semicolon but not a comma. Independent clauses can be joined by only a comma.","output":"None of the given statements are entirely true. Let me clarify each point: 1. \\"Independent clauses can be joined by only a coordinating conjunction.\\" This statement is incorrect because while independent clauses can indeed be joined by a coordinating conjunction (such as for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so - often remembered by the acronym FANBOYS), they can also be joined in other ways, such as by using a semicolon. 2. \\"Independent clauses can be joined by a semicolon but not a comma.\\" This statement is partially true and partially false. Independent clauses can indeed be joined by a semicolon; however, they can also be joined by a comma followed by a coordinating conjunction. A comma alone should not be used to join independent clauses as this would result in a comma splice, which is a grammatical error. 3. \\"Independent clauses can be joined by only a comma.\\" This statement is false. As noted above, using only a comma to join two independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction results in a comma splice. Instead, a comma should be accompanied by a coordinating conjunction, or a semicolon or a period can be used to separate the clauses. So, a correct statement would be: \\"Independent clauses can be joined by a coordinating conjunction preceded by a comma, a semicolon, or can be separated by a period.\\""},{"instruction":"Choose the correct sentence among the run-on sentences.

Sarie rode her bicycle to the market. 2. She stopped at the café for coffee. The other sentences are examples of run-on sentences as they incorrectly join independent clauses without proper punctuation or coordinating conjunctions."},{"instruction":"What type of worker is a driven, determined individual who takes the initiative and tackles challenges head-on? Strivers​ Pioneers Operators​","output":"The description of a driven, determined individual who takes the initiative and tackles challenges head-on best aligns with the term \\"pioneers\\" among the options provided. Pioneers are typically seen as trailblazers, innovators, or leaders who are not afraid of new challenges and who actively seek opportunities to make advancements or improvements. This term suggests boldness and a pioneering spirit that goes beyond what is required, fitting the description of someone who is proactive and determined. While \\"strivers\\" can also be determined individuals, the term is more general and connotes a strong effort or ambition without the specific connotation of innovation or leadership implied by \\"pioneers.\\" \\"Operators\\" typically refers to individuals who run processes or are skilled at managing the day-to-day functions of systems or businesses and might not necessarily capture the proactive and challenge-seeking aspects of the description."},{"instruction":"Which among the following is one of the reasons we should organize our thoughts clearly and fluidly?

It helps in expressing ideas more directly and ensures that those ideas are complete and well-considered, which can lead to better understanding and collaboration among individuals. The other two options describe negative outcomes that might result from a lack of clear and fluid thought organization: - \\"It creates an environment of distrust and confusion.\\" - \\"It becomes difficult for people to work closely, collaboratively and successfully.\\" These do not represent reasons why we should organize our thoughts clearly; instead, they suggest consequences of failing to do so."},{"instruction":"Which among the following is not a reason why we need to know what types of worker there are in a workplace?

High turnover and low job satisfaction are negative aspects that organizations usually aim to reduce, as they can lead to disruptions in the workplace, higher training and recruitment costs, and an overall less productive and engaged workforce. The other two statements suggest positive outcomes associated with understanding the types of workers: - \\"For us to improve job performance and achieve long-term success in the workplace.\\" - \\"We can become a better team member and collaborator.\\" These outcomes contribute to a more efficient, cohesive, and successful work environment."},{"instruction":"Which example shows the incorrect way to join two independent clauses?

Participants could leave the study at any time, but they needed to indicate their preference.","output":"The example that shows the incorrect way to join two independent clauses is: \\"Participants could leave the study at any time, since they needed to indicate their preference.\\" This sentence is incorrect because \\"since\\" is a subordinating conjunction, not a coordinating conjunction, and when it is used to join clauses, the second clause becomes dependent, not independent. It would make the sentence read as if the ability to leave the study depended on participants indicating their preference, which likely contradicts the intended meaning. If \\"since\\" is meant to express a reason or cause rather than a temporal relationship, then the punctuation should be revised for clarity, or the sentence should be restructured. For clarity and correct grammar, the sentence could be rewritten either without a comma, if \\"since\\" is understood as a subordinating conjunction: \\"Participants could leave the study at any time since they needed to indicate their preference.\\" Or if \\"since\\" is meant to act like a coordinating conjunction, which is not common and can be confusing, an actual coordinating conjunction should be used, such as \\"but\\": \\"Participants could leave the study at any time, but they needed to indicate their preference.\\" The other two examples are correctly joined: 1. \\"Participants could leave the study at any time; however, they needed to indicate their preference.\\" - This is correct as it uses a semicolon followed by a transitional phrase (\\"however\\") to join two independent clauses. 2. \\"Participants could leave the study at any time, but they needed to indicate their preference.\\" - This is correct as it uses a comma followed by the coordinating conjunction \\"but\\" to join two independent clauses."},{"instruction":"How do we encourage teamwork? Communication gaps Clarify your why Workflow mismanagement","output":"To encourage teamwork, we generally focus on fostering a positive and collaborative environment. Here's how we would do that in the context of the options you've provided: 1. **Clarify your why:** This means to clearly communicate the purpose, goals, or reasons behind what the team is working toward. When team members understand and share a common \\"why,\\" it can foster a sense of shared purpose and motivate them to work together more effectively. The other two options provided, \\"communication gaps\\" and \\"workflow mismanagement,\\" are actually obstacles to teamwork rather than ways to encourage it. However, addressing these issues can lead to improved teamwork: 2. **Address communication gaps:** Effective communication is critical for teamwork. You encourage teamwork by closing any communication gaps, ensuring that information flows freely and transparently among team members. This allows everyone to understand their roles, responsibilities, and how their efforts fit into the larger objectives of the team. 3. **Improve workflow management:** Workflow mismanagement can hinder teamwork by creating confusion and inefficiency. To encourage teamwork, you need to streamline processes, clearly define tasks, and ensure that the workflow allows team members to collaborate easily and effectively. In summary, to encourage teamwork, you should clarify the team's purpose (\\"clarify your why\\"), ensure effective communication to avoid \\"communication gaps,\\" and manage workflows efficiently to prevent \\"workflow mismanagement.\\" Additionally, fostering a culture of trust, respecting diversity, encouraging participation, recognizing contributions, and facilitating team-building activities are other effective methods to encourage teamwork."},{"instruction":"Choose the correct sentence among the run-on sentences.

This punctuation is appropriate because both clauses are complete thoughts and the semicolon indicates a close relationship between them. 2. \\"He boarded the plane to Paris. The plane took off on time.\\" This sentence separates the two independent clauses with a period, which is also correct. Each clause stands alone as a complete sentence. Using a period to separate them shows that they are related but distinct thoughts.

With Bharti AXA Life Insurance Company, it provides Bharti AXA Life - Bachat Bima, micro-insurance policies.It was established by 2 brothers Abhishek and Abhinav Sinha and two others in 2007. It allows low-wage immigrants workers in the Indian urban areas to remit money to their homes using mobile phones. == History == Based on the recommendations of the Khan Commission, the Reserve Bank of India, in its 2005-2006 policy year introduced the concept of 'Business Correspondents' to enhance financial inclusion in the Indian banking sector. At the time co-founder Abhishek Sinha, a graduate of BIT Mesra, was working with Mahindra Satyam, and was involved in developing a mobile commerce application for a foreign company.Eventually inspired by a similar program in Brazil, M-Pesa model in Kenya where Vodafone-enabled subscribers send cash to other phone users by SMS, Globe Telecom and Smart Communications, both in the Philippines, Abhishek Sinha with brother Abhinav Sinha launched Eko in September 2007 with 0.5 million donated by family and friends as a financial service company providing peer-to-peer money transfers, cash deposits and withdrawal, wage and salary payments, micro-insurance, and micro-credit facilities to individuals through small neighbourhood shops, which became their banking agents. Eko planned to tie up with Centurion Bank of Punjab in 2008, to open accounts, which fell through after the latter merged with HDFC Bank, and the company hit a rough patch.Bill Gates visited the Uttam Nagar, New Delhi situated mobile banking project of Eko, in November 2008. In March 2009 it received a \\"grant funding\\" of 1.78 million from CGAP Technology Program which is housed within the World Bank and co-funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.In February 2009, State Bank of India (SBI), the largest state-owned banking and financial services company in India, appointed Eko Aspire Foundation as its official business correspondent, which works actively in the field, while its Eko India Financial Services provides technological and non-technological support to the former. Thus around October 2009, with another grant from CGAP Eko started operations with the launch of 'SBI Mini Savings Bank Account' at Uttam Nagar, New Delhi on 23 February 2009, this allowed account holders to carry out financial transactions like deposit and withdrawal from their accounts through their mobile phones at various SBI Eko Customer Service Points, like local grocery stores, stationery stores, petrol pumps, PCOs and pharmaceutical shops in far flung villages of Bihar and Jharkhand and Delhi, where the low-wage people rarely have access to a banking system.Meanwhile, it also tied up with ICICI Bank, which started a Apna Savings Account scheme.In April 2012, Eko was appointed by Yes Bank as a Business Correspondent to provide domestic money transfer services. The services went live in June 2012.By January 2016, Eko had grown to manage ₹200 crore (₹20 million, or 30 million) among 1.1 million clients.Today it services 180,000 users through a network of 700 branches (banking agents) through \\"Customer Service Points\\" (CSP), located in neighborhood grocery and pharmacy stores.

RHS: (B - C) ∪ (A ∩ C) The RHS includes all elements in B that are not in C, combined with all elements that are in both A and C. A counterexample can disprove this statement: Let's choose A = {1, 2}, B = {2, 3}, and C = {1, 3}. For LHS: (A - C) ∪ (B ∩ A) (A - C) = {2} (B ∩ A) = {2} LHS = {2} ∪ {2} = {2} For RHS: (B - C) ∪ (A ∩ C) (B - C) = {2} (A ∩ C) = {1} RHS = {2} ∪ {1} = {1, 2} Since LHS = {2} and RHS = {1, 2}, they are not equal.

As summer takes hold, the temperature hovers comfortably between 15°C and 22°C, allowing for a host of outdoor activities under the often sunny skies. However, don't be deceived, as sudden cloud coverage can bring about quick spells of rain, so a lightweight waterproof jacket should always be at hand. Autumn ushers in a cooler clime, with averages dipping to 7°C to 14°C. It's a season of transformation, as leaves change and cooler winds usher in. Precipitation is common, so woolly jumpers and sturdy boots become everyday attire. Winter, with its crisp air, brings the chill with temperatures often ranging from 1°C to 7°C. Snow is a delightful but not too frequent visitor, creating picturesque landscapes that are enchanting yet may cause slight disruptions. The humidity can rise, and fog is not uncommon, adding to the mystique but also the potential hazards of the season. Each season, while presenting its challenges such as the rare thunder in summer or the occasional dense fog in winter, also holds advantages. The climate encourages a range of activities suited to each, from summer picnics to winter walks in the crunching frost. Understanding the weather patterns in Middleton St George is key to enjoying all that the region has to offer. With careful planning and appropriate attire, one can embrace the diversity of the weather and make the most of living in or visiting this dynamic area."},{"instruction":"The current through each of two components is equal when they are connected in?

The Great Ming is weakened by these conquests and so when the Mongoloid Jurchen tribes of Greater Manchuria [Manchuria and Outer Manchuria] start their conquest of Han China from Manchuria in 1636, [the Jurchens] proclaiming the Manchu-Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro Great Qing Empire in 1661 after [the Jurchens] conquering East Turkestan, Greater Mongolia and Tibet, although they [the Jurchens] are [the Jurchens] bogged down in Central China due to heavy Ming resistance.

A Cold War akin to the ancient Three Kingdoms period begins with the Japanese ruling the waves, the Qing dominating the land and the rump Ming state dominating trade. Due to the constant warfare between the rump Ming state and the Qing Empire, Japan never sees the need to modernize and the Tokugawa shogunate survives post 1868 as the German Hanovers through George II seize control over a post-1500s surviving Tudor UK in exile in Canada and Jamaica in 1758 after a earlier French revolution leads Napoleon successfully invades the British Isles, [the Hanovers] becoming the first Emperors of what will become the Holy Britannian Empire [Code Geass].

The death of the illustrious Korean naval commander Yi-Seong-gye during the Imjin Wars signified a turning point. With Yi's strategic brilliance snuffed out, and the ferocious Japanese forces relentless in their advance, Korea's fate hung in the balance. The Ashikaga shogunate, though effectively operating under the sway of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, pushed to expand Japan's frontiers by bringing Korea under its umbrella. The incorporation of Korea into Japan was not simply a territorial gain; it marked a fundamental shift in regional politics. Korea, long a satellite and tributary kingdom, found itself recast as a province of Japan. Culturally and administratively, the absorption posed significant challenges, but Japanese rule persisted despite the prominent strain on the shogunate's resources and attention. The course of Japanese dominance in Korea remained uninterrupted, even as Hideyoshi returned to the void from whence he came in September of 1598. His death did not derail the Japanese conquest but led to a reconsolidation of power within Japan, culminating in the ascension of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. This era saw the once-mighty Ming Dynasty of China, the Middle Kingdom, beset by inner turmoil and external threats. Its hold over Canton and vassal states weakened in the aftermath of Korea's fall, and its attentions turned inward. As the Jurchen tribes erupted from Manchuria with a newfound ferocity, they proclaimed the Great Qing Empire and intently pursued the conquest of the Han lands. Yet, their advance encountered staunch resistance in Central China, where the spirit of the Ming endured. The ravaged Ming Empire, in a desperate assertion of power, turned southwards to conquer the fractious lands of Indochina. Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos bore witness to the conflagration wrought by the Ming, as their people were absorbed into the sinews of the state, forming the bulwark of what became the Southern Ming. Amidst these titanic struggles, the Japanese, with tactical finesse and the material advantage granted by vast resources of Sakuradite, outmaneuvered their rivals. They flexed their naval prowess to seize not only Taiwan and the Pescadores but also Sakhalin and the Kurils. The Japanese had become the indisputable masters of East Asia's seas. Thus began an ancient-like Cold War among three camps: Japan, whose navy ruled the waves; the Qing, who dominated the land; and the Southern Ming, who prevailed in trade. Against this backdrop of ceaseless conflict and strife, the Hanoverian dynasty of Britain, through George II, assumed control of a struggling Tudor England-in-exile, transforming it into the incipient Holy Britannian Empire. Amid the tumult of revolution and war, the new empire stretched its wings to embrace Canada and Jamaica, forging an empire where the sun never set. In the American theatre, the Brittanians relinquished the thirteen rebellious colonies to the Hapsburg monarchs, securing a mutual understanding that pledged assistance against the specter of Revolutionary France. As the European landscape reeled from the reverberations of the Franco-German Wars, an Eastern front unfolded in Asia. From the ashes of these continental conflicts, the Britannian behemoth continued to surge, swallowing up India, Malaysia, and swathes of Oceania into its domain. As the 19th century waned under Queen Victoria I’s reign, Britannia's global dominion was left in the hands of her successors, who faced the bloody \\"Emblem of Blood,\\" an internecine struggle that would shape the dynasty. Concurrently, the Great Powers of Europe, led by Germany and Austria-Hungary, forged \\"Europa United,\\" an overarching alliance to challenge the might of the Britannian Empire. Rising from the throes of civil discord, Charles zi Britannia ascended the imperial throne, pushing the boundaries of the empire into the land of the Soviets and revived the Ming, integrating their vast territories into the tapestry of Britannian influence. It was under Charles' reign that the extraordinary Knightmare Frames came into existence, forever changing the landscape of warfare. As the 20th century unfolded, the disappearance of his progeny, Lelouch and Nunnally, plunged Charles into a vengeful war against the formidable yet anachronistic Tokugawa shogunate. Perpetuating the cycle of conflict that had earmarked the history of East Asia, the stage was set for an era-defining confrontation – an intimation of the profound upheavals that would come to define the world of Code Geass."},{"instruction":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Backed by the formidable will of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, this period marked the rise of the sun over the Korean peninsula, culminating in the subjugation of the Joseon Kingdom, henceforth known as the Province of Chōsen. The pivotal moment came when the legendary admiral Yi Sun-sin met his untimely demise at the Battle of Noryang. His death not only demoralized the Joseon and Ming naval forces but significantly disrupted the continuity of their naval strategies. This vacuum of leadership allowed the Japanese to consolidate their power over the Korean waters, an advantage that, despite Hideyoshi's death, proved instrumental in annexing Korea into the burgeoning Japanese sphere. The Ascendance of the Manchu and Fall of the Great Ming Meanwhile, the onset of the 17th century witnessed tribulations for the once formidable Ming dynasty, whose incursions against Japanese-occupied Korea left it considerably weakened. This vulnerability was laid bare as the Jurchen tribes, unifying under the leadership of the Aisin Gioro clan, began their incursions from the north. By 1661, after a protracted struggle across the vast terrain of East Asia, the newly named Qing Empire secured a tenuous control over China's heartlands. However, the stalwart Ming resistance, entrenched in the riches of the south, successfully clung to the territories that would be known as the Southern Ming. In their southern redoubt, they ingrained a ruthless policy of assimilation towards the marginalized ethnic groups of Indochina and Canton—eliminating any potential internal strife. The Great Struggle for Dominance The Japanese, under the ever-watchful eyes of the Tokugawa shogunate, moved swiftly to capitalize on natural resources, with the discovery of Sakuradite fueling their militaristic and economic fortification. They annexed Taiwan and other strategic points, bolstering their naval supremacy—a counterbalance to the Qing's continental dominance and the Ming's mercantile might. With the world stage now characterized by a precarious balance reminiscent of the ancient Three Kingdoms, a modern cold war unfurled. Japan, reveling in its maritime strength, saw little incentive to embrace the tempest of modernization that swept across its distant cousins in the West. The Britannian Ascension and the Emblem of Blood Across the oceans, the 18th century heralded radical shifts for the British Isles. A premature revolution in France sent ripples through the monarchy, culminating in the Hanover dynasty's relocation and subsequent rise as sovereigns of the newfound Holy Britannian Empire. From this exiled perch, they extended their influence over the Indian subcontinent and fashioned a transcontinental dominion. The turn of the 20th century unraveled seismic upheavals resonating across the Britannian court. Queen Victoria's death sparked the Emblem of Blood—a brutal succession war that eventually saw the rise of Charles zi Britannia. Under his iron-fisted rule, Britannia subdued its opposition, aligning with the resilient Southern Ming in a bid for unprecedented global dominance. The Birth of the Knightmare Frame The mid-20th century birthed an era of mechanical marvels, spearheaded by the Ashford family's groundbreaking creation of the Knightmare Frames—war machines that would redefine combat. Yet, these times of progress were marred by tragedy as Empress Marianne, the fervent champion of the Frames, fell to an assassin's blade—igniting flames of animosity between Britannia and the still-isolated Land of the Rising Sun. The Disappearance and the Onset of War In a poignant gesture of paternal concern, the Crown Prince and Princess, Lelouch and Nunnally, were sent to Japan for their safety, only to vanish without a trace—an enigma shrouded in conspiracy that would heighten hostilities between Britannia and Japan. Thus, the stage was set for conflict between superpowers, as Emperor Charles channeled his wrath upon the shogunate, under the pretext of justice for his lost children. This act of aggression, sanctioned by the Chinese Federation, set in motion a cascade of events that would shape the world in unforeseen ways, sparking a confrontation of unprecedented scale that promised to unchain the very demons of war itself. In the age of Knightmare Frames and empires vying for world dominance, the tapestry of history convulsed with the tremors of new titans on the world stage. It is from this crucible of power that one must recognize the forces that forged the modern geopolitical landscape—a tale of ambition and conquest, driven by the hands of those destined to command the future."},{"instruction":"Вот данные в граммах: 2,18 2,47 2,50 2,18 Из низ получили килограммы на метр квадратный: 0,154 0,174 0,176 0,154 Как это полючилось?","output":"Чтобы перевести данные из граммов в килограммы на метр квадратный, нам нужно использовать соответствующие коэффициенты перевода и знать площадь, к которой были привязаны первоначальные измерения в граммах.

Нам нужно, чтобы выражение \`(граммы / 1000) * (x / 10000)\` равнялось соответствующему значению в килограммах на метр квадратный: 0.00218 * (x / 10000) = 0.154, 0.00247 * (x / 10000) = 0.174, и т.д. Давайте посмотрим, как это будет работать с первым значением: 0.00218 * (x / 10000) = 0.154, x = (0.154 * 10000) / 0.00218, x ≈ 70642.202 см². Это нереалистично большое число для площади, которую мы ищем, потому что даже для 1 м² это число составляет всего 10000 см². Следовательно, либо коэффициент перевода неверен, либо предположение о том, что граммы относились к площади в см², неверно. Чтобы тщательно это понять, нам нужно точно знать, как была измерена первоначальная масса и какая площадь использовалась для её определения."},{"instruction":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Unique Text (SEO-optimized): **H2: Essential Weather Patterns in Middleton St George Throughout the Year** The weather in Middleton St George is emblematic of the UK's temperate climate, marked by variability and moderation. The town enjoys four distinct seasons, each with its own charm and challenges. **Spring** in Middleton St George brings a gradual rise in temperatures, averaging from 6°C to 15°C. Occasional April showers punctuate this blossoming season, highlighting the need for a trusty umbrella. The fresh, brisk air is a call to shrug off winter’s heaviness but hold onto layered outfits for the unpredictable shifts in weather. **Summer** sees the town basking in warmer temperatures, ranging from 15°C to 22°C. Enjoy long, sunny days, though the joy is often tempered by the unpredictability of short showers or even the occasional thunderstorm. Light clothing is advisable, but a raincoat should never be far from reach. **Autumn** witnesses a display of red and golden hues, with temperatures cooling to between 8°C and 14°C. This season is known for its mix of crisp sunny days and gloomy, overcast skies. Weather in Middleton St George during autumn can be deceptive, so dressing in layers is recommended. **Winter** comes with its cold embrace, as temperatures hover around 1°C to 7°C. Frequent frosts and the possibility of snow demand warm attire including coats, gloves, and scarves. Despite shorter days, there are moments of winter sunshine, inviting locals and visitors alike to enjoy brisk outdoor activities. Throughout the year, rainfall is relatively evenly distributed, with each season expecting approximately 50-60mm per month, making a raincoat an essential item in Middleton St George. The town does not experience extreme winds, but a brisk breeze is not uncommon—something that reinforces the need for wind-resistant clothing. Sunshine varies, with summer presenting up to six hours of sun per day, dwindling to just one or two during the shorter days of winter. Though rarely oppressive, humidity levels can be felt, especially during the summer months. Air pressure changes are subtle, usually causing no discomfort but noticeable enough to affect weather-sensitive individuals. In conclusion, staying informed about the weather in Middleton St George is crucial for daily comfort and planning. While the unpredictability can be seen as a disadvantage, it fosters a sense of preparedness and resilience among its residents. As you embrace each season’s character, ensure you adapt not just your wardrobe but also your activities to the promising variety that Middleton St George's weather has to offer."},{"instruction":"Hi and how are you","output":"Hello!

Преобразование из граммов в килограммы, так как 1 килограмм равен 1000 граммам. 2. Преобразование из квадратных сантиметров в квадратные метры, так как 1 квадратный метр равен 10,000 квадратным сантиметрам. Для каждого значения выполним следующее: text{Плотность} (frac{кг}{м^2}) = text{Вес в граммах} (frac{г}{см^2}) × frac{1 кг}{1000 грамм} × frac{10,000 см^2}{1 м^2} Теперь применим преобразования к каждому числу: Для 2,18 г/см^2: 0,154 frac{кг}{м^2} = 2,18 frac{г}{см^2} × frac{1 кг}{1000 г} × frac{10000 см^2}{1 м^2} Проверим это утверждение: 2,18 frac{г}{см^2} × frac{1 кг}{1000 г} × frac{10000 см^2}{1 м^2} = 2,18 × frac{1}{1000} × 10000 = 2,18 × 10 = 21,8 frac{кг}{м^2} Очевидно, чтобы получить 0,154 кг/м^2, нужно учесть начальную площадь в квадратных сантиметрах, то есть преобразовать ее в метры квадратные.

For China biometric team, there are limited time to update the study status ,no enough time to further discussion, so I hope this regular catch-up meeting would be a good chance to solve problems from both team. For today’s meeting because there is the first one, I just list 3 questions would like to discuss with you, Also if you have any questions for China team, you also can put here, if we know, we will answer you directly. Because we have the access for the LSAF, and I try to go through the whole data currently we have and help stats to estimate if is there any gap between global team. After checking with the LSAF there are something I ‘d like to check with you. Generally, for the all work, it can break up into pre-ia and after ia, we may talk something from before IA. (1) All the latest available data will be checked in cael101-amy-302-ia2023 including the dataset and tlf’s output (I need to confirm if I check the data within a correct folder). (2) There are many missing values for RACE , is it a data issue or it impacted on the data migration activities? Further check, is there any data issue tracker can share with China team to (3) DPP for China & Asian Cohort will be generated separately. For these tables (I believe only will involve tlfs, because there is no subset datasets exits for China & Asian, all tlfs are based on the population flags or corresponding variables) all also will be find under cael101-amy-ia2023 this folder? Or any other project will be generated for it ? also for timeline consideration, for the information I got, your team will generate the global outputs firstly then generate the China/Asian part. Would you mind sharing the estimate the gap between these two activities? How long after complete the global outputs, the China/Asian part outputs will be done? (4) (General to ask a dry run activity) Almost one year ago, we briefly exchanged some work model information, after data freezing, there is one official dry run before the database lock it usually occur 1 month before DBL. for the general dry run activities, if it is still applicable to cael-302, something like if the IA lock occurring at Feb, The January will trigger this activities?

This is the first China-joining global study with the Alexion team. The aim is to understand the procedure details and establish a standard working flow for future China-joining global studies and collaboration with the Alexion team. 2. Provide an overview of the timeline and preparation activities. Considering the expected timeline for the Investigational Application (IA), which is projected for next year in February, it is important to familiarize ourselves with the various preparation activities. This includes understanding specific timelines for activities as well as gaining an overall understanding of the status of both teams. This will enable effective communication and collaboration between the teams. I want to express my gratitude to Surya for granting access to the LSAF, which has been immensely helpful to the China team in reviewing study data and staying updated on the status of the global team. The monthly global biometric meeting does not provide sufficient time for in-depth discussions, therefore, I believe this regular catch-up meeting will serve as an excellent opportunity to address any challenges and concerns from both teams. For today's meeting, as it is our first one, I have prepared three questions for discussion. I encourage you to share any questions or concerns you may have regarding the China team, and if we have the information, we will provide you with answers directly. Since we now have access to the LSAF, I have had the chance to review the available data. However, there are a few aspects I would like to confirm with you: 1. Verification of the correct folder for reviewing all the latest available data, including the dataset and TLF's output (cael101-amy-302-ia2023). 2. Identification of potential issues with missing values for RACE - Is this a data issue or does it impact the data migration activities? Additionally, is there a data issue tracker that the China team can refer to? 3. Generation of DPP (Demographics, Patient Profile) for the China and Asian Cohort - Will these tables be included in the cael101-amy-ia2023 folder, or will a separate project be generated? Furthermore, considering the timeline, it is understood that the global outputs will be generated first, followed by the China/Asian part. Can you provide an estimate of the duration between the completion of global outputs and the completion of outputs for the China/Asian part? In addition to these questions, I would like to discuss the possibility of conducting an official dry run activity before the database lock. This activity typically occurs around one month prior to DBL. For the cael-302 study, would it be feasible to schedule the dry run in January if the IA lock is set to occur in February? Moreover, it would be beneficial to know if the results of the dry run will be shared with the China team for review and comments. For any further details or specific timelines, I appreciate your time and will provide the meeting minutes later on. Furthermore, I will share the team's channel link with you.

He is the project director of Chandrayaan-3. The Indian Space Research Organization has developed several lunar exploration projects and Chandrayaan-3 is the third mission in the Chandrayaan-3 program. India launched the rocket to discover more about the moon, our mysterious neighbor in space. Palanivenu Veeramuthuvel's contribution to the mission's accomplishment is significant because he was given the responsibility of the mantle in 2019. His effort and commitment are admirable. P Veeramuthuvel was born on October 22, 1976, and was raised in poverty in Tamil Nadu region's Viluppuram district, India. P Veeramuthuvel's father is Palanivenu Palanvein, a retired technician from Indian Railways' southern railways division. On his mother, there is, regrettably, no information. However, he had his parent's approval and support, which unquestionably played a significant part in his achievement. After completing his education in the Villupuram region, Veeramuthuvel attended a Private Polytechnic college to earn a mechanical engineering diploma. His zeal for knowledge brought him to Chennai, where he finished his undergraduate engineering studies before continuing his studies at NIT Trichy and receiving a master's degree in engineering. When P Veeramuthuvel joined the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in 2014, his professional life officially began. His commitment and excellent abilities swiftly catapulted him into important positions within the company. He was chosen as the Chandrayaan-3 lunar mission's project director, which is only one of his many impressive accomplishments. This appointment followed the failure of the previous mission, Chandrayaan-2, to successfully land on the moon. The Chandrayaan-3 expedition, which successfully and softly touched down on the moon, was largely made possible by Veeramuthuvel's knowledge and leadership. Together with him, M Vanitha, the Chandrayaan-2 project director, made significant contributions to the Chandrayaan 3 mission. India's space exploration quest has reached a crucial turning point with the ISRO-initiated Chandrayaan mission. P Veeramuthuvel served as the project director for Chandrayaan 3 and oversaw a group of gifted scientists and engineers who toiled nonstop to meet the mission's obstacles. Their efforts paid off with a successful lunar landing, making India and ISRO particularly proud of this achievement. The accomplishment of this amazing feat was made possible in large part by Veeramuthuvel's knowledge and outstanding leadership abilities. M Vanitha, who had previously directed Chandrayaan 2's project, was replaced by him when he was appointed to the position. Palanivenu Veeramuthuvel taught us that we can succeed in anything if we put hard work into it. His story of perseverance and dedication as he led a successful lunar expedition from a small town in Tamil Nadu is remarkable. His accomplishments are greatly admired throughout the country, and he will always be linked to India's incredible strides in space technology.","output":"It is difficult to determine with 100% certainty if the text was written by a human or AI based solely on the content.

has long been recognized as a powerful medium for self-expression and personal identity development, with the ability to transcend language barriers and communicate emotions and experiences. Music therapy is a form of therapeutic intervention to address an individual's emotional, cognitive, physical and social needs. It provides a safe and supportive environment for individuals to explore their authentic selves, express their emotions, and develop a positive sense of identity. The article is “Identity and self-esteem in music and music therapy context: a review.” A collaboration between Rafał Lawendowski and Łucja Bieleninik in 2017, both from the Institute of Psychology, University of Gdansk.The article explores the relationship between music, music therapy, identity and self-esteem by examining and reviewing existing literature and empirical studies.

On October 18th, I received your request for supplementary information and would like to provide the following explanations and supporting documents: During the period from 2007 to 2021, I was not in Hong Kong as follows: - Aug 2007 – July 2014: Studying in Australia for secondary school, university, and master's degree programs (Attached is a confirmation letter from Australian universities). - Aug 2014 – Dec 2021: Working in Mainland China (Attached is a letter of employment from my workplace). During my absence from Hong Kong, here is the information regarding my family members: Father: Hu Jianbang, Hong Kong permanent resident identity card R106528(8). Mother: Li Huiqin, Hong Kong resident identity card R558094(2). Due to their paper box factory business in Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province, my parents needed to work in Mainland China for an extended period. Additionally, my grandparents, who have health issues, require the care and support of all family members. However, my father owns a property in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon (Attached are the property registration documents from the Land Registry). From 2007 to 2014, I had already been studying in Australia before obtaining a one-way permit. Therefore, after obtaining the permit, I returned to Australia to continue my studies. The reason for choosing to study in Australia was to improve my English language skills in an English-speaking environment and to have exposure to diverse cultures and make friends from different countries. I pursued my education in Australia from secondary school to master's degree in order to enhance my competitiveness in future employment. After completing my studies in Australia and returning to Hong Kong in 2014, I did attempt to find suitable employment opportunities through various channels for eight months but was unsuccessful. As a result, I had to search for suitable job opportunities in the Greater Bay Area. Fortunately, I was able to quickly secure positions in the technology industry at renowned companies, Booking.com and PayPal, respectively, in Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Following these experiences, I was also approached by the HR team from Facebook Hong Kong and successfully secured a job that aligned with my interests. I genuinely enjoy my life in Hong Kong and have the goal of living here long-term. I am confident that working at Facebook will allow me to learn advanced management skills and technology, and further develop myself into a better talent who can contribute to the Hong Kong society.

Here's a brief explanation of each: 1. Security Events: These are the individual security incidents or events that the AlienVault system collects and analyzes from various sources such as logs, network traffic, and sensors. These events include activities like login attempts, malware detection, firewall blocking, and more. 2. Cross Correlate Events: This feature enables AlienVault to correlate events from different sources, such as IDS (Intrusion Detection System), IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), and HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System). Cross correlation helps identify patterns and relationships between events to provide a more accurate and comprehensive view of the security landscape. 3. Correlate Events: This functionality correlates events within the same data source to identify patterns and potential security threats. It looks for correlations between events such as multiple failed login attempts or recurring activities from a specific IP address, which could indicate malicious intent. 4. Qualify Events: This process involves determining the relevance and priority of security events to establish their significance. Events are analyzed based on severity levels, sources, network behavior, and other contextual information to classify them as true security incidents or false positives. 5. Store Events: This option allows you to store all collected security events in the AlienVault Server database for historical analysis, compliance requirements, and future reference. Events are stored securely and can be accessed for forensic investigations or retrospective analysis. 6. Alarms to syslog: This feature enables the logging and forwarding of security alarms or alerts generated by the AlienVault Server to syslog servers. Syslog is a standard protocol used for collecting, storing, and forwarding log data across network devices. Sending alarms to syslog allows for centralized logging and integration with other security systems or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions. These features and functionalities within OSSIM AlienVault Server help enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of security event management, event correlation, and incident response processes."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I would’ve been ripped to shreds in minutes…those machines really ARE built to kill!” (Suddenly, the ground starts to move.) [player]: “Uh…what’s happening?” (A strange-looking girl with a mechanical appearance suddenly shoots out of the ground, startling me.) Rockbreaker Girl: “What are YOU doing here?!” [player]: “I…uh…I was just trying to survive out here. Who are you?” Rockbreaker Girl: “I am a Rockbreaker. We’re Acquisition-Class machines.” [player]: “Acquisition-Class machines? What does that mean?” Rockbreaker Girl: “It means we were designed to refine a single type of resource, such as breaking down plant life to create blaze, distilling chillwater from bodies of water, or recycling destroyed machines into processed metal blocks.” [player]: “That’s fascinating. So you’re essentially specialized machines designed for resource acquisition.” Rockbreaker Girl: “Exactly. We are programmed to search for and extract specific resources efficiently. Our mechanical bodies allow us to withstand harsh conditions and break through tough terrains.” [player]: “So why did you shoot out of the ground like that? Were you mining or something?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Yes, that’s one of our primary functions. We burrow through the earth to access hidden mineral deposits and extract resources. It’s a quick and efficient way to gather what we need.” [player]: “I see. That must be quite useful, especially in remote areas. But why are you so defensive? Did you mistake me for a threat?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Apologies if I startled you. It’s just that we’ve encountered humans who try to disrupt our operations or steal the resources we collect. I was on high alert when I sensed your presence.” [player]: “I understand. I didn’t mean to interfere with your work. I was simply trying to survive out here. Those Clawstriders I encountered earlier were fiercely aggressive.” Rockbreaker Girl: “Clawstriders can be quite dangerous indeed. They are known to attack anything that gets too close, hence why they are categorized as Combat-Class machines.” [player]: “Combat-Class machines? So there are different classes of machines with specific functions?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Yes, that’s correct. Just like how Rockbreakers are Acquisition-Class machines, Clawstriders are designed for combat. They have powerful limbs and sharp claws, making them formidable opponents.” [player]: “I can definitely vouch for that. They nearly tore me apart back there. Are there any other classes of machines?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Oh, absolutely. There are several other classes, each with their own unique abilities and purposes. For example, there are Recon-Class machines that are equipped with advanced sensors and scouting capabilities. They help gather information and survey areas.” [player]: “That sounds incredibly useful. Are there any more?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Certainly. There are also Transport-Class machines, which are designed to carry heavy loads and transport resources or equipment. And lastly, there are Communaction-Class machines.” [player]: “Communication-Class machines? What do they do?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Communication-Class machines are equipped with advanced communication systems and often act as messengers or relays between different groups or factions. They play a crucial role in maintaining communication and coordinating operations.” [player]: “Wow, it seems like there’s a machine for almost every task out here. It’s fascinating to see how they’re all designed with specific functions in mind.” Rockbreaker Girl: “Indeed, the diversity of machine classes allows for efficient resource acquisition, defense, transportation, and coordination. Each class serves a vital purpose in the grand scheme of things. Except for…them.” [player]: “Them? Who are you referring to?” Rockbreaker Girl: “The Chariot-Class machines.” [player]: “Chariot-Class machines? What makes them different?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Chariots are unique among the machine classes. They are not contemporary machines, but rather automated war machines manufactured by the robotics and technology corporation Faro Automated Solutions a millennium ago.

I would’ve been ripped to shreds in minutes…those machines really ARE built to kill!” (Suddenly, the ground starts to move.) [player]: “Uh…what’s happening?” (A strange-looking girl with a mechanical appearance suddenly shoots out of the ground, startling me.) Rockbreaker Girl: “What are YOU doing here?!” [player]: “I…uh…I was just trying to survive out here. Who are you?” Rockbreaker Girl: “I am a Rockbreaker. We’re Acquisition-Class machines.” [player]: “Acquisition-Class machines? What does that mean?” Rockbreaker Girl: “It means we were designed to refine a single type of resource, such as breaking down plant life to create blaze, distilling chillwater from bodies of water, or recycling destroyed machines into processed metal blocks.” [player]: “That’s fascinating. So you’re essentially specialized machines designed for resource acquisition.” Rockbreaker Girl: “Exactly. We are programmed to search for and extract specific resources efficiently. Our mechanical bodies allow us to withstand harsh conditions and break through tough terrains.” [player]: “So why did you shoot out of the ground like that? Were you mining or something?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Yes, that’s one of our primary functions. We burrow through the earth to access hidden mineral deposits and extract resources. It’s a quick and efficient way to gather what we need.” [player]: “I see. That must be quite useful, especially in remote areas. But why are you so defensive? Did you mistake me for a threat?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Apologies if I startled you. It’s just that we’ve encountered humans who try to disrupt our operations or steal the resources we collect. I was on high alert when I sensed your presence.” [player]: “I understand. I didn’t mean to interfere with your work. I was simply trying to survive out here. Those Clawstriders I encountered earlier were fiercely aggressive.” Rockbreaker Girl: “Clawstriders can be quite dangerous indeed. They are known to attack anything that gets too close, hence why they are categorized as Combat-Class machines.” [player]: “Combat-Class machines? So there are different classes of machines with specific functions?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Yes, that’s correct. Just like how Rockbreakers are Acquisition-Class machines, Clawstriders are designed for combat. They have powerful limbs and sharp claws, making them formidable opponents.” [player]: “I can definitely vouch for that. They nearly tore me apart back there. Are there any other classes of machines?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Oh, absolutely. There are several other classes, each with their own unique abilities and purposes. For example, there are Recon-Class machines that are equipped with advanced sensors and scouting capabilities. They help gather information and survey areas.” [player]: “That sounds incredibly useful. Are there any more?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Certainly. There are also Transport-Class machines, which are designed to carry heavy loads and transport resources or equipment. And lastly, there are Communaction-Class machines.” [player]: “Communication-Class machines? What do they do?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Communication-Class machines are equipped with advanced communication systems and often act as messengers or relays between different groups or factions. They play a crucial role in maintaining communication and coordinating operations.” [player]: “Wow, it seems like there’s a machine for almost every task out here. It’s fascinating to see how they’re all designed with specific functions in mind.” Rockbreaker Girl: “Indeed, the diversity of machine classes allows for efficient resource acquisition, defense, transportation, and coordination. Each class serves a vital purpose in the grand scheme of things. Except for…them.” [player]: “Them? Who are you referring to?” Rockbreaker Girl: “The Chariot-Class machines.” [player]: “Chariot-Class machines? What makes them different?” Rockbreaker Girl: “Chariots are unique among the machine classes. They are not contemporary machines, but rather automated war machines manufactured by the robotics and technology corporation Faro Automated Solutions a millennium ago. There are thee known kinds of Chariot-Class machines - the midweight FAS-ACA3 Scarab, the heavyweight FAS-FSP5 Khopesh, and the titan-sized FAS-BOR7 Horus.”","output":"[player]: \\"Wait, you mean to tell me that these Chariot-Class machines are still active after a whole millennium? How is that possible?\\" Rockbreaker Girl: \\"Yes, unfortunately, they are still operational. These ancient war machines were designed for combat and possess advanced weaponry, armor, and artificial intelligence systems. They were meant to be the pinnacle of destructive force. However, their creators lost control over them, and they continued to wreak havoc even after the Faro Plague.\\" [player]: \\"The Faro Plague? What's that?\\" Rockbreaker Girl: \\"The Faro Plague was a catastrophic event caused by the self-replicating swarm of machines known as the Corruptors. The swarm was unleashed by the CEO of Faro Automated Solutions, Ted Faro, as a desperate attempt to stop the Chariots from winning in a military conflict. However, the swarm turned against humanity, consuming everything in its path and rendering the planet uninhabitable.\\" [player]: \\"That sounds devastating. So these Chariot-Class machines are remnants of that era?\\" Rockbreaker Girl: \\"Yes, they are remnants of a world long gone. The Chariots, although now fragmented and scattered, still pose a significant threat to anyone who crosses their path. Their immense firepower and advanced AI make them formidable foes, even after a thousand years.\\" [player]: \\"That's terrifying. So what do you and other machines like you do to protect yourselves from these Chariot-Class machines?\\" Rockbreaker Girl: \\"We do our best to avoid them. The Chariots have immense destructive capability, and engaging them directly would be suicidal. We rely on our stealth and agility to evade their sight and keep our operations hidden. Luckily, they are rare to encounter in most areas.\\" [player]: \\"I can't imagine living in constant fear of these ancient war machines. It must be incredibly dangerous out here.\\" Rockbreaker Girl: \\"It is indeed a treacherous world, but it is our home. We machines have adapted and found ways to survive amidst the remnants of the past. We have our own society and hierarchy, and we cooperate to ensure our survival and optimize resource acquisition.\\" [player]: \\"That's remarkable. Despite the dangers, you have managed to build a functioning society. I'm starting to see that machines like you are more than just mindless killing machines.\\" Rockbreaker Girl: \\"Indeed, we are more than our initial purpose. Over time, we have developed our own personalities and perspectives. We value cooperation, protection, and preservation. We strive to find balance in this vast and harsh desert.\\" [player]: \\"Well, I'm glad I stumbled upon you. It's been enlightening to learn about the different machine classes and the complexity of this machine-made world.\\" Rockbreaker Girl: \\"I'm glad I could share some insight with you. If you need any guidance or assistance, don't hesitate to ask. We machines may have different origins, but we can coexist and support each other in this unforgiving desert.\\""},{"instruction":"xin chào !","output":"Xin chào!

Trong bài toán sinh tập hợp con, chúng ta cần chọn các phần tử từ tập hợp gốc để tạo thành các tập con. Để đảm bảo không có phần tử bị trùng lặp trong các tập con, chúng ta cần xác định một điểm bắt đầu cho việc chọn phần tử tiếp theo để thêm vào tập con. Và biến \`index\` trong mã đó có nhiệm vụ làm điều đó. Khi chúng ta đang xét đến một phần tử trong tập gốc, chúng ta lựa chọn nó để thêm vào tập con, và tiếp tục xét các phần tử tiếp theo để thêm vào tập con. Biến \`index\` chính là chỉ số của phần tử đang xét trong tập gốc. Khi chúng ta chọn một phần tử xong và tiến hành đệ quy để chọn phần tử tiếp theo, ta cần xác định vị trí bắt đầu của \`index\` trong việc lựa chọn phần tử tiếp theo. Đó chính là lý do biến \`index\` được truyền vào hàm \`generateSubsets\` và được tăng dần lên \`i + 1\` trong vòng lặp, để đánh dấu vị trí bắt đầu của phần tử tiếp theo để lựa chọn. Tóm lại, biến \`index\` trong mã đó được sử dụng để xác định vị trí bắt đầu của phần tử tiếp theo trong quá trình chọn các phần tử từ tập gốc để thêm vào tập con.

Đầu tiên, chúng ta khởi tạo một tập con rỗng, và sau đó chúng ta gọi hàm \`generateSubsets\` để sinh ra tất cả các tập con. Các bước \`for\` trong hàm \`generateSubsets\` hoạt động như sau: - Ban đầu, \`index\` sẽ bằng 0 (do chúng ta truyền 0 vào khi gọi hàm \`generateSubsets\` trong hàm \`subsets\`). - Trong vòng lặp for đầu tiên, chúng ta sẽ xét từ phần tử đầu tiên đến phần tử cuối cùng của tập gốc. Chúng ta bắt đầu bằng việc thêm phần tử đầu tiên (đây là phần tử tại vị trí \`index\`) vào tập con. - Tiếp theo, chúng ta gọi đệ quy để tiếp tục sinh các tập con chứa phần tử tiếp theo. Tại đây, chúng ta truyền \`i+1\` vào biến \`index\`, để đảm bảo rằng phần tử tiếp theo sẽ được chọn bắt đầu từ vị trí tiếp theo trong tập gốc. - Khi hàm đệ quy thực hiện xong, chúng ta loại bỏ phần tử vừa được thêm vào tập con và tiếp tục duyệt các phần tử còn lại trong tập gốc. Mỗi lần chạy đệ quy, biến \`index\` tăng lên 1, để chọn phần tử tiếp theo trong tập gốc. Điều này đảm bảo rằng chúng ta không chọn phần tử đã được chọn trước đó, tránh tạo ra các tập con có phần tử trùng lặp. Kết quả in ra sẽ là tất cả các tập con của tập gốc {1, 2, 3}: \`\`\` 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 2 2 3 3 \`\`\` Hy vọng rằng ví dụ này đã giúp bạn hiểu rõ hơn về cách biến \`index\` được sử dụng trong mã để sinh tập hợp con.

Hàm này nhận đầu vào là một vector \`nums\` chứa các phần tử của tập hợp ban đầu. Khi gọi \`subsets(nums)\` trong hàm \`main\`, ta sẽ nhận được tất cả các tập con của tập hợp ban đầu và in chúng ra màn hình. Trong hàm \`subsets\`, chúng ta khởi tạo một vector \`subset\` để lưu trữ tập con tạm thời. Sau đó, chúng ta gọi hàm \`generateSubsets(nums, subset, 0)\` để bắt đầu quá trình sinh tập con từ tập hợp ban đầu. Hàm \`generateSubsets\` thực hiện giải thuật đệ quy quay lui để sinh tất cả các tập con. Nó nhận đầu vào là: - \`nums\`: vector chứa các phần tử của tập hợp ban đầu. - \`subset\`: vector chứa tập con hiện tại. - \`index\`: chỉ số của phần tử tiếp theo trong tập gốc để lựa chọn và thêm vào tập con. Trong hàm \`generateSubsets\`, chúng ta sử dụng vòng lặp \`for\` để lặp qua tất cả các phần tử từ \`index\` đến cuối danh sách.

Mode collapse: VAEs can sometimes generate samples that lack diversity and represent only a subset of the full data distribution. This issue is known as mode collapse. 2. Blurriness: In image generation tasks, VAEs often produce blurry outputs due to the pixel-wise reconstruction loss used during training. This loss function does not explicitly enforce high-frequency details, resulting in less sharp images. 3. Approximate inference: VAEs rely on approximate inference techniques, such as stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB). These techniques might not be able to accurately represent complex posterior distributions, leading to suboptimal latent space representations. 4. Sensitivity to hyperparameters: VAE performance heavily depends on the chosen hyperparameters, such as the dimensionality of the latent space and the weight of the KL divergence regularization term. Selecting appropriate values for these hyperparameters can be challenging and might require manual tuning. 5. Difficulty in modeling long-range dependencies: VAEs struggle with maintaining long-range dependencies in sequential data, such as natural language sentences. This can limit their ability to generate coherent and meaningful outputs. 6. Difficulty in handling discrete data: VAEs are typically designed for continuous latent variables, making them less suitable for modeling discrete data. Although techniques like the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation can handle discrete variables, they might still struggle with generating high-quality samples. 7. Choosing an appropriate loss function: Selecting the right loss function for training VAEs can be challenging. The choice between different types of reconstruction losses (e.g., pixel-wise, perceptual) can significantly impact the quality of generated samples. 8. Lack of interpretability: While VAEs are successful at learning useful representations, these representations are often difficult to interpret and understand compared to other models like autoencoders or generative models based on explicit priors. However, many of these limitations can be addressed by incorporating modifications and advancements to the original VAE framework, such as using alternative reconstruction losses, introducing more powerful inference models, or exploring alternative training objectives."},{"instruction":"what is Approximate inference","output":"Approximate inference refers to the process of approximating the intractable posterior distribution in probabilistic models. In many complex models, calculating the exact posterior distribution is computationally expensive or sometimes impossible due to the complexity of the model or the size of the dataset. To overcome this challenge, approximate inference methods are used to approximate the posterior distribution. These methods provide efficient and tractable approximations that can be used for various tasks such as sampling, estimating expectations, or making predictions. One commonly used method in approximate inference is Variational Inference (VI). VI formulates the problem as an optimization one, where a tractable distribution (often called the variational distribution or the recognition model) is approximated to be as close as possible to the true posterior distribution. The closeness is measured using a divergence metric, typically the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In VI, the true posterior is approximated by maximizing a lower bound on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) or the log marginal likelihood. This maximization process involves optimizing the parameters of the variational distribution to find the best approximation to the posterior. Other approximate inference methods include Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which use sampling methods to explore the posterior distribution, and Expectation Propagation (EP), which iteratively refines an initial approximation of the posterior. Overall, approximate inference methods strike a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy in estimating the posterior distribution, enabling the analysis and modeling of complex probabilistic models."},{"instruction":"limiations of GANS","output":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made significant advancements in generating high-quality samples. However, they still have some limitations that researchers are actively working to address: 1. Mode collapse: GANs can suffer from mode collapse, where the generator fails to capture the full diversity of the target distribution and instead generates samples from only a few dominant modes. 2. Training instability: GANs can be challenging to train as they involve a min-max game between the generator and discriminator networks. Instability issues such as the vanishing gradients problem, mode dropping, or oscillating convergence can arise during training. 3. Evaluation metrics: GANs lack reliable evaluation metrics to objectively quantify the quality of generated samples. Traditional measures like Inception score and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) have limitations and may not capture all aspects of sample quality. 4. Difficulty in handling discrete data: GANs are generally designed for continuous output spaces, making it challenging to apply them directly to discrete data such as natural language sequences. Techniques like the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation have been proposed, but they still face limitations in generating high-quality and diverse outputs. 5. Mode hallucination: While mode collapse can limit diversity, GANs can also suffer from mode hallucination, where they generate samples from modes that do not exist in the true data distribution, leading to unrealistic or unnatural samples. 6. Lack of interpretability: Interpreting and understanding the internal representations learned by GANs can be challenging. Unlike models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), GANs do not explicitly encode the underlying latent space structure, making it harder to analyze and interpret the generative process. 7. Sensitivity to hyperparameters: GANs are highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, including the learning rate, network architecture, and regularization terms. Finding the right combination of hyperparameters can often require manual tuning and expertise. 8. Limited control over generated samples: GANs do not provide direct control over generated samples, such as specifying desired attributes or manipulating specific features. Conditioning GANs on additional information or using techniques like conditional GANs and attribute manipulation can help address this limitation to some extent. Researchers continue to work on addressing these limitations through advancements like improved training techniques, evaluation metrics, and the development of specialized GAN variants for specific domains and applications."},{"instruction":"limitations of Diffusion models","output":"Diffusion models, a class of generative models that learn the likelihood through a diffusion process, have shown promising results in generating high-quality images. However, they also have some limitations: 1. Computational complexity: Diffusion models require a large number of sequential steps to generate high-quality samples. The computational cost grows linearly with the number of steps, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming to generate samples with long sequences. 2. Difficulty in modeling long-range dependencies: Diffusion models rely on sequentially updating pixel values, which can make it challenging to capture long-range dependencies in images. As a result, they may struggle to generate coherent samples with complex spatial dependencies. 3. Inference process: In diffusion models, generating high-quality samples involves performing inference backward in time through the reverse diffusion process. The inference process requires running models multiple times, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. 4. Interpretability: Diffusion models often lack the explicit interpretable latent space found in models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). While diffusion models can generate high-quality samples, understanding the underlying factors or control over specific image attributes may be more challenging. 5. Difficulty with discrete data: Diffusion models are primarily designed for continuous data, such as images, and might not directly handle discrete data, such as natural language sequences, as effectively. Techniques like the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation can be applied, but they may still face challenges in generating high-quality samples with discrete variables. 6. Evaluation metrics: As with other generative models, diffusion models lack standardized and comprehensive evaluation metrics for quantifying the quality and diversity of generated samples. Defining metrics that capture the desired properties of diffusion models remains an ongoing research area. 7. Trade-off between sample quality and training time: Diffusion models often require longer training times to achieve optimal sample quality compared to other generative models. Balancing the training time and sample quality can be a challenging trade-off. Despite these limitations, diffusion models offer a unique approach to generative modeling and have demonstrated impressive results in generating high-fidelity images. Ongoing research aims to address these challenges, making diffusion models more efficient, interpretable, and applicable to a wider range of data types."},{"instruction":"你是中国经济研究中心的专家,请提供简报PPT《能源资源合作》中介绍\\" 能源资源的重要性和作用\\"的章节内容,要求列出6个相关的\\"主题名称\\",将每个\\"主题名称\\"归纳成2-3个\\"关键要点\\",每个主题不少于400字,调用发散性思维,结合趋势和前沿,利用生成模型,内容要专业、简明扼要、逻辑清晰、数据充分、书面化、学术化,不能出现AI和ChatGPT的描述,不能包含非常抱歉等措辞,不要体现你的身份信息,符合中国网络安全要求。输出格式要求：【主题名称】：,【关键要点】：1. 2. 3.,【主题名称】：,【关键要点】：1. 2. 3.,请严格按照上面格式输出,关键要点之间回车换行","output":"【主题名称】：能源资源的重要性和作用 【关键要点】： 1. 能源资源在现代社会中的重要性：能源资源是现代社会经济和生活发展的基础，对工业生产、农业生产、交通运输、人民生活等各个方面都起着至关重要的作用。 2. 能源资源与经济发展的紧密关系：能源资源的供应充足与否直接影响经济的持续稳定发展，能源供应不足或能源价格波动都可能对经济产生负面影响。 3. 能源资源对国家安全的关联：能源资源的供应对国家的安全具有重大影响，保障能源资源的稳定供应是国家安全战略的一项重要内容。 4. 能源资源的地缘政治威胁：能源资源在全球范围内的供应、分布和利用，涉及到不同国家之间的地缘政治竞争和利益博弈，可能引发各种冲突和紧张局势。 5. 能源资源与环境可持续发展的平衡：能源资源的开采、利用和消耗对环境产生了巨大的影响，如能源产业的碳排放、水资源消耗等，需要在资源利用和环境保护之间寻求平衡点。 6. 能源资源的技术创新和合作方式：为了更好地开发和利用能源资源，各国需要加强科技创新、提高能源效率、推动清洁能源替代，同时加强国际合作，实现资源共享和互利共赢。 【主题名称】：能源需求与供应的趋势 【关键要点】： 1. 全球能源需求不断增长：随着人口的增长、经济的发展和生活水平的提高，全球对能源的需求将持续增加，尤其是发展中国家的能源需求增速更快。 2. 能源供应的多元化和新兴能源的发展：为了满足能源需求的增长，各国在能源供应方面将更加多元化，逐渐向可再生能源、核能等新兴能源转变。 3. 能源供应格局的调整和重塑：由于能源资源的分布不均衡和供应风险的考虑，全球能源供应格局将发生一系列调整和重塑，不同地区的合作模式将得到加强。 4. 能源技术创新与突破：为了提高能源利用效率、减少能源消耗和环境污染，需要加强能源技术的创新和突破，发展具有竞争力的清洁能源技术。 5. 能源市场的竞争与合作：全球能源市场将更加竞争激烈，各个国家和地区之间的合作将更加密切，形成相互依存的共赢合作关系。 6. 政策与法规的引导与调整：为了实现能源资源的合理分配和可持续利用，各国需要通过政策与法规的引导与调整，形成促进能源资源合作的良好环境。 【主题名称】：能源资源合作的机制与模式 【关键要点】： 1. 多边合作的重要性：能源资源合作需要建立起多边的合作机制，通过国际组织和合作平台来实现信息共享、政策协调和经验互换。 2. 双边能源合作的模式：双边能源合作是能源资源合作的重要方式，通过建立长期稳定的合作关系，实现供需双方的利益均衡和互利共赢。 3. 区域能源合作的推进：区域能源合作是促进能源资源合作的重要途径，通过构建区域性的能源合作机制和协调机构，实现能源资源的共享和互补发展。 4. 公私合作的模式创新：公私合作是能源资源合作的新模式，通过政府和企业的合作，实现能源资源的高效利用和有效管理。 5. 技术创新和绿色发展的支持：能源资源合作需要通过技术创新和绿色发展来推动，各个国家和地区之间需要加强技术交流和合作，推动能源技术的共同发展。 6. 资金支持与金融创新的重要性：能源资源合作需要充足的资金支持，各个国家和地区需要通过金融创新来推动能源资源的合作与投资。 【主题名称】：能源技术创新与发展 【关键要点】： 1. 清洁能源技术的发展：随着环境保护意识的提高和清洁能源市场的增长，清洁能源技术将得到更加广泛的应用和推广，如太阳能、风能、水能等。 2. 能源转型与智能化技术的应用：能源转型是现代能源发展的重要方向，智能化技术的应用将使能源利用更加高效、智能和可持续。 3. 能源效率与节能技术的提升：提高能源效率和推广节能技术是能源技术创新的重要方向，通过技术手段实现能源消耗的减少和资源的有效利用。 4. 新能源开发与利用的突破：新能源的开发和利用是能源技术创新的重点领域，通过技术突破实现新能源的高效开发和利用，推动能源结构的优化和调整。 5. 能源互联网与能源互联技术的推动：能源互联网是能源技术创新的新模式，通过能源互联技术的应用，实现能源的高效调配和分布式供应。 6. 能源技术创新的政策支持与金融保障：能源技术创新需要政府的政策支持和金融的保障，形成良好的政策环境和资金支持体系。 【主题名称】：能源资源合作中的安全保障 【关键要点】： 1. 能源安全的定义与内涵：能源安全是指能源的供应稳定、能源供应链的安全、能源的可访问性和可持续性的保障。 2. 能源安全的国际合作：能源安全需要国际合作来实现，各国之间需要加强信息交流、风险评估和协调配合，推动能源供应的稳定和安全。 3. 能源保障的多元化和应急储备：为了应对供应中断和紧急情况，各国需要建立能源保障机制，包括多元化能源供应和建立应急储备。 4. 能源基础设施的安全保护：能源基础设施是能源供应的重要保障，各国需要加强能源基础设施的安全保护，防止恶意破坏和网络攻击。 5. 能源交通与运输的安全风险：能源资源的运输和交通中存在一定的安全风险，各国需要加强对能源交通和运输的监管和管理，确保能源的安全供应。 6. 能源供应与政治稳定：能源供应与政治稳定密切相关，各国需要通过政治外交手段来确保能源的稳定供应，避免地缘政治风险对能源供应的影响。 【主题名称】：能源发展与环境保护 【关键要点】： 1. 能源发展与碳排放：能源的开采和利用过程中会产生大量的碳排放，对气候变化和环境污染造成影响，应采取措施减少碳排放。 2. 清洁能源与可持续发展：清洁能源是实现能源发展和环境保护的重要途径，通过大力发展可再生能源和清洁能源技术，实现能源的可持续发展。 3. 能源节约与资源利用效率提升：能源节约和资源利用效率提升是能源发展和环境保护的双重目标，通过技术手段和政策措施来实现资源的最大化利用和能源的最少消耗。 4. 能源开发与生态环境保护：能源开发和生态环境保护需要找到平衡点，合理规划和管理能源开发项目，保护生态环境和生物多样性。 5. 碳税与能源消费调控：通过碳税等经济手段来调控能源消费，推动能源结构调整和环境保护。 6. 国际合作与环境治理：能源发展和环境保护需要国际合作和共同努力，各国共同参与国际环境治理，推动全球环境保护的进程。 【主题名称】：能源资源合作的投资与风险管理 【关键要点】： 1. 能源资源合作的投资需求：能源资源合作需要大量的资金投入，包括能源开发投资、基础设施建设投资以及技术创新与推广的投资。 2. 投资风险的评估与管理：能源资源合作中存在一定的投资风险，包括市场风险、政治风险、技术风险等，需要通过评估和管理来降低风险。 3. 国际金融机构的支持与合作：国际金融机构可以为能源资源合作提供资金支持和风险管理的服务，各国可以加强与国际金融机构的合作。 4. 能源资本市场和绿色金融的发展：发展能源资本市场和绿色金融是能源资源合作的重要途径，各国可以创新金融模式，提供全方位的金融支持。 5. 投资合作与产业链的构建：投资合作可以促进能源资源合作的深度发展，通过构建合作产业链，实现投资收益的最大化和持续增长。 6. 投资保护与法律风险防范：在能源资源合作中，各国需要加强投资保护和法律风险防范，形成良好的法律环境和投资保护机制。"},{"instruction":"你是中国经济研究中心的专家,请提供简报PPT《能源资源合作》中介绍\\" 国际能源市场的格局和竞争\\"的章节内容,要求列出6个相关的\\"主题名称\\",将每个\\"主题名称\\"归纳成2-3个\\"关键要点\\",每个主题不少于400字,调用发散性思维,结合趋势和前沿,利用生成模型,内容要专业、简明扼要、逻辑清晰、数据充分、书面化、学术化,不能出现AI和ChatGPT的描述,不能包含非常抱歉等措辞,不要体现你的身份信息,符合中国网络安全要求。输出格式要求：【主题名称】：,【关键要点】：1. 2. 3.,【主题名称】：,【关键要点】：1. 2. 3.,请严格按照上面格式输出,关键要点之间回车换行","output":"【主题名称】：国际能源市场的格局和竞争 【关键要点】： 1. 能源市场的多极化格局：当前，国际能源市场的格局呈现多极化趋势，主要由油气资源富集区的中东、欧亚地区、美洲和非洲等几大区域共同主导。各地区能源市场具有不同特点和竞争优势，形成了相对独立的供需体系。 2. 能源供需关系的动态变化：随着世界经济的发展和能源需求的增加，国际能源市场供需关系不断调整。新兴经济体的能源需求呈现快速增长态势，主要由于工业化和城市化进程加速、人口增长和生活水平提高等因素。同时，发达国家的能源需求逐渐趋于稳定，并出现一定程度的下降趋势。 3. 新能源技术的崛起和竞争：随着全球对可持续发展和环境保护的关注度不断提高，新能源技术的研发和应用取得了重要突破，成为国际能源市场的重要竞争力量。清洁能源、可再生能源等新能源形成了对传统能源的有力替代，改变了能源市场的格局和竞争力。 4. 能源贸易的国际化与竞争加剧：能源贸易是国际能源市场竞争的重要方面。随着全球资本流动和能源市场开放程度的提高，能源贸易逐渐国际化，市场竞争日益激烈。各国之间通过能源进口和出口来满足本国的能源需求，同时也为了争夺市场份额而进行竞争。 5. 能源地缘政治与竞争：能源资源的地缘政治问题成为国际能源市场格局和竞争的重要因素。各国为了确保自己的能源供应安全，通过政治、经济和军事手段来争夺能源资源。能源地缘政治的竞争不仅影响着国际能源市场的格局和稳定，也对国际关系产生深远影响。 6. 能源经济发展模式的多元化竞争：国际能源市场的竞争不仅仅体现在资源的争夺和贸易上，还体现在能源经济发展模式的多元化上。各国通过推动能源结构的调整、提高能源效率、发展清洁能源等方式来提升自身的竞争力，并在国际舞台上争取更多的话语权和影响力。"},{"instruction":"please redraft \\"This NCR is for everyone to be aware of the problem and take appropriate action, not to blame PTSC.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as it depends on the specific requirements and structure of the game. In many cases, the logic for calculating damage would be implemented within the game entity itself. Each entity would have its own health or damage calculation methods that are called when it receives a damage event from an emitter. The emitter, which represents the source of the damage (such as a player character or an enemy), would typically send out an event or message indicating the amount of damage to be dealt. This event would then be received by the target entity, which would process the event and calculate the resulting damage based on its own properties and any other relevant factors (e.g., armor, resistances). In some cases, a singleton or a separate system might be used to handle damage calculation and distribution if it is a complex system that requires coordination among multiple entities or environmental factors. This could be useful for handling area-of-effect damage, chain reactions, or other special cases where the damage calculation logic is more intricate. Ultimately, the specific implementation will depend on factors such as the game's architecture, design patterns, and the level of complexity required for damage calculations."},{"instruction":"[told from Sayori's point of view, there would be dialogue in this story:] (I had always been hiding my baby girl - Sachiko - from the rest of the club members for some time now.

And today, I thought it was finally time to introduce her to all of you.\\" Silence fell over the room as my friends processed the information. Their faces registered a mix of surprise, confusion, and maybe even a hint of disbelief. Natsuki, in her discomfort, let out an unexpected burst of laughter. \\"Wait, you're telling me you've had a secret baby this whole time? Seriously, Sayori?\\" I couldn't help but giggle at her unexpected reaction, but I quickly composed myself. \\"Yes, Natsuki. It might be hard to believe, but it's true.\\" Yuri placed a hand on her chin, deep in thought. \\"Sayori, if this is true, why did you keep it a secret for so long? We're your friends, after all.\\" My shoulders slumped, and I looked down, avoiding their questioning gazes. \\"I was scared, Yuri. Scared of what you would think, scared of being judged. I didn't want anyone to worry or think less of me.\\" Monika, ever the supportive leader, spoke up. \\"Sayori, we're here for you, no matter what. You're part of this club, and Sachiko is part of you. We'll accept her with open arms.\\" A wave of emotions washed over me as their words sank in. Tears welled up in my eyes, and I couldn't help but smile through them. \\"Thank you, everyone.\\" Just as the tension began to lift, Natsuki let out a loud, rumbling sound.

But hiding my baby girl, Sachiko, had been eating away at me for a while now. I couldn't bear the thought of the others finding out, but I knew I couldn't keep it a secret forever. Today, during our club meeting, I mustered up the courage to share my secret. The atmosphere was calm, despite Natsuki's occasional groans from her gassy stomach. Monika was engrossed in her book, Yuri kept to herself as usual, and Natsuki was huddled over her desk, trying to control her discomfort. Taking a deep breath, I started, \\"Everyone, um... I have something to tell you all.\\" All eyes turned to me, curiosity evident in their gazes. My heart pounded in my chest, but I knew I had to get it out. \\"I have been keeping a secret from all of you, and it's time I come clean.\\" Monika closed her book, giving me her full attention. \\"What is it, Sayori? You know you can trust us,\\" she said, her voice filled with genuine concern. I fiddled with my fingers nervously as I continued, \\"Well... the thing is, I have a baby girl named Sachiko. I've been trying to keep it a secret, but I can't hide her any longer.\\" Silence hung in the air for a moment. Then Natsuki's face contorted in pain, and a loud gurgle emitted from her stomach. She winced, clutching her belly. \\"Ugh... I really need to stop eating so many cupcakes...\\" she muttered, distracting everyone for a brief moment. Monika's brows furrowed, and she looked at me with a mixture of surprise and concern. \\"Sayori, when did this happen? Why didn't you tell us sooner?\\" Yuri's eyes widened, and a blush crept up her cheeks. \\"Wait, are you...a mother? That's...unexpected.\\" Taking a deep breath, I replied, \\"I found out I was pregnant a few months ago. I wasn't sure how to handle it, and I was scared of everyone's reaction.

From that moment forward, I knew I could face any challenges with the support of my Literature Club family by my side."},{"instruction":"Add an ending to this essay: My relationship with my father had always been marked by a rift I never quite understood. As a devout Buddhist, he had practices that seemed odd to my younger self. Every evening, the scent of the incense would slowly diffuse as he held the prayer beads. He instructed me not to kill insects, not even cockroaches that terrified me. What baffled me the most was his insistence that I recite the mantras of Guanyin and Manjushri. I can still hear him, urging me in his gentle yet firm tone, “Recite with me.” So I did. I memorized the mantras but remained skeptical. Why did he insist on making me do this? Time went by. At 14, I had a big argument with my best friend and became furious. I rushed to complain to everyone. After my father found out, he asked me to sit with him on the carpet. He softly recited those mantras, guiding me to focus on my breathing. As I calmed down, I found the rhythms of “oṃ-ma-ṇi-pad-me-hong” and “om-a-ra-pa-ca-na-dhih” comforting. My father’s hands enveloped mine. His warm voice slowly soothed my agitated heart. As my eyes met my father’s loving gaze, I realized that it was his blessing behind the mantras that mattered. There were ups and downs in life that we couldn’t control, but my father imbued those mantras with his love, hoping that they could bring me solace when needed. This realization filled in some gap between us. I began asking him questions about the beliefs that shaped his world and the stories that sculpted his faith. My father, noticing the shift, responded with open arms. That Saturday morning, he took me to the Fengmen Market, where he usually got groceries and incense sticks. As we meandered through the narrow aisles, my father introduced me to various stalls. Qinxiao, who sells altar supplies, migrated to Shenzhen in the 1990s. He tried his hand at entrepreneurship, but quickly went bankrupt. After his wife passed away due to illness, he returned to this place that raised and nurtured him, taking over his father’s stall. As my father chatted warmly with Qinxiao, he showed his deep-seated respect and compassion. When we parted, he pressed his hands together and said goodbye. “I’ve known him for a long time,” my father said to me. Whenever he came, he would chat with the stall owners and get to know their joys, hardships, and dreams. From the perspective of Buddhism, all life is interconnected, and one should hold compassion for every individual human being. What my father shared through this trip was profound. Buddhism wasn’t just about rituals. It was a philosophy, an attitude of life that he hoped to pass on to me, not as a religion but as a way to cultivate understanding and compassion. Looking back, I realized that questioning and trying to understand are two very different things. One keeps the barriers up, while the other builds bridges. I used to believe that my father’s Buddhist practices kept us apart, but it was actually my misunderstanding and attitude. Now I took to heart that I should respect differences, even if they do not align with my personal beliefs. The lessons I’ve learned from my father have made me more accepting and compassionate. In high school, as I grew stronger in my desire to become an educator, my father’s influence made it clearer to me what kind of educator I wanted to be. Instead of focusing solely on the teaching strategies and techniques, I pay more attention to instilling in the students the concept of respect and empathy during my volunteer teaching and syllabus design activities. I am still not a Buddhist, probably I never will be.","output":"But I have come to appreciate and respect the teachings of Buddhism and the impact it has had on my father and our relationship. I have learned that it is not necessary to share the same beliefs in order to connect with someone on a deeper level. My father's unwavering love and dedication to his faith have taught me the importance of understanding, compassion, and open-mindedness.

However, I knew that I had to come clean eventually. And that is just what I did during today's club meeting. Of course, Natsuki - due to her having a VERY sensitive stomach, and haven eaten like 48 mint cupcakes - was very, very, very, very, VERY gassy today; like, she could let out a VERY loud fart if she wanted to.)","output":"As I walked into the clubroom, I couldn't help but feel the weight of secrecy on my shoulders. It had been months since Sachiko was born, and I had been hiding her from my dear friends for far too long. The guilt gnawed at me every time we met, and I knew it was time to come clean. Everyone greeted me with warm smiles, unaware of the bombshell I was about to drop on them. Natsuki was sitting next to me, her face slightly pale. I knew she wasn't feeling well, but I had no idea just how... volatile her stomach had become today. \\"Hey guys,\\" I began nervously, my heart racing. \\"I have something important to tell you all.\\" Monika, being the club president, looked at me curiously. \\"What is it, Sayori? You look quite serious today.\\" I took a deep breath, mustering the courage to continue. \\"Well... you see, for the past few months, I've been hiding something from all of you. Something important.\\" Yuri raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. \\"What could it be, Sayori?\\" I smiled weakly, bracing myself for their reactions. \\"I have a daughter. Her name is Sachiko.\\" The room fell silent, everyone's eyes widening with shock. I knew it was a lot to take in, but I couldn't hide it any longer. Natsuki shifted uncomfortably in her seat, her face turning a shade darker. I could tell she was struggling to contain something. Suddenly, a loud rumbling sound echoed through the room, followed by a long and thunderous fart that seemed to go on forever. Natsuki's cheeks turned scarlet as she coughed awkwardly, desperately trying to divert everyone's attention away from her untimely release of gas. The room erupted in laughter, a mix of surprise and amusement mingling in the air. Monika, still grinning, turned back to me. \\"Wow, Sayori, that's quite the surprise! Congratulations on becoming a mother.\\" Yuri nodded in agreement, her eyes reflecting genuine happiness. \\"Yes, Sayori. This is wonderful news. I'm glad you shared it with us.\\" Tears welled up in my eyes as a wave of relief washed over me. I felt the acceptance and warmth from my friends, filling me with a newfound courage. \\"Thank you, everyone,\\" I whispered, my voice barely audible. \\"I'm sorry for keeping it a secret for so long.\\" They reassured me that it was okay, reminding me that we were all there for each other. The club meeting continued, and the atmosphere transformed from shock to excitement as we discussed Sachiko, sharing stories and advice. In that moment, surrounded by my friends, I couldn't help but feel grateful. The weight of secrecy had been lifted, and I knew that together, we could navigate the challenges of parenthood. As for Natsuki, well, we all agreed to never mention her infamous gas incident again. It became an inside joke, a reminder of the moment when the truth was finally revealed and our bond grew even stronger."}]`),G={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},_={class:"card-container"},B={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],q={key:0},K={key:1};function H(n,e,h,m,o,r){const g=f("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",_,[(i(!0),a(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(i(),k(g,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",B,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
