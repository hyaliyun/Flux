(WJZ)– Montgomery County police in Maryland continue to look for a pregnant teacher who didn’t show up for the first day of class.      Police say Olney resident, Laura Elizabeth Wallen, 31, last contacted family members by text message on Monday.      Wallen failed to show up for the first day of classes Tuesday at Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, where she teaches history and law.      “She was a favorite amongst the students. She was really nice and this is really sad, what’s happening, you see it’s really taking a toll on people,” said student Paris Cooper.      Relatives of Wallen confirmed that she was excited about her pregnancy, never gave signs that anything was bothering her and left her dog behind.      “I’m hoping they find her and I’m hoping that she’ll be alive and well,” said neighbor Joyce Robinson.      Police won’t reveal the context of the text message she sent the family.      “That was alarming enough that the family said ‘we need to call police,'” Sgt. Rebecca Innocenti said.      Wallen spent days preparing her classroom, which makes it unusual that she didn’t show up.      She earned honors as senior class teacher last year.      “People are concerned for her safety,” said Brian Bassett of Howard County Schools. “I know she’s really highly regarded at Wilde Lake High School.”      Students flooded social media using the hashtag #BringWallenHome.      Wallen is 5-foot-5-inches tall, weighs 200 pounds and has blonde hair and blue eyes.      Police are also looking for her car, a black 2011 Ford Escape with Maryland license plate M522473.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted, while Léon Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a \\"direct citation\\" of Ingres' portrait. Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, \\"Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference\\". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her \\"massive, monumental presence\\". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, \\"That's Madame Bertin!\\"The influence continued through the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of Ralph Vaughan Williams between 1952 and 1961. In 1975 Marcel Broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.

The phrase addresses the idea of someone potentially not possessing as strong psychic (in terms of supernatural or extrasensory perception) or intuitive abilities as may be desired, expected, or required for a situation. In a broader sense, this phrase can be used to question someone's ability to predict or understand things without sufficient evidence or information. Czech, which is a Slavic language and also called čeština, is spoken by more than 10 million people, primarily in the Czech Republic. It belongs to the West Slavic subgroup within the Slavic language family, which also includes Polish, Slovak, and Sorbian languages. When translating a phrase, it is important to consider the cultural context and idiomatic expressions in each language, as these elements are crucial for retaining the intended meaning and impact of the translation. While it is not always possible to render a phrase with its exact meaning and nuance, a skilled translator will always strive for the closest equivalent that makes sense in the target language. In this case, \\"Ne dostatečně jasnovidný?\\" accurately captures the essence of the question being asked and would be well-understood by Czech speakers.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of this story, Rialto Bridge's is probably: Options:  A. still new  B.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Nuclear Assault is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed after bassist Dan Lilker left Anthrax in 1984. After releasing five full-length albums and touring relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Nuclear Assault split up in 1995. They briefly reunited in 1997 and again in 2002, and are still active today.  - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - Metal Blade Records is a heavy metal record label founded by Brian Slagel in 1982. The U.S. corporate office for Metal Blade is located in Agoura Hills, California. It also has offices in Germany, Japan, Canada, and the UK. The label is distributed in the U.S. by RED Distribution, and in Canada by Sony Music Entertainment. It was distributed by Warner Bros. Records in the United States from 1988 to 1993.  - ( Pitch.Black.Effects ) is the fifth and final studio album by the extreme metal band Callenish Circle .  - Callenish Circle was an extreme metal band from the Netherlands. They recorded three of their albums for Metal Blade Records, and broke up in February 2007. In the early 2000s things were going well for the band. In 2002 they toured with God Dethroned, played at the Dutch version of Ozzfest and the German Party San Open Air, and opened for Dimmu Borgir. Their fourth album was released by Metal Blade in 2003; to support it they played that year's Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze festivals in Germany, and in October they were part of the Bonded By Metal Over Europe-tour, headlined by Exodus, Nuclear Assault, and Agent Steel. In 2006 they toured Mexico (cited by the band as the high point of their career), before they decided to break up in 2007.  - Wacken Open Air (W:O:A) is a summer open-air heavy metal music festival. It takes place annually in the small village of Wacken in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. With 80,000 festival visitors, and including personnel a total of roughly 86,000 attendees in 2011, it attracts various kinds of metal and hard rock music fans.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? To prepare homemade lox, you’ll need 1 ½ to 2 pounds (680 to 907 g) of boneless salmon fillet with the skin on. Run some cold water in the sink and rinse the fillet well. Next, examine the fillet to make sure that all of the bones have been removed.  You can purchase either \\"belly lox\\" or regular \\"lox\\" fillets. Both are salmon, but belly lox comes from the stomach region of the fish. The graining of fat in the stomach region makes belly lox the better option to use when you make lox because it is more widely spaced. This results in a final product that is more desirable and less salty. If there are any pin bones left in the salmon fillet, use a small pair of tweezers or pliers to pull them out in the same direction that they’re facing. Pin bones are more likely to occur in wild salmon than farmed salmon. Once the salmon is thoroughly rinsed, use a sharp knife to cut the fillet in half. Make sure that the pieces are as equal in size as you can get them. Add 1 cup (288 g) of kosher salt and 1 cup (200 g) of sugar to a medium bowl. Mix the ingredients together well so they’re fully blended. If you like, you can also add about ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of coarsely ground black pepper to the mixture. Place the two pieces of salmon in a shallow dish so they’re side by side. Pour an equal amount of the salt mixture over each piece, piling it right on top of the salmon. It may seem that there is a lot of excess salt mixture on the salmon, but the fish will absorb it during the curing process. After you’ve added the salt mixture to the salmon pieces, divide half a bunch of dill with the stems removed between them and add it on top of the salt. Next, place one of the salmon pieces on top of the other, being careful not to knock off the salt mixture. When the salmon pieces are sandwiched together, carefully wrap them in plastic wrap. Once the fish is secure in the plastic wrap, set it in a large plastic zipper bag. Before closing the zipper bag, be sure to push all of the air out of it first. Set the bag with the salmon down in a shallow dish. Place another heavy dish on top of the bag to weigh it down, and refrigerate the fish for 2 to 3 days. You can use any heavy item, such as a bottle of wine, to weigh down the salmon. While you’re curing the salmon, it’s important to keep it from getting soggy. Remove any liquid that’s been extracted from the salmon from the plastic bag and flip the fish over so both sides are evenly weighed down. At the two day mark, begin tasting the lox. Once it has the taste that desire, you can take it out of the curing container and unwrap it. If the lox isn’t properly cured after two days, you should leave in the container for another day. After you’ve removed the fish from the plastic wrap, rinse it well under cold water to remove any residue. Use a sharp knife to cut it thin on the bias. Make sure to leave the skin behind. You can freeze the lox if you don’t plan to eat all of it right away. Wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer bag for storage. You should eat it within 3 to 4 months.","output":"This article provides a step-by-step guide to making homemade lox using boneless salmon fillet, a salt and sugar mixture, dill, and a curing process of 2-3 days in the refrigerator before slicing and consuming, with the option to freeze and store for up to 4 months."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Add 2 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the right side. -12 + 2 = 5*l - 2 + 2 This simplifies to: -10 = 5*l Step 2: Solve for the variable l. Now you need to isolate l by dividing both sides of the equation by 5.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Magma comes up to the surface of the earth - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed - The crystals contain minerals.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Minerals become common happens, how will it affect MORE minerals forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that if minerals become more common, it would affect the formation of MORE minerals. In the context of the described process, the abundance of minerals does not have a direct effect on the formation of new minerals. The process you mentioned involves the cooling of magma, which leads to the formation of crystals containing minerals. This process is primarily driven by the cooling of magma and the movement of particles inside it rather than the abundance or scarcity of minerals. However, an indirect effect can be considered. If minerals become more common, it might suggest that there is an increase in volcanic or tectonic activity, leading to more magma reaching the surface of the Earth. In this case, the increased magma would provide more opportunities for crystal formation, which in turn would lead to the development of more minerals. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis does not have a direct effect on the process itself, it could potentially have an indirect effect by influencing the conditions that are needed for this process to occur."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1959, on board a spacecraft, two aliens race to keep an experiment from being released by a third member of the crew. The seemingly possessed third alien shoots the canister into space where it crashes to Earth. Nearby, a college man takes his date to a parking spot when they see a falling star and investigate. It lands in the path of an escaped criminally insane mental patient. As his date is attacked by the axe-wielding maniac, the boy finds the canister, from which a small slug-like thing jumps out and into his mouth. Twenty-seven years later, Chris Romero pines over a love lost, supported by his disabled friend J.C. During pledge week at Corman University, Chris spots a girl, Cynthia Cronenberg, and falls instantly in love. To get her attention, he decides to join a fraternity. Cynthia's boyfriend, who heads the fraternity, tasks them with stealing a cadaver from the university medical center and depositing it on the steps of a sorority house. Chris and J.C. find a frozen corpse in a secret room, but when it grabs them, they flee. Meanwhile, Detective Ray Cameron, a haunted cop, is called in to the cryogenics lab break-in, where he discovers one of the bodies â the boy who discovered the alien experiment in 1959 â is now missing, set free by Chris and J.C. The corpse makes its way back to the sorority house where he picked up his date twenty-seven years ago. There, his head splits open and releases more of the slugs. Called to the scene, Det. Cameron finds the body, interpreting the condition of the head as the result of an axe wound in the face. The next day, the fraternity brothers confront Chris and J.C., who they believe to be responsible for the previous night's incident. They are then taken in for questioning by the police. Based on the testimony of a janitor that witnessed them running out of the university medical center, \\"screaming like banshees,\\" they confess to breaking in but deny moving the corpse. That night, a dead attendant rises from his slab and runs into the same janitor. Cynthia...

It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“. This is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows. Question: Who does the author feel should be accountable for their words? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The author feels that everyone, regardless of their status as a community member, commentator, employee, or any other position, should be accountable for their words. The author also believes that accountability does not just end with sharing one's viewpoints on a blog, but extends to engaging with readers' comments, criticisms, and perspectives in a respectful and polite manner. By allowing open and healthy debate, individuals demonstrate their true character and their willingness to engage in meaningful discourse, rather than silencing opposing views."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: moon rising over the lake in the night","output":"In the given sentence \\"moon rising over the lake in the night\\", the most salient words that convey the core meaning and imagery of the sentence are: 1. Moon: The celestial body that orbits around the Earth, visible at night. In this context, it signifies the primary subject of the sentence and the source of light in the night scene being described. 2. Rising: This word refers to the motion of the moon as it appears to move upward in the sky. It helps to create a vivid picture of the moon at a specific point in time, possibly early in the night when the moon is still relatively low in the sky. 3. Lake: As the geographical feature mentioned in the sentence, the lake is significant because it provides context for the setting. It is a key element in the scene being described, and the presence of water offers a potential for reflection and added visual interest. 4. Night: This word helps to define the time the scene takes place. As the opposite of day, night offers a particular atmosphere, often associated with darkness, tranquility, and the presence of stars and other celestial bodies that are not visible during the day.

Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: \\"At seven tomorrow night\\", the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go.

A Concerned Veterans for America spokesman , Jim Fellinger , told us each CVA event with Cruz was open to the public by registration , without the group screening out anybody who registered .  Regardless , the Houston lawyer was told during the 2017 Texas Tribune Festival about a Democratic challenger 's suggestion that Cruz had n't visited small Texas towns during the term he won in 2012 .  \\"Do you do enough interaction with your constituents , Sen.

RNA (ribonucleic acid) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, which is the process of creating proteins in cells. This statement relates to the \\"Central Dogma of Molecular Biology,\\" which describes how genetic information from DNA is used to create proteins, which are vital elements of cellular functionality and structure. To understand the synthesis of proteins via RNA, let's look at the types of RNA and their respective roles: 1. mRNA (Messenger RNA): Messenger RNA is synthesized from a DNA template through a process known as transcription. DNA stores the genetic information required for the development and the functioning of organisms; however, DNA is stationary within the cell nucleus and cannot directly contribute to protein synthesis. Therefore, regions of DNA that encode specific proteins are transcribed into complementary mRNA sequences. This mRNA then serves as a portable set of instructions, traveling out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm of the cell, where protein synthesis takes place. 2. rRNA (Ribosomal RNA): This type of RNA is a major component of the ribosomes, the cell's protein-producing factories. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis, where the decoding of mRNA into a polypeptide chain (protein) takes place. 3. tRNA (Transfer RNA): Transfer RNA acts as the link between the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins. It \\"reads\\" the genetic information from the mRNA in sets of three bases known as codons, and it secures the corresponding amino acid. tRNA then brings the amino acids to the ribosomes to aid in the construction of the protein. In summary, during protein synthesis, DNA's needed information is first transcribed into mRNA. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and is translated by the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The ribosomes, along with tRNA, translate the genetic information in the mRNA into a string of amino acids to form a protein. This complex, multi-step procedure demonstrates how RNA is indispensable in the creation of proteins, vital molecules that carry out a wide variety of functions within organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: The answer to the question: What year was Just a Gigolo first recorded? is inside the article: According to jazz critic Gary Giddins, Misterioso is a hard bop record. The songs performed for the album were arranged by Monk, who reworked four of his earlier compositions. In the album's liner notes, Keepnews wrote of Monk's approach to arrangements: \\"It should be axiomatic that Monk is a constantly self-renewing composer-arranger-musician, that each new recording of an 'old' number, particularly with different personnel, represents a fresh view of it—almost a new composition.\\" In the producer's opinion, Monk played the piano more vividly and less introspectively than on his studio recordings in response to the enthusiastic crowds he drew nightly to the venue.On \\"Nutty\\", Griffin incorporated lines from \\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\\" and exhibited a frenetic swing that was complemented by counterplay from Haynes and Monk. \\"Blues Five Spot\\", a new composition by Monk for the album, is a twelve-bar blues homage to the Five Spot Café and featured solos from each player. Griffin and Monk transfigured chord structures and melodies throughout the performance. Griffin's solo vamp maintained the rhythm while quoting lines from other pieces, including the theme song for the animated Popeye theatrical shorts; he played \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\" at the end of \\"Blues Five Spot\\". The quartet began \\"In Walked Bud\\" with an eight-bar piano intro and thirty-two-bar form. Griffin began his solo a minute into the song with saxophone wails. In the third minute, Monk did not play, while Griffin played fast phrases at the top of his register with intermittently slower R&B and free jazz elements. Monk shouted approvingly throughout Griffin's solo before he resumed piano and played a two-minute theme. \\"Just a Gigolo\\", a standard, was the only song on the album not composed by Monk, who performed it in a brief, unaccompanied version.

It looked like a cloud with a ponytail . Odd thing . The twisting of the tip hanging down made it more obvious , though : it was a tornado ! Question What may have caused the tornado ? Answer:","output":"The tornado may have been caused by a combination of atmospheric conditions and weather patterns. Here are the steps that might have led to its formation: 1. Warm, moist air: The presence of warm, moist air near the ground level is a critical factor in tornado development. This air is typically associated with a low-pressure system, which can promote the formation of thunderstorms. 2. Temperature gradient: A significant temperature gradient between the warm, moist air and cooler, drier air at higher altitudes must be present. This temperature difference can result in the formation of a strong updraft within the thunderstorm, which is an essential element for tornadoes to develop. 3. Wind shear: The presence of wind shear, or a difference in wind speed and direction between the ground level and higher altitudes, is another important factor in tornado formation. Wind shear can cause the updraft within the thunderstorm to rotate, creating a rotating column of air known as a mesocyclone. 4. Trigger mechanism: A specific event or condition, such as the passage of a cold front or the collision of two air masses, can act as a trigger for the tornado. This trigger can cause the rotation within the mesocyclone to tighten and intensify, eventually leading to the formation of a visible funnel cloud. 5. Touchdown: Once the funnel cloud has formed, it can continue to intensify and potentially touch down on the ground, at which point it officially becomes a tornado. The tornado can then move along the ground, picking up debris and causing damage until it eventually weakens and dissipates. In summary, the tornado the user witnessed was likely caused by a combination of warm, moist air close to the ground, a significant temperature gradient, the presence of wind shear, and a specific trigger event that caused the rotation to intensify and form a visible funnel cloud."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: Although the Zionist movement already existed in practice, Austro-Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism, a movement which sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, thus offering a solution to the so-called Jewish Question of the European states, in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"Yes, the answer correctly identifies Theodor Herzl as the founder of political Zionism.  Theodor Herzl was a Jewish-Austro Hungarian journalist and playwright who is most known for his pivotal role in the creation of the modern Zionist movement. Herzl's Zionism was unique in its emphasis on political strategy, as opposed to previous efforts that had largely focused on small-scale settlement and religious contemplation.  Born in Budapest in 1860, Herzl became acutely conscious of the Jewish Question, an increasingly common topic of debate in Europe which questioned how to integrate the often marginalized and persecuted Jews with the rest of society. This question became intensely personal for Herzl following the Dreyfus affair in France, where Herzl was stationed as a journalist. This highly publicized event saw a Jewish military officer falsely accused of treason, highlighting the rampant antisemitism in Europe.  Motivated by such events, Herzl believed that the establishment of a Jewish state would enable Jews to control their own fate, free from persecution and fully integrated into the world community as equals. He wrote these ideas down in his pamphlet \\"Der Judenstaat\\" or \\"The Jewish State\\", published in 1896. This pamphlet sparked the Zionist political movement and led to the first Zionist Congress in 1897, hosted by Herzl in Basel, Switzerland. Herzl's political Zionism not only insisted on the necessity of a Jewish state for the future security of Jewish people, but also outlined practical means to achieve this end. It involved diplomacy with world powers to obtain a charter for Jewish settlement, and proposed methods for organizing Jewish migrants and investing in the economic development of the Jewish state. This pragmatic avenue to achieve Jewish self-determination distinguished Herzl's political Zionism and offered a concrete plan to end Jewish suffering in the diaspora.  Therefore, while Zionism as a concept did exist prior to Herzl’s efforts, he is recognized as the founder of political Zionism due to his emphasis on practical political means to establish a Jewish state, making a significant impact on redefining Jewish national aspirations."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the Gujarati language and a corresponding English translation of the Gujarati sentence.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. a plant requires water to grow A plant would prefer","output":"Water is essential for the growth and overall well-being of plants. It plays a critical role in many processes that occur within the plant, ensuring that it remains healthy and reaches its full potential. The reasons a plant requires water to grow can be extensively elaborated upon, as they involve various aspects of plant biology, physiology, and overall development. Water enables the uptake of nutrients, as it is the primary medium through which nutrients are absorbed by plant roots. When water is absorbed through a plant's root hairs, nutrients dissolved in the soil solution come alongside it, providing essential elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Once these nutrients are taken up by the roots, water acts as a transportation medium, allowing the movement of these essential nutrients throughout the plant via the xylem. Additionally, water plays a central role in photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy for growth and other functions. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, the small organelles found in plant cells, where water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight are combined to produce glucose, a primary source of energy for plants. In this process, oxygen molecules are released as a byproduct. Without water, the photosynthesis process comes to a halt, inhibiting the plant's ability to produce energy for growth. Transpiration, another essential function dependent on water, is a vital factor in plant growth. Transpiration is the process of water evaporating from a plant's leaves, primarily through tiny pores called stomata. This loss of water creates a driving force that draws more water up from the plant's roots, ensuring constant water and nutrient supply. As the evaporation of water occurs, it helps regulate the plant's temperature, removing excess heat and allowing the plant to maintain an optimal temperature for growth and development. Furthermore, the opening and closing of stomata, which controls transpiration rate, also play a crucial role in regulating gas exchange between the plant and its environment. Water also acts as a support system for plants by providing turgor pressure. When plant cells absorb water, they expand, exerting pressure against the cell walls, which in turn provides structure and rigidity. This turgor pressure is critical for maintaining the plant's overall structure and ensuring that stems and leaves remain firm and erect. Without adequate water, cells lose their turgor pressure, resulting in a wilting appearance and impaired structural integrity. In terms of a plant's preference for water, it's essential to consider several factors such as water quality, quantity, and frequency.  1. Water quality: Plants generally prefer water free from contaminants, such as excessive salts, chemicals, or pollutants, which could negatively impact growth or cause toxicity. In many cases, rainwater is considered the ideal water source, as it is relatively free of impurities. However, tap water and groundwater can also be suitable if they meet quality requirements. 2. Water quantity: Sufficient water must be provided to meet the plant's needs, which can vary depending on the specific plant species, stage of development, pot or root size, and environmental conditions such as light and temperature. Over or under-watering can lead to issues like root rot, nutrient deficiencies, and growth impairment. 3. Water frequency: The regularity at which a plant receives water is also crucial. Generally, plants prefer a consistent watering schedule that is neither too frequent nor too infrequent. The ideal watering frequency is dependent on the species and its specific requirements, as well as the growing conditions and environmental factors. In conclusion, plants require water for a multitude of reasons, including nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, transpiration, and structural support, among other vital functions. The preferences of a plant concerning water quality, quantity, and frequency must be carefully considered to ensure optimal growth and overall health."},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body.  Question: suppose a person is doing physical work happens, how will it affect more heat is drawn.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"When a person is doing physical work, more heat will be drawn from their body. This is because physical work generates heat as the body's muscles are producing energy to perform the tasks. Hence, the correct answer is A: more. To elaborate further, let's discuss the factors involved in this process and how they contribute to drawing more heat from the body. 1. Metabolism and heat generation: During physical work, the body's metabolism increases to produce more energy. As a result, this higher metabolic rate leads to increased heat generation within the body, creating a need for the body to dissipate the excess heat effectively. 2. Blood circulation: To help maintain body temperature, blood circulation increases to distribute the heat generated during physical work more evenly. Increased blood flow enhances the heat exchange between the body's core and the skin surface, facilitating heat loss. 3. Muscle activity: As muscles work harder during physical work, they generate more heat as a byproduct of their energy metabolism. This additional heat must be dissipated through the body's thermal regulatory mechanisms, which involve drawing heat away. 4. Sweating: As the body's temperature rises during physical work, sweating increases to help create a cooling effect. The evaporation of sweat draws heat away from the body, allowing the body to maintain an optimal temperature. More physical work results in greater sweat production, leading to more heat being drawn from the body. 5. Increased exposed surface area: During physical work, the body's exposed surface area may increase due to clothing adjustments or body positioning. This increased surface area allows for more effective heat loss as the evaporative cooling effect is amplified. Overall, when a person engages in physical work, various physiological processes occur that result in more heat being drawn from the body. These processes help to maintain an optimal temperature, ensuring the body can continue to function efficiently during intense physical activity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It mentions \\"contraceptives\\" instead of \\"birth control.\\" While these terms are often used interchangeably, they are not exactly the same. Contraceptives are a type of birth control that specifically prevents fertilization or implantation, while birth control also includes methods that work after fertilization has occurred, such as abortion itself.  Moreover, the hypothesis does not specifically mention \\"indigenous groups\\", but rather broadly refers to \\"almost all the groups they work with.\\" The premise is focused on the indigenous groups, while the hypothesis could be perceived as including other non-indigenous groups as well. Therefore, given the differences in the specific wording and focus, it is not possible to definitively say that the premise entails the hypothesis without more context or clarification on the terms and the groups being discussed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people thought the All Blacks would win easily because they were the favorite team and the game was being played in their country.  However, the French fans still believed in their team and wanted to show support. They gathered in many places, called fan zones, to watch the game together.

January 25, 1861), on February 16, 1852 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Russell was the second of five children, of whom two survived into adulthood. His mother died when he was 9 years old. The Russells lived for a time in Philadelphia before moving to Pittsburgh, where they became members of the Presbyterian Church. With the formation of the Watch Tower Society, Russell intensified his ministry. His Bible study group had grown to hundreds of local members, with followers throughout New England, the Virginias, Ohio, and elsewhere. They annually re-elected him \\"Pastor\\", and commonly referred to him as \\"Pastor Russell\\". Congregations that eventually formed in other nations also followed this tradition.  In 1881, Russell published his first work to gain wide distribution: Food for Thinking Christians. The 162-page \\"pamphlet\\" was published using donated funds amounting to approximately 40,000 (current value 1,014,345). It had a circulation of nearly 1.5 million copies over a period of four months distributed throughout the United States, Canada and Great Britain by various channels. During the same year he published Tabernacle and its Teachings which was quickly expanded and reissued as Tabernacle Shadows of the \\"Better Sacrifices\\", outlining his interpretation of the various animal sacrifices and tabernacle ceremonies instituted by Moses. Russell claimed that the distribution of these works and other tracts by the Watch Tower Society during 1881 exceeded by eight times that of the American Tract Society for the year 1880.  In 1903, newspapers began publishing his written sermons. These newspaper sermons were syndicated worldwide in as many as 4,000 newspapers, eventually reaching an estimated readership of some 15 million in the United States and Canada.  In 1910 the secular journal Overland Monthly calculated that by 1909, Russell's writings had become the most widely distributed, privately produced English-language works in the United States. It said that the entire corpus of his works were the third most circulated on earth, after the Bible and the Chinese Almanac. In 1912 The Continent, a Presbyterian journal, stated that in North America Russell's writings had achieved a greater circulation \\"than the combined circulation of the writings of all the priests and preachers in North America.\\"  Russell also had many critics, and he was frequently described as a heretic in this period. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What else did he publish?","output":"Charles Taze Russell published many things, but a few examples are a book called \\"Food for Thinking Christians\\" and another one called \\"Tabernacle and its Teachings\\" which was later expanded and reissued as \\"Tabernacle Shadows of the 'Better Sacrifices'\\".

Using evidence from the passage, it can be inferred that Dean has strong feelings about the situations involving Sam, Evan, and their respective loved ones. When the passage mentions \\"how desperate [Evan] was about his wife's impending death and that he [has] (and still would) do anything to prevent it,\\" it demonstrates that Evan's actions are driven by a deep emotional attachment to his wife. Furthermore, Dean's point about how Evan's wife would feel provides insight into his understanding of the consequences of desperate actions. The passage also discusses Sam's death and Dean's deal, which brings attention to the connections between these two characters. The fact that Dean's ticket comes due after Sam dies suggests that Dean is likely to feel the weight of the loss. Although it does not explicitly state Dean's emotional state, the passage hints at the emotional consequences of these events. Considering that the passage focuses on a conversation about desperate decisions made for those they love, and the close relationship between Sam and Dean, it is reasonable to assume that after Dean leaves, he will mourn Sam's death as option (d) suggests. The passage may also imply that Dean could perceive the futility of any deals to save Sam, drawing a parallel to Evan's situation with his wife."},{"instruction":"A friend asked me to answer this question: Where would George and Helene go to leave messages for each other?, using the article: A common convention in the early decades of newspaper and magazine film reviews was to describe in the write-up the entire storyline including, in a substantial number of instances, the ending, thus unintentionally enabling subsequent generations of readers to reconstruct a lost film's contents. True to form, those who evaluated Seven Faces, such as Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times, did go into considerable detail regarding plot twists, as related herein below.Papa Chibou, the elderly caretaker of Musée Pratouchy, a Parisian wax museum, feels a strong kinship with the figures, particularly with that of Napoleon. He spots at the waxworks a romantic young couple, Georges, a lawyer, and Helene, the daughter of a stern judge who disapproves of his daughter's choice and forbids her to see Georges. Papa Chibou suggests to them that they can still stay in touch, without disobeying her father's directive not to speak with each other, by placing secret personal messages in the pockets of Napoleon's uniform.

What is the title of this article: During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Eisenhower's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat, as military priorities diminished; many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs. He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing, and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower, then a journalist at the Agriculture Department, he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

I read this background article the other day: Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel.  I am facing a new situation today: Jim and Robert are identical twins both getting their yearly physical check ups at the doctor's office.

Tobacco smoke contributes to cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. 2. Jim and Robert are identical twins who have the same diet, exercise the same amount, and were raised in the same environment. The only significant difference between them is their smoking habits. 3. Jim has smoked tobacco frequently for several years, exposing himself to the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke that can cause cancer, as mentioned in the background article. 4.

Please answer the following question: This article: Sir Richard Starkey  (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.  He also narrated the first two series of the children's television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed \\"Mr... contains an answer for the question: What is the better-known name of the person who sang lead vocals on \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\"?, what is it ?

This is a correct answer to the following question about Standard deviation. Yes or no? Answer: In science, researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that fall far outside the range of standard deviation are considered statistically significant – normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variation. Question: what is standard deviation in statistics Answer:","output":"Yes, the given answer is a correct explanation for the standard deviation in the context of scientific research. To make it more comprehensive, let me further explain what standard deviation is in general. Standard deviation in statistics is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It indicates the average distance of individual data points from the mean of the data set. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out. It helps us understand how data is distributed around the mean, and it is commonly used in various fields, including science and finance. In scientific research, as mentioned in the answer, standard deviation helps researchers differentiate normal random error or variation in measurements from causal variation, which is crucial for determining the statistical significance of results. By considering effects far outside the range of standard deviation, researchers can minimize the chances of attributing a result to random error or chance rather than an actual cause."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920.

Make sweeping a game for kids. pick from the following. 1. Put clear tape around a tile for kids to collect dust towards. 2. Put colored tape around a tile for kids to collect dust towards.","output":"To make sweeping a game for kids, you can use the colored tape method. Below is a detailed and step-by-step approach to turn the mundane task of sweeping into a fun activity for kids: 1. Choose the area: Identify an area in your home, preferably a floor with tiles, where dust and dirt tend to accumulate quickly. This could be the living room, the hallway, or the kitchen, depending on your home's layout. The area must also be safe and convenient for kids to move around without any potential hazards. 2. Gather materials: The materials you need to make this game are easily accessible and inexpensive. These include:     a. A broom or child-sized broom suitable for kids' use     b. A dustpan     c. Different-colored adhesive tapes (make sure they are easy to remove from the floor) 3. Preparing the colored tape shapes: Cut several pieces of each colored tape and create different shapes (such as squares, circles, or triangles) with each color. The shapes should be large enough to collect dust towards them, approximately 8-10 inches in size. 4. Arrange the shapes: Stick the colored shapes on the floor tiles, forming a random pattern. Ensure there are enough shapes spread across the sweeping area to make it interesting and achievable for kids. 5. Explain the game: Gather the kids and introduce them to the game. Explain the rules and assign a point system; for example, for each shape that gets completely filled with dust, the child can earn a point. You could also assign different points based on the colors or difficulty levels of the shapes available. Encourage teamwork or friendly competition. 6. Start the game: Distribute the brooms and dustpans among the kids. Let them start sweeping the dust, dirt, or other debris towards the colored tape shapes. Encourage them to fill each shape fully to earn the most points. Ensure you are present to supervise and guide them as they play. 7. Praise and reward: As the children fill up the shapes, praise their efforts and record their points. Keep the atmosphere positive and encouraging. Once they've completed the game, help them count their points and reward them with small treats or experiences, such as an extra 30 minutes of playtime, a special dessert, or a small toy. 8. Clean up: After the game is over, help the kids learn the importance of cleaning up by involving them in picking up dust using the dustpan and disposing of it in the trash bin. Also, remove the colored tape shapes from the floor. Making sweeping into a game engages children in a fun way and teaches them the value of cleanliness and teamwork. The colored tape method motivates kids to sweep by giving them visual targets to aim for, allowing them to see their progress and creating a sense of achievement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Furthermore, all tourism-related activities must be organized through one of the several state-owned tourism bureaus, such as Korea International Travel Company (KITC), Korean International Sports Travel Company (KISTC), Korean International Taekwondo Tourism Company (KITTC), or Korean International Youth Travel Company (KIYTC).  Traveling to North Korea as a tourist involves a highly regulated and structured process. Tourists are generally required to be part of guided group tours led by North Korean guides who monitor and control the group's movements throughout the country. Independent travel is not permitted, and tourists have limited interaction with local North Koreans. The itineraries and sightseeing destinations are usually predetermined and strictly controlled by the authorities to showcase the best aspects of the country and maintain a positive image. There are some restrictions on who can visit North Korea as a tourist. For instance, tourists from South Korea are not allowed to enter the country, and US citizens may face additional complications due to travel restrictions imposed by the US government. Despite the strict controls and limitations, tourists who visit North Korea can get a unique glimpse into an isolated and enigmatic country. Popular tourist attractions include the capital city of Pyongyang, the demilitarized zone (DMZ) at the border with South Korea, the ancient city of Kaesong, and Mount Paektu, a significant cultural symbol in both North and South Korea. In conclusion, while it is possible to visit North Korea as a tourist, one must be aware of the strict regulations and controlled environment in the country. Tourism is allowed, but it is limited and organized through state-owned tourism bureaus to ensure compliance with North Korean government policies and guidelines."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – Generally speaking, sociologists find that people in relationships tend to be happier and more satisfied than single people. But a new study makes clear that for some, being single is the way to be. It all depends on how individuals deal with conflict in relationships—those who hate it and try to avoid it at all costs report being just as happy when they're single as people in committed relationships, the New Zealand researchers write at EurekaAlert. In researcher-speak, such people have high \\"avoidance social goals,\\" and when they're in relationships, they often end up being miserable. “It’s a well-documented finding that single people tend to be less happy compared to those in a relationship, but that may not be true for everyone,” says lead researcher Yuthika Girme of the University of Auckland. Her survey involved more than 4,000 people age 18 to 94. The results show that \\"you can never say one size fits all,\\" a George Mason professor not involved with the study tells HealthDay. But before singles start exulting in I-told-you-sos, he adds that people who can't deal with conflict tend to be a little neurotic and might benefit from counseling. Such studies are important as the number of single people rises, notes Discovery, which says 51% of adult Americans fall in the bucket. It cites previous research showing that people who have a strong fear of being alone often end up in lousy relationships, too. \\"Taken together, these studies suggest that not everyone is cut out for relationships,\\" writes Talal al-Khatib. \\"The single life isn’t so bad after all.\\" (Another study finds that for those with depression, having happy friends helps.)","output":"Title: Single Life vs. Committed Relationships: Happiness Depends on Conflict Management Introduction: Conventional wisdom suggests that people who are in committed relationships are generally happier than those who are single. However, a recent study from New Zealand indicates that this may not always be the case, and individual happiness might depend on how one deals with conflict in relationships. People who hate conflict and avoid it at all costs are found to be just as happy when they're single as those in committed relationships. Main Body: Researchers from the University of Auckland conducted a study involving over 4,000 individuals aged between 18 and 94. The new study aimed at understanding happiness in relationships based on how people deal with conflicts. The researchers classified people with high \\"avoidance social goals\\" as individuals who dislike and try to avoid conflicts in relationships.  Yuthika Girme, the lead researcher, noted that despite the well-documented finding that single people are generally less happy than those in relationships, it may not be true for everyone. According to the study, people with high avoidance social goals are found to be just as happy when they are single as those who are in committed relationships. This observation suggests that the conventional idea of a one-size-fits-all approach to happiness derived from relationships is flawed. A professor from George Mason University, who wasn’t involved in the study, commented on the findings, stating that people who cannot deal with conflict tend to be neurotic and might benefit from counseling. It is essential to note that as the number of single people is on the rise, with 51% of adult Americans being single, such research becomes crucial in understanding the factors affecting happiness and relationship satisfaction. Additionally, previous studies have shown that people with a strong fear of being alone often end up in subpar relationships. When combined with the current research, these findings suggest that not everyone might be suitable for relationships, and being single does not necessarily lead to unhappiness.  Conclusion: In conclusion, the study from New Zealand demonstrates that individual happiness in regard to relationships is significantly influenced by how people handle conflicts. For those who avoid conflict at all costs, being single can be just as satisfying as being in a committed relationship. This research underscores the importance of not generalizing happiness and relationship satisfaction and considering individual differences when assessing the quality of relationships. Ultimately, the single life might not be as detrimental to one's happiness as previously thought."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Information:  - A general election was held in the Northern Territory on Saturday June 7 , 1980 . It was the first to be held since self - government was attained two years earlier , and was won by the incumbent Country Liberal Party ( CLP ) under Chief Minister Paul Everingham . Although the CLP 's share of the vote increased by almost 10 percentage points , it lost one seat . The only independent member of the Legislative Assembly , Dawn Lawrie , retained her seat of Nightcliff .  - Paul Anthony Edward Everingham AO (born 4 February 1943) was the head of government of the Northern Territory from 1977 to 1984, serving as the second and last Majority Leader (19771978) and the first Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 1978 to 1984.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is the head of government of the Northern Territory. The office is the equivalent of a State Premier.  When the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was created in 1974, the head of government was officially known as Majority Leader. This title was used in the first parliament (19741977) and the first eighteen months of the second. When self-government was granted the Northern Territory in 1978, the title of the head of government became Chief Minister.    What is the relationship between 'northern territory general election' and 'chief minister of the northern territory'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between the 'Northern Territory general election' and the 'Chief Minister of the Northern Territory' lies in the fact that the general election determines who will be the head of the government of the Northern Territory, which is the Chief Minister. The Northern Territory general election is a democratic process whereby eligible voters in the Northern Territory cast their votes to choose members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) are elected to represent the constituents of their respective electorates. The political party or coalition that wins the majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly forms the government, and the leader of that party becomes the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. In the context of the information provided, the general election held on June 7, 1980, was significant as it was the first to be held since self-government was achieved two years prior. The incumbent Country Liberal Party (CLP) won the election under the leadership of Chief Minister Paul Everingham, who served as the second and last Majority Leader and then became the first Chief Minister of the Northern Territory when self-government was granted. Therefore, the Northern Territory general election and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory are related as the election serves as a mechanism for the citizens of the territory to select their representatives in the Legislative Assembly and, subsequently, determine the head of government—the Chief Minister—who leads the territory and makes crucial decisions on behalf of its citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

We have: -39 * p + 157 = 118 + 546 First, let's combine the numbers on the right side of the equation: 118 + 546 = 664 Now our equation looks like this: -39 * p + 157 = 664 Next, we want to move 157 from the left side to the right side. To do that, we need to subtract 157 from both sides of the equation.  When we subtract 157 from the left side, we're left with: -39 * p When we subtract 157 from the right side, we get: 664 - 157 = 507 So, now our equation looks like this: -39 * p = 507 Now, to find the value of \\"p\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by -39.

Passage 1:Rafael \\"Rafi\\" Eitan (; 23 November 1926 – 23 March 2019) was an Israeli politician and intelligence officer. He also led Gil and served as Minister of Senior Citizens. He was in charge of the Mossad operation that led to the arrest of Adolf Eichmann. He served as an advisor on terrorism to Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and in 1981 he was appointed to head the Bureau of Scientific Relations, then an intelligence entity on par with Mossad, Aman and Shabak. Eitan assumed responsibility for and resigned over the Jonathan Pollard affair, and the Bureau was disbanded. He was subject to an arrest warrant issued by the United States FBI. From 1985 until 1993, he was head of the government's Chemicals company, which was expanded under his leadership. After 1993, he became a businessman, noted for several large scale agricultural and construction ventures in Cuba. He was the chairman of the Vetek (Seniority) Association – the Senior Citizens Movement.  Passage 2:In January 1996 former National Geographic photographer Charles O'Rear was on his way from his home in St. Helena, California, in the Napa Valley north of San Francisco, to visit his girlfriend, Daphne Irwin (whom he later married), in the city, as he did every Friday afternoon. He was working with Irwin on a book about the wine country. He was particularly alert for a photo opportunity that day, since a storm had just passed over and other recent winter rains had left the area especially green. Driving along the Sonoma Highway (California State Route 12 and 121) he saw the hill, free of the vineyards that normally covered the area; they had been pulled out a few years earlier following a phylloxera infestation. \\"There it was! My God, the grass is perfect! It's green! The sun is out; there's some clouds,\\" he remembered thinking. He stopped somewhere near the Napa–Sonoma county line and pulled off the road to set his Mamiya RZ67 medium-format camera on a tripod, choosing Fujifilm's Velvia, a film often used among nature photographers and known to saturate some colors. O'Rear credits that combination of camera and film for the success of the image. \\"It made the difference and, I think, helped the 'Bliss' photograph stand out even more,\\" he said. \\"I think that if I had shot it with 35 mm, it would not have nearly the same effect.\\" While he was setting up his camera, he said it was possible that the clouds in the picture came in. \\"Everything was changing so quickly at that time.\\" He took four shots and got back into his truck. According to O'Rear, the image was not digitally enhanced or manipulated in any way.  Passage 3:In 1998, one week after winning E3 Harelbeke and the Brabantse Pijl in the same weekend, he won the Tour of Flanders, thereby equaling the race's record of three wins. One week later, Museeuw made a horrific fall in Paris–Roubaix on the Trouée d'Arenberg cobbled sector, leaving his kneeknap shattered. On top came a dangerous gangrene infection which nearly forced doctors to amputate his left leg. He fought back and resumed cycling after a long healing process, finishing third in the Tour of Flanders of 1999 and ninth in Paris–Roubaix, exactly one year after his horror crash. In 2000 he won Paris–Roubaix a second time after a 44 km solo. Upon crossing the finish line in victory, he lifted his left leg, pointing to his knee as a reminder of the injury that had almost ended his career two years before. Later that year, he was again injured in a motor cycle accident, causing a severe head trauma and several days in a coma. His dogged determination and powerful riding style won him legions of fans all over the world and made him all the more popular in his native Flanders.

Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which continent used more chlorine gasses?  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, the Big continent used more air polluting substances, including chlorine gases. This conclusion can be derived from the fact that the Big continent experienced a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions. The hint mentions that chlorine and bromine gases are chief culprits in the destruction of the ozone layer, which is being destroyed by air pollution. The ozone hole has been associated with an increase in UV radiation reaching the Earth, resulting in adverse effects on humans, marine life, and the environment as a whole. Given that the Small continent was very protective towards the environment and did not experience the negative consequences faced by the Big continent, it can be inferred that the Small continent used fewer air polluting substances, including chlorine gases. Therefore, it is evident that the Big continent used more chlorine gases, which contributed to the destruction of the ozone layer and the subsequent formation of a hole in the ozone layer over the continent. This harmful activity highlights the necessity for the consistent implementation of restrictions on pollutants to mitigate further damage to the ozone layer and preserve the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor. and Daniel Martin. David Cameron today vowed to 'challenge the extremist narrative' of some Islamic organisations as he ordered an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood to check whether it is planning attacks in the Middle East from Britain. The Prime Minister said he wanted to establish a 'complete picture' of the group's 'philosophy and activities', with information being gathered by both MI5 and MI6. The review was prompted by evidence received by the Government that Brotherhood leaders met in London last year to plot their response to events in Egypt. Prime Minister David Cameron addressed reporters at a press conference alongside Italian PM Matteo Renzi. Speaking at a No 10 news conference, Mr Cameron said that the Government was committed to encouraging people away from the path of extremism. 'We want to challenge the extremist narrative that some Islamist organisations have put out,' he told reporters following talks with new Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi. 'What I think is important about the Muslim Brotherhood is that we understand what this organisation is, what it stands for, what its beliefs are in terms of the path of extremism and violent extremism, what its connections are with other groups, what its presence is here in the United Kingdom. Our policies should be informed by a complete picture of that knowledge,' he said. 'It is an important piece of work because because we will only get our policy right if we fully understand the true nature of the organisation that we are dealing with.' Handshake: David Cameron, pictured with Mohammed Morsi - the Brotherhood chief who was elected president of Egypt then deposed last year. It was reported last night that the probe will include assessments from MI6, the foreign intelligence service, into whether the body was behind a spate of recent attacks in Egypt. The domestic intelligence service, MI5, will be asked to look into how many senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood are based in the UK. The inquiry will also look into claims that leaders of the organisation met in London late last year to decide its strategy. There are concerns that the capital is being used as a hub for its extremist activities. Mohammed Morsi, the Brotherhood chief who was elected president of Egypt then deposed last year, is in jail. Following the army-led coup in Egypt, some Brotherhood leaders are reported to have fled to London, and may be co-ordinating their next move from a flat in the north-west suburb of Cricklewood. The Prime Minister is understood to have come under pressure from Egypt and Saudi Arabia to ban the group, but this is unlikely to happen. Last night a spokesman for No 10 said: ‘The Prime Minister has commissioned an internal government review into the philosophy and activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Government’s policy towards the organisation.’ Unrest: Clashes have taken place in Cairo between riot police and those who support the Muslim Brotherhood and ousted President Mohamed Mursi. As part of the review MI6 will look into allegations the group was responsible for the murder of three tourists on a bus in Egypt in February and a series of other recent attacks. The Brotherhood is Egypt’s oldest and largest Islamist organisation and has inspired similar movements around the world with its political activism and charity work. Officials have said it is ‘possible but unlikely’ that the organisation will join the list of groups proscribed because of their links to terrorism. Last month 529 Brotherhood members were sentenced to death by a court in Cairo, as part of a crackdown on the group. Mr Cameron asked Sir John Jenkins, Britain’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, to report on the Brotherhood’s ‘philosophy and values and alleged connections with extremism and violence’ by the end of July. Sir Kim Darroch, the National Security Adviser, has already started work on the report. Egyptian relatives of supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi cry sitting outside the courthouse in the southern province of Minya after 529 Brotherhood members were sentenced to death. Protests: The ruling is an escalation of Egypt's crackdown on supporters of Morsi, who was removed in July. Officials from the Senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office have previously resisted attempts to ban the organisation, arguing that to hinder a body that was largely moderate would only strengthen support of extreme Islamists. The Muslim Brotherhood is Egypt's oldest and most established Islamist group, founded at a time when they wanted to rid the country of British influence. After success members began getting involved in the country's politics but its supporters have been forced underground for most of its. existence since its birth in 1928. The coup to remove Morse last year was, in their view, the latest in a. long line of attempts to eradicate political Islam. They have been further marginalised after the interim Egyptian government declared them a terrorist group and blamed them for a series of deadly attacks in the country. Thousands of members have been arrested, hundreds sentenced to death and the organisations headquarters trashed and burned to the ground. Members have fled - including to Britain. A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood said that it would co-operate with the Downing Street review. ‘It is a religious obligation for any Muslim Brotherhood member who lives whether in his homeland or any state to respect its system and laws,’ he told The Times. Kwasi Kwarteng, a Tory MP and member of the Conservative Middle East Council , said that the West had been blindsided by the group’s sudden emergence. ‘I saw how they won elections in Egypt and essentially they ran Egypt very much in a partisan manner. They are quite loose, so they will say different things at different people at different times to seem moderate. They are great masters of disguise. ‘I think people in the West can get very deluded about the nature of the Brotherhood. Certainly three years ago we thought they were going to be just another political party.’ London became known as Londonistan ten years ago due to the number of Islamic hate preachers in the capital. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, ordered an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood based on evidence that suggested the organization's leaders met in London in 2013 to plot their response to events in Egypt.

Witte was dispatched to make peace, negotiating the Treaty of Portsmouth . In 1905, there were naval mutinies at Sevastopol , Vladivostok, and Kronstadt, peaking in June with the mutiny aboard the battleship Potemkin.

Some sources claim over 2,000 sailors died in the suppression. The mutinies were disorganised and quickly crushed.

The Last King of Scotland is a 2006 historical drama film based on Giles Foden's novel \\"The Last King of Scotland\\" (1998), adapted by screenwriters Peter Morgan and Jeremy Brock, and directed by Kevin Macdonald. The film was a co-production between companies from the United Kingdom and Germany. Can we draw the following conclusion? Kevin Macdonald directed The Last King of Scotland in the United Kingdom.","output":"While it is accurate to say that Kevin Macdonald directed The Last King of Scotland, it is not entirely precise to conclude that he directed the film solely in the United Kingdom. The film, co-produced between British and German companies, tells the story of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin and intertwines both historical and fictional events. The film's narrative is based on the accounts of a fictional Scottish doctor, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, who served as Amin's personal physician. It is set primarily in Uganda, rather than in the UK. Considering the setting and plot, several filming locations were utilized during the production of the movie. It is crucial to note that many scenes were shot on location in Uganda and several other locations. The film used various spots in Uganda, including Entebbe Airport, State House in Entebbe, Mbarara (Western Uganda), Gulu, and Kampala. Apart from Uganda, the crew filmed in some parts of Southern Sudan and the United Kingdom, particularly in Scotland.  Macdonald's efforts to immerse the film in the Ugandan environment for authenticity contributed significantly to the movie's critical success. As a result, the film received numerous awards and nominations, including winning the Academy Award for Best Actor for Forest Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin. In conclusion, we can definitively say that Kevin Macdonald directed The Last King of Scotland, though it is not entirely accurate to state that he directed the film just in the United Kingdom. The movie's filming took place across multiple locations, including Uganda, Southern Sudan, and Scotland, in an effort to create a more authentic representation of the historical events and the lives of the characters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Leonard Tresilian wanted to leave his estate to? , can you please find it?   The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407, when John Crow owned Gyldiefords, the land that would eventually become Gilwell Park. Between 1407 and 1422, Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe, and the area became known as Gillrolfes, \\"Gill\\" being Old English for glen. Following Rolfe's death in 1422, different sections of the property came to be called \\"Great Gilwell\\" and \\"Little Gilwell\\". The two areas were named after the Old English \\"wella\\", or spring. A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since. Around this time, an adjoining 5.6 hectares (14 acres) property was purchased by Richard Osborne. In 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. Legend has it that in the early 16th century, King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward. Around 1736 the highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London.In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, and half of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence. Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, died young after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750 – c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many in percent from the census weren't Pacific islander?","output":"Title: Understanding the Percentage of People Who Were Not Pacific Islander in the Census Hello little friends! Today, we are going to talk about Census and Pacific Islanders.  First, let's learn what a \\"census\\" is. A census is like a big count of all the people who live in a place, like a city or a country. It helps the people in charge to make sure that everyone's needs are met and that there are enough things like schools, parks, hospitals and buses for everyone. Now let's see who are \\"Pacific Islanders.\\" They are people who originally come from the small islands in the big ocean called the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean has lots of beautiful islands with people who have their own language, culture, and traditions. So, our main question is: in the census, how many people in percent were not Pacific Islanders? To answer this question, we need to look at the numbers we have. Imagine you have a big cake with 100 slices, and each slice represents one percent. If we find out how many slices have Pacific Islanders, we can find out how many slices are left for people who are not Pacific Islanders. Now, let's say in the census, there were 2 slices with Pacific Islanders. So, out of 100 slices, if 2 slices are with Pacific Islanders, how many are left for people who are not Pacific Islanders?  To find out, we can count all the other slices: 3, 4, 5... all the way to 100. When we count them all, we find out that there are 98 slices left for people who are not Pacific Islanders. So, in this example, 98% of the people in the census were not Pacific Islanders. That's it, little friends! Just remember that in different places and different times, these numbers may change. So always check the latest data for the most accurate answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Summarize this article: When you're dressing out an elk, you've got to decide whether or not you want to take the bones with you. If you do, it helps to be close to camp, to make the moving process a lot easier. To start the process, you need to get the meat cooling down as quickly as possible by opening up the cavity and removing the internal organs. Elk are extremely heavy animals, making it difficult to drag a whole carcass back to camp, if you're in the back country. For this reason, it's common to just harvest the meat, leaving the bones and the guts in the field. This method is discussed in the following section. Start just below the sternum, where the layer of hide and muscle gives you the most space from the guts. Use one hand to pinch the hide and pull it up and away from the ribs, using your other hand to make a small incision with the knife just under the sternum. Make the cut shallow, but make sure it's deep enough to get through the hide and into the membrane below, which attaches to the tissue below. Listen for a whoosh of air or a hissing sound, which is a sign that you've punctured the stomach. If you have, this means you need to work very quickly to get the cavity open and get the stomach out of there, to avoid tainting the meat. It'll be fine as long as you work quickly and carefully, and rinse it off when you're finished. Elk hide is thick, and the muscle is thicker. Below that, you’re still not all the way to the organs, but the final layer separating them from your knife–and from spoiled meat–is a thin membrane, which you can feel for with your fingers. Pull upward, to separate the membrane, muscle, and hide from the organs and give your knife enough clearance to work. When you've got your fingers between the membrane and the muscle, you can pull the hide up and away, insert your knife, and work it down safely, knowing that you won't be cutting through into the guts. Be very careful of your fingers, working slowly and smoothly. Continue making your incision straight down the belly until you get just above the anus. You should stop when you can feel your knife touching the pelvis arch, the bone near the hips of the animal. If you've got a bull elk, cut around the penis, just deep enough to separate it from the skin. Do not cut the urethra that leads to the bladder or pull it loose. Instead, cut it free and let it hang. This and the bladder will all come out together later with the rest of the guts. You don’t need to worry about puncturing anything in the upper-half of the animal. The best tool for this job is a combination hunting saw and knife, like a Gerber E-Z saw. These are small, portable, and lightweight, making them ideal for backcountry work. Use the toothed edge to work in between the seam, where the ribs connect and close the chest cavity, then pull the ribcage apart to open up the interior and work. When you get to the top, it's also a good idea to go ahead and separate the wind-pipe at the neck. You can be sure that everything is separated on the inside and you can just start pulling things loose and discarding them (or saving what you want). There's no big secret to gutting the animal at this point–just start pulling the \\"train\\" loose and making small cuts along the abdominal walls to separate them, where they're attached, if necessary. Everything, for the most part, should come out in one big clump, which you can start piling between the animal's back legs as you work, being careful not to puncture anything. Don't cut through the intestines to separate them. The intestinal tract of the animal will probably still contain feces, which will spoil your meat. Pile the innards between the hind legs of the animal and move to the next step to separate them safely. Special care needs to be taken to avoid accidentally puncturing the intestines or the bladder, which will expose the meat to waste and spoilage. To do this, you'll need to split the pelvic arch and expose them more readily. Use the hacksaw or a hatchet to remove a chunk from the top of the pelvic bone and open up space to work the intestines free safely.  Insert your thumb into the anus and use the knife to cut around your thumb. You can use a zip-tie to secure it and keep any waste from coming out, then pull the intestines up and free from the inside of the carcass. A plastic plug called a \\"Butt Out\\" is also available to do this, if you're uncomfortable playing elk proctologist.. If you've left the penis intact, the bladder should now come loose easily, along with everything else. Be very careful not to let it split or pop as you're working. Handle it gently and you should be fine. The cavity will likely be fairly damp and bloody, but it should be starting to cool down efficiently at this point. Some hunters like to turn the carcass over to allow it to drain some, promoting drying and cooling more effectively. If it's possible, you can hang the carcass and rinse it out with clean water if you're close enough to camp to have some to spare. Elk are extremely heavy. Even if you’re very close to camp, it’s usually best to break it down some, separating the hindquarters from the torso, just under the ribs, making it easier to pack out. Alternatively, you can also separate the meat and leave the bones in the field. It won't take long.

Does unravel mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"To determine whether \\"unravel\\" means the same thing in these two sentences, let's analyze the context and usage in each case. 1. In the first sentence, \\"unravel\\" means to cause the thread or fabric of the tablecloth to come undone or fall apart, especially at the seam. The person is being warned not to damage the tablecloth by playing with its seam. In this context, \\"unravel\\" refers to physical damage or destruction of the material. 2. In the second sentence, \\"unravel\\" is used in the context of untangling the ball of wool. The cat played with the wool, causing it to become tangled and knotted, making it difficult for the mother to untangle. Again, the meaning is related to the manipulation and potential damage of the material. While the specific actions leading to the unraveling are different in each sentence, the core meaning remains the same: the process of undoing, loosening, or causing the threads of a material to come apart or become tangled.

Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains.

Girls love it when this happens. After you've texted her for a while and you think she's good enough friends with you, try to ask her who she likes.

If you are going to date this girl, make sure that she is someone with whom you actually want to spend a lot of time. It is easy to build up unrealistic fantasies in your head, but it isn't always easy to gauge whether you would truly be happy with someone. Try talking about what motivates her; by doing so, you will create a bond between you two. Ask her and some of your other friends if they would like to go somewhere such as the mall or movies. Eventually if you two are comfortable with each other you could ask her to hang out at your house with a group of people. A group of people will make it seem less awkward.

Global supply chain disruptions: The ongoing pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the global supply chain, affecting various industries, including automotive, semiconductors, and electronics. Japan is known for its manufacturing prowess, and the disruptions have made the procurement of raw materials and components challenging and costly, leading to a decline in confidence among big manufacturers. 2. Labor shortage: Japan has been facing a labor shortage due to its aging population and strict immigration policies. The pandemic has exacerbated this problem as companies struggle to hire skilled workers in a tight labor market. 3. Domestic energy crisis: Japan depends heavily on imports of energy resources, primarily oil and natural gas. The recent global energy crisis and increasing energy prices have raised concerns among manufacturers related to increased production costs, subsequently affecting their confidence. Impact on the Japanese Economy: The decline in confidence among Japan's big manufacturers may have several effects on the country's economy: 1. Lower economic growth: Lower confidence often translates into reduced spending by businesses, which in turn may result in slower economic growth. This decline in spending could also lead to reduced employment opportunities. 2. Increased vulnerability to external shocks: A weakened manufacturing sector may make the Japanese economy more susceptible to external economic threats, such as a slowdown in global demand or potential disruptions in trade relations with other countries. 3. Weaker consumer confidence: The manufacturing industry is a key sector in Japan's economy, and its weakness can negatively affect consumer confidence. If consumer confidence declines, it can result in reduced consumer spending, further affecting overall economic growth. Increased Capital Spending Plans among Big Manufacturers: Despite the decline in confidence, capital spending plans by big Japanese manufacturers have been revised upwards. This can be attributed to several factors: 1. Strategic investments: Manufacturers may be investing in cost reduction measures or technological advancements to address challenges such as global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and rising energy costs. 2. Government incentives: The Japanese government has implemented several policies, such as tax breaks and subsidies, to encourage domestic manufacturers to invest in expanding production capacity and modernizing facilities, thereby boosting capital spending plans. 3. Preparing for future growth: Manufacturers may anticipate an improvement in the global economic situation, and as a preemptive measure, they choose to invest in expanding output capacity to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Conclusion: The deterioration in confidence among big manufacturers in Japan, as indicated by the recent BOJ tankan survey, highlights the challenges faced by the manufacturing sector during these uncertain times. Nevertheless, the upward revision in capital spending plans may signal continued investment in tackling these challenges and an optimistic outlook for future growth opportunities. Policymakers and businesses alike should pay close attention to these key indicators to ensure a quick and sustainable recovery for the Japanese economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, much of the continent is more than 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact. Now answer this question: How does the Arctic Ocean warm the Arctic?","output":"The Arctic Ocean warms the Arctic region through heat transfer mechanisms. Although it may seem counter-intuitive to think of the Arctic Ocean as being \\"warm,\\" especially considering its location at the North Pole, it is important to understand that it is often warmer than the atmospheric temperature above it particularly during the winter months. This relative warmth is linked to the specific heat capacity of water, which is high compared to most other substances, and thus water can store and transfer a large amount of thermal energy. This energy transmission occurs in the form of conduction, convection, and radiation. Let's discuss each process briefly. Conduction: When the ice layer atop the Arctic Ocean is in direct contact with the warmer ocean water beneath, heat is transferred from the warmer body, the ocean, to the colder one, the ice. This process, in which heat is transmitted through a solid or liquid by the direct contact of particles is known as conduction. This heat transfer through the ice diminishes the potential for extremely low temperatures in the Arctic regions. Convection: The ocean itself is also warmed by convection currents present within it. Warm water from equatorial regions travels towards the poles, releasing heat as it does so. Conversely, cold water from the polar regions travels towards the equator, absorbing heat along the way. This constant movement and heat exchange help to spread warmth even to the colder polar region. Radiation: Lastly, when the ocean  waters absorb solar heat during the summer months, due to lower albedo compared to ice, this heat is then slowly released back into the environment during the colder months, a phenomenon known as the \\"oceanic heat flux\\". This prevents the atmospheric temperature from falling to the extreme lows that are experienced in Antarctica. Keep in mind that the contribution of the Arctic Ocean's warmth is not large enough to make the Arctic a balmy region, but it diminishes the extremes of cold that might otherwise be experienced. This heat transfer mechanism is one key difference between the Arctic and Antarctica. Antarctica's lack of a comparable ocean-based heating system contributes to its much colder temperatures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: (CNN)Whitney Houston's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown was placed in a medically induced coma Saturday after being found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub full of water, a source close to the family has told CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. Brown, 21, \\"was not breathing\\" when a man identified as her husband and a friend found her at about 10:25 a.m. inside her townhouse in Roswell, Georgia, said police in the Atlanta suburb. They called 911 and performed CPR until public safety officers arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. Brown was taken to North Fulton Hospital, where \\"she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don't know her condition,\\" Holland said Saturday afternoon at a press briefing. Nobody knows what caused Brown's unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. Police had been to the residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, Holland told CNN. The police spokeswoman noted one oddity in the case: \\"Her mother died in the very same manner.\\" It was three years ago February 11 that Brown's mother, renowned singer Whitney Houston, was found dead -- in a bathtub -- in The Beverly Hilton, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammys bash there. An autopsy later revealed that she'd drowned facedown in \\"extremely hot water\\" about 12 inches deep. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled it an accidental drowning with the \\"effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use\\" being contributing factors. Brown is her only child. \\"She encourages me and inspires me,\\" Houston once said of her daughter. \\"When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, 'Okay. I can do this. I can do this.'\\" Brown was born in 1993 during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid-2000s reality show \\"Being Bobby Brown,\\" in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks. Mother and daughter even performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" in Central Park on ABC's \\"Good Morning America.\\" Given the pair's close relationship, it's no surprise that Houston's death was a major blow. Days after her mother's body was found, a grieving Bobbi Kristina -- then 18 -- was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she was \\"overwhelmed,\\" family friend Kim Burrell said. \\"She loves hard,\\" Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina. \\"She's going to be OK, and we're going to see to it.\\" Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime's brief reality show \\"The Houstons: On Our Own,\\" which followed life for the family after Houston's death. One of that reality show's storylines revolved around Brown's relationship with Nick Gordon, who lived with Houston and her daughter from the age of 12. Months later, Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon. And in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, presumably belonging to her and Gordon, along with the words, #HappilyMarriedâ€¢ SO#Inlove.\\"","output":"Whitney Houston's daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, was placed in a medically induced coma after being found unresponsive and facedown in a bathtub full of water at her townhouse in Roswell, Georgia.

It's a lesson that Papa John's executives and shareholders are learning the hard way.      \\"Very inexcusable and irresponsible comments\\" by company founder and former CEO John Schnatter caused same-store sales in July to plunge by about 10.5 percent, current CEO Steve Ritchie told analysts Tuesday in explaining the company's worse-than-expected performance during the the second quarter and drastically lowered sales forecasts for the year.      That's not going to improve any time soon. The company, which reported earnings after the market closed, lowered its outlook for comparable stores, saying executives now expect sales at stores open for at least a year to fall between 7 percent and 10 percent this year. Papa John's previously estimated that they wouldn't fall by more than 3 percent.      Its shares plummeted by almost 12 percent in aftermarket trading Tuesday. ||||| Despite its best efforts to rehabilitate its brand, Papa John's is still paying for offensive remarks made by its founder.      John Schnatter admitted last month to using the N-word on a conference call. He apologized and resigned as Papa John's chairman soon after Forbes published a story about the incident.      On Tuesday, the company said its same-store sales in North America fell 10.5% in July and 6.1% in the most recent quarter.      \\"Results have been challenged by recent events,\\" Steve Ritchie, president and CEO of Papa John's (PZZA), said in a statement. \\"Our entire leadership team understands the importance of getting our culture and business improvements right.\\"      Shares fell more than 10% after hours.      On a call with analysts, Ritchie said that Papa John's stakeholders agreed with the company to take Schnatter out of the public eye.      Related: Papa John's to pizza-eaters: We're listening      \\"I have spent a significant amount of time in recent weeks in the field, talking with our franchisees, our customers, our drivers and employees,\\" he said. \\"Franchisees and partners have expressed overwhelming support for ... our decision to remove John as brand spokesperson.\\"      \\"We are not dependent, nor should we be, on one person,\\" he said.      Days after the racial slur scandal broke, Papa John's announced that it would remove Schnatter's image from its marketing materials, where he featured prominently. A special committee of the board of directors will oversee an outside auditor's investigation into Papa John's culture, including the company's existing processes, policies and systems related to diversity and inclusion.      Ritchie said that Papa John's made the decision to distance itself from Schnatter after he said in November that the NFL protests hurt sales.      \\"The research and analysis we conducted after comments by our founder in November of 2017 have made it clear that we needed to move away from a founder-centric marketing plan,\\" Ritchie said. \\"Obviously, the recent events have further evidenced that we need to move on.\\"      Ritchie noted that comparable sales have slumped since November. Schnatter left the chief executive seat at his namesake company in December last year.      Related: Papa John sues Papa John's      But Schnatter, who said he regrets resigning from his post as chairman, isn't walking away without a fight. He remains on the board, and owns 29% of the company's stock.

The company said it was \\"saddened and disappointed\\" by the lawsuit, which it called \\"needless and wasteful.\\"      Schnatter expressed concern over the health of the company in a statement published on Tuesday.      \\"History shows that the Company performs better with me involved, and it declines when I step away,\\" he said.      — CNN's Jordan Valinsky and Jackie Wattles contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","output":"Papa John's is a pizza company that had some problems because the man who started it, John Schnatter, said some not nice words. This made a lot of people sad and they stopped buying pizzas from Papa John's. The people who work at Papa John's decided to not have John be the face of the company, but John is still a big part of the company since he owns a lot of it. They hope to make Papa John's better by changing some things in the company.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Record numbers of A-level students 'to be rejected from university' By Graeme Paton and Rachel Cooper Published: 10:00PM BST 26 Jun 2009 Research by The Daily Telegraph suggests demand for degree courses has surged by almost 65,000, even though few extra places are available. With the deadline for applications looming on Tuesday, numbers are believed to be up 11 per cent across Britain. The Conservatives warned a \\"major crisis\\" was looming as thousands more people push for university amid dire warnings of long-term job shortages. Vice-chancellors admitted entrance criteria would be dramatically tightened up, with the number of places handed out through clearing slumping to a new low. Many students missing conditional offers by a single grade, who would have been accepted in the past, could now be rejected, they said. More straight-A candidates will also miss out as the most sought-after universities fall back on interviews and entrance tests to find the best candidates. Universities have already been warned they face fines for over-recruiting this year. The pressure on places has been fuelled by a sharp rise in applications from mature students. Cambridge's four colleges which cater exclusively for over-21s all reported significant rises, with St Edmund's alone reporting a 52 per cent increase. But the Commons skills select committee warned this week that only 3,000 extra places across Britain would be made available in September - potentially leaving more than 60,000 without a place. This is on top of some 110,000 rejected every year after failing to meet entry requirements, applying too late or dropping out of the process. Amanda Brook, head of student recruitment at Exeter, said: \\"We have certainly had to reject more students who did not meet our AAA offers as we were only able to make offers at the very top of the range. Inevitably we will have to be stricter with those who miss their offer.\\" Professor Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of Bedfordshire University, said: \\"We could see tens of thousands of students missing out on a place at their preferred university because they have missed their offer by one or two grades. Universities are going to be more nervous about letting people in.\\" Roderick Smith, admissions director at Birmingham, said there was a nine per cent rise overall, including a 65 per cent rise in the number of students studying economics. \\"In previous years, about 80 per cent of applicants would have been made an offer for that subject, but now only half of applicants will be made an offer,\\" he said. \\"We are having to assess people much more rigorously because we know we can't take more people. We're looking for the best students, with the best academic record and the right combination of A-levels. We're most definitely having to reject people who in the past would have been made an offer.\\" The ultimate deadline for applications is the end of June. Last year, 588,689 people applied for full time undergraduate courses. After accounting for students failing to make the grade or rejecting offers, a total of 456,627 gained places. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) warned that applications were up by almost nine per cent by the end of March compared to the same period in 2008. But research by The Telegraph suggests numbers have surged further in the last three months. A survey of 50 institutions shows an average 11 per cent rise which would result in 64,755 extra applicants this year. The research covered a range of small, specialist universities, former polytechnics and elite institutions. It follows pressure from Labour on teenagers to go on to university in recent years, combined with the lack of unskilled jobs for school-leavers in recession. Ministers originally promised 10,000 additional places would be created this year. But Phil Willis, chairman of the Commons skills select committee, said only 3,000 would be available for full-time undergraduates. Other places are likely to go to part-time students, while money is also used by universities who over-recruited last year. Newer universities, many of which specialise in work-based courses leading directly to a job, experienced the biggest rises. Bedfordshire reported a 28 per cent increase and applications to Portsmouth were up 23 per cent. Buckinghamshire New University reported a 33 per cent rise. Popular universities, such as Exeter and Leicester, saw applications rise 18 per cent while Oxford increased by 12 per cent. Applications soared among mature students, many of whom have been left without work in the recession - potentially squeezing out those joining straight from school or college. Worcestershire University reported a 37 per cent increase in applications from mature students. David Willetts, the Conservative shadow skills secretary, said: \\"Photos on A-level results day of pretty young women jumping for joy after receiving their A-level results will probably be replaced the next day with pictures of the same people in tears because they can't get into university. We have a major crisis looming and we'll have many students with very good A-level grades missing out.\\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \\"Next year there will be more students going to university than ever before, taking advantage of the record number of funded places on offer. There will be 40,000 more accepted applicants than just three years ago – and right now there are 300,000 more students in system since 1997. \\"Getting a place at university has always been, and should be, a competitive process. But there are a variety of options on offer for young people, including part-time study, apprenticeships and foundation degrees.\\" Summary:","output":"A news article says that a lot of students who want to go to university might not get a chance because there are more people applying than there are spaces available. This means that some students who have good grades might still not be able to get in. Also, the universities are being very picky about who they let in because they don't want to have too many students. This problem is affecting students of all ages and might cause a big issue for everyone involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What does the shooting of the dog represent?\\" is in \\"The theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even though it is not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, \\"[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson .... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger.\\"\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"The shooting of the dog in Harper Lee's classic novel, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" is a metaphorical representation of the pervasive societal bias, prejudice, and racism in the town of Maycomb, as per literary scholar Carolyn Jones' interpretation.  In the storyline, it's not Atticus Finch, the protagonist's, duty to shoot the rabid dog, but he's compelled to do so as it poses danger. This reflects his role in Maycomb, a predominantly white southern town steeped in racist beliefs, where he's one of the few individuals willing to stand against prejudice and defend an African-American character, Tom Robinson. The dog is symbolic of the town’s irrational fear of African Americans, which, like the rabid dog, is seen as 'dangerous' and 'mad' without just cause.  Atticus's situation during this incident - being alone on a deserted street to confront the rabid dog - parallels his later encounters in the novel where he wrestles with overcoming the town's racial bias virtually single-handedly. This is seen when he stands up to a lynch mob aiming to harm Tom Robinson and during Robinson's court trial where he takes on the daunting task of sheltering Robinson from the town's prejudiced fury, all while being devoid of support from the town's other white citizens. The dreamlike imagery used in the novel by Harper Lee during the mad dog incident is also mirrored in the courtroom scenes, creating a tangible link between the two events, thus further drawing attention to the symbolism of the dog. Through Atticus's actions, his exposing of himself to the town's anger becomes a symbol for his confrontation of the town's deep-rooted bias and irrational racial fear. Conclusively, the shooting of the dog is a substantial symbol in the novel that reflects the dangerous strain of prejudice running through Maycomb. Atticus's confrontation with the dog is indicative of his struggle against the toxic racism of the town which denies the humanity of Tom Robinson, thus proving the \\"real mad dog\\" of Maycomb to be racial prejudice itself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When Brenda coated her wood panels with varnish, the concrete surface beneath got stained. The varnish protected and beautified the","output":"wood panels, but unfortunately, it left unsightly marks on the concrete. Determined to remedy the situation, she researched appropriate cleaning solutions and techniques for removing varnish stains from concrete surfaces. Step 1: Identify the type of varnish Brenda first needed to identify the type of varnish that was used on the wood panels. Depending on whether it was oil-based or water-based, the cleaning solution and process could vary. She referred to the product label and found that it was an oil-based varnish. Step 2: Gather the necessary cleaning supplies After determining the type of varnish, Brenda gathered the necessary cleaning supplies. For an oil-based varnish, she needed a paint thinner or mineral spirits, a soft-bristled scrub brush, a cloth or sponge, clean water, gloves, and safety goggles to protect her hands and eyes from any potential chemical contact. Step 3: Apply the paint thinner Wearing gloves and safety goggles, Brenda applied a small amount of paint thinner to the stained concrete area. She allowed it to sit for about 10-15 minutes, giving the paint thinner enough time to penetrate the varnish and soften it. Step 4: Scrub the stained area Next, Brenda started scrubbing the stained area using the soft-bristled brush. She was careful not to scrub too hard, as she didn't want to damage the concrete surface. She gradually applied more pressure as the varnish began to break down. Step 5: Rinse and repeat if necessary After scrubbing the area, Brenda rinsed it with clean water. She inspected the concrete surface, looking for any remaining varnish stains. If any stains persisted, she would repeat the process of applying paint thinner, waiting, and scrubbing until the stain was completely gone. Step 6: Dispose of the waste materials Once the varnish stains were successfully removed, Brenda disposed of the waste materials according to her local waste disposal regulations. She properly sealed the container with the used paint thinner and placed the soiled cloth and scrub brush in a sealed plastic bag, ensuring safe disposal. Step 7: Clean and dry the concrete surface Lastly, Brenda cleaned the concrete surface with a mild detergent and water to remove any residual paint thinner or debris. She then allowed the surface to air dry completely. Through diligent research and careful execution of the cleaning process, Brenda was able to successfully remove the varnish stains from the concrete surface. Now, the wood panels were protected and beautified by the varnish, and the concrete surface was stain-free and restored to its original appearance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Jets attempted to further their lead opening the third quarter, but were stopped short of the goal line and had to settle for a 21-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Dolphins tried to respond, but the Jets' defense forced their first takeaway of the season on the ensuing drive, an interception by Kerry Rhodes. Pennington led his offense downfield with the help of several Thomas Jones running plays before he ran into the end zone to give the Jets a 31-13 lead early in the fourth quarter. Miami would not go down quietly, however. Green quickly marched the Dolphins downfield to set up Brown's two-yard touchdown run. The Dolphins elected to attempt a two-point conversion to cut their deficit to ten; using a Statue of Liberty play, Brown walked into the end zone to complete the conversion. Although the Jets shed several minutes off the clock on their following possession, the Dolphins got the ball back and again were able to move swiftly downfield, where Brown scored his third touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Green. The Dolphins needed to recover an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff to have a chance to tie or win the game, but, despite a penalty moving the ball up ten yards, were unsuccessful, and Pennington knelt out the clock to give the Jets their first victory of the season.

Washington (CNN)New allegations have emerged from the man described as the 20th 9/11 hijacker, alleging members of the Saudi royal family supported al Qaeda. Zacarias Moussaoui, who pleaded guilty in 2005 to six terror-related charges, makes the allegations in a sworn statement contained in a brief submitted Tuesday as part of an ongoing civil case by the families of 9/11 victims. In the late 1990s, Moussaoui says, he was tasked by Osama bin Laden to create a digital database cataloging al Qaeda's donors. Every day for two or three months, he says, he entered names of the group's donors into a Toshiba computer, along with how much they gave. Moussaoui, who has been in U.S. custody for more than 13 years, said the list featured high-profile people, including several members of the Saudi Royal family, whom he named in his testimony. They include Prince Turki al-Faisal Al Saud, former director-general of Saudi Arabia's Foreign Intelligence Service and ambassador to the United States. Moussaoui, a French national, said he was chosen for the database job because of his education and ability to speak English. \\"Shaykh Osama wanted to keep a record who give money ... who is to be listened to or who contribute to -- to the jihad,\\" he said in sometimes stuttered answers. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims Moussaoui makes in his new testimony, which was made under oath as part of a brief filed in opposition to a motion to dismiss a case against Saudi Arabia for its alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks. Unlike a deposition, Moussaoui was not subjected to cross-examination by the defendants' lawyers. Moussaoui's credibility has been called into question before. And though Saudi Arabia's role in the attacks has long been a topic of suspicion, the 9/11 Commission's report, released in 2004, concluded there was no evidence the Saudi government funded al Qaeda. See also: ISIS captors 'didn't even have the Quran' \\"It does not appear that any government other than the Taliban financially supported al Qaeda before 9/11, although some governments may have contained al Qaeda sympathizers who turned a blind eye to al Qaeda's fund-raising activities,\\" the report said. \\"Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding, but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization.\\" Still, the report noted in parentheses, \\"This conclusion does not exclude the likelihood that charities with significant Saudi government sponsorship diverted funds to al Qaeda.\\" In a statement reacting to these latest allegations, the Saudi Embassy in Washington said, \\"There is no evidence to support Moussaoui's claim. The Sept. 11 attack has been the most intensely investigated crime in history and the findings show no involvement by the Saudi government or Saudi officials.\\" The Saudi statement also referred to the assessment of the 9/11 Commission. \\"Moussaoui is a deranged criminal whose own lawyers presented evidence that he was mentally incompetent. His words have no credibility,\\" the statement said. \\"(Moussaoui's) goal in making these statements only serves to get attention for himself and try to do what he could not do through acts of terrorism -- to undermine Saudi-U.S. relations.\\" Moussaoui's new sworn statements were taken in October at a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, where he has been held since his life sentence was handed down in 2006. Related: Saudi dilemma: How to spot potential terrorists. In them, Moussaoui goes on to say he met with members of the Saudi royal family in person more than once in Saudi Arabia, in order to hand-deliver letters to and from al Qaeda's notorious leader. \\"I was introduced as the messenger for Shaykh Osama bin Laden,\\" Moussaoui told attorneys on Oct. 21. \\"Did they treat you well during the [first] visit?\\" the lawyer asked. \\"Extremely well,\\" Moussaoui said. Moussaoui said he traveled on private jets and in limousines. His meetings took place in luxury hotels and even Saudi palaces. He was also given money for travel expenses at the Saudi Embassy in Islamabad, which he considered a bribe, he said. Furthermore, Moussaoui said his primary point of contact with the royal family was Prince Turki al-Faisal Al Saud, and that Turki introduced him to other prominent members of the family, including another former Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan. Tuesday's court filing also included statements by three members of the 9/11 Commission, former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, and former Sens. Bob Graham and Bob Kerrey. Their statements do not support the specific claims Moussaoui makes, but do say that further investigation of Saudi government involvement is necessary. \\"I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia,\\" Graham wrote. Kerrey told CNN on Friday that while he can't verify Moussaoui's specific allegations, he does believe the new information highlights the need for further investigation. \\"It deepens suspicions that everything about Saudi involvement is not as well-known as it should be,\\" he said. But this suspicion of the Saudi government is not shared by all. Robert Jordan, who was U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 2001 to 2003, told CNN he \\"was given no hint whatsoever of direct Saudi leadership involvement -- any financing or any planning -- for these attacks.\\" Jordan said he was regularly in touch with Robert Mueller and George Tenet, who led the FBI and CIA, respectively, and felt assured over the course of their investigation that allegations against the Saudi government were without merit. \\"A lot of it was my own questioning,\\" said Jordan.\\" 'Are you sure? Have you made certain that none of the people we're dealing with now at the senior level had anything to do with these attacks or with supporting the terrorists who financed and orchestrated them?' And I was routinely and universally given the information that they felt comfortable at least at the senior level they hadn't.\\" See also: Why Obama says fight with ISIS isn't a religious war. Moussaoui has made incriminating claims about the Saudi government before. Last November, he said that Saudi Embassy officials were involved in a plot to shoot down Air Force One \\"to assassinate Bill Clinton and/or Hillary Clinton.\\" He also said at that time that he had met with a Saudi prince and princess in early 2001 when he was taking flying lessons in Norman, Oklahoma, and that she \\"gave me money.\\" Lawyers for the Saudi government denied those claims, saying pointedly, \\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had no role in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\\" And the Saudis are not the only ones who have refuted Moussaoui's account of the 9/11 plot. In 2006, Osama bin Laden released an audiotape in which he denied Moussaoui's assertion that he was supposed to strike the White House with a 747 on September 11, 2001. \\"I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers,\\" bin Laden said, referring to the 19 known hijackers, \\"and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission.\\" Many -- if not all -- of Moussaoui's statements over the years have been called into question. During his 2006 sentencing trial, an expert witness testified that Moussaoui suffered from delusional paranoid schizophrenia. He was prone to loud and disruptive outbursts during that trial, and guards testified he would sometimes make irrational claims to them. He has also asked for certain concessions in exchange for testimony, such as a warmer cell in a different unit of the supermax prison. Beyond his claims about the donor database, Moussaoui also says in this latest sworn statement that he was involved in a series of other plots against U.S. targets. Specifically, he says he was given explosives training to attack the U.S. Embassy in London with a truck bomb. \\"I conducted a trial test of explosives for bomb of 750 kilogram of ammonium nitrate,\\" he said. \\"The plot was agreed with Shaykh Osama bin Laden.\\" Moussaoui said his team in that plot included Richard Reid, known as \\"the shoe bomber,\\" who Moussaoui previously said was supposed to take part in the 9/11 attacks -- allegations that Reid has denied. The plot against the embassy in London was eventually canceled, Moussaoui said, and he was sent to Malaysia to explore the possibility of attacking the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. That plot was also canceled, Moussaoui told his attorneys, so he went to the U.S. to look into attacking Air Force One -- the plot he first revealed in November. \\"My plan was not to launch the attack,\\" he insisted in the statement. \\"It was only to see the feasibility of the attack.\\" CNN's Jennifer Rizzo, Deborah Feyerick and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Zacarias Moussaoui, who has been described as the 20th 9/11 hijacker, alleges that members of the Saudi royal family supported al Qaeda in a sworn statement submitted as part of an ongoing civil case filed by the families of the 9/11 victims.

Here is an article: When I first saw this offer from Republic Wireless, I rubbed my eyes and looked for an asterisk leading to fine print that detailed a huge catch. But Republic, a division of a telecom company called Bandwidth.com, delivers exactly what it advertises. It can do so because the handset technology is a curious hybrid: it uses Wi-Fi when the customer is in a Wi-Fi area and Sprint Nextel’s 3G network when it is not. The concept brings together the best of two worlds: the low cost of voice calls carried over the Internet and the convenience of making calls to any phone number using a major carrier’s cellular network when Wi-Fi isn’t available. In my own case, on a typical day, I use my mobile phone mostly when I’m not actually mobile: I’m either at home or at work, perfectly positioned to use Wi-Fi at both locations. And I don’t even use the phone as a phone all that much. I use it mainly for e-mail and texts, neither of which requires enough bandwidth to benefit from the power of the fastest data networks. If you walk into a Verizon Wireless store and buy an iPhone 5, you’ll pay 60 or more a month for an unlimited talk and texting plan, depending on the data allocation for Internet use that you select to go with it. Some of that monthly charge goes toward repaying the carrier for the discounted price that makes a 649 iPhone seem as if it costs only 200. But most of the charge is for gaining access to the carrier’s wireless network. “We were looking at a mobile industry that had begun to charge extraordinary amounts of money, and we saw an industry opportunity that everybody else was missing: Wi-Fi is the new mobile,” says David Morken, co-founder and chief executive of Bandwidth, based in Raleigh, N.C. Smartphone apps that offer voice calls using data plans, not minutes allocated for calls, are plentiful. Just last month, Facebook quietly added an option that lets users of the iPhone version of Facebook Messenger place free voice calls to other Messenger users. But using those apps to make a call means the recipient has to run the same app, an irksome requirement that never comes up when using phones alone. Republic buys access to Sprint’s network on a wholesale basis for calls made outside of Wi-Fi areas. Its business model assumes, however, that Wi-Fi carries the load a majority of the time its phones are used. The company says that its service, even at 19 a month, is a profitable operation on a per-customer basis. “We don’t have to force people, or even ask people, how to behave,” Mr. Morken says. “Over 60 percent of the time that the phone is being used, on average, our users are using Wi-Fi and that number is only going up.” Last month, I tested a Republic handset, a Motorola Defy XT. It’s a light smartphone with a small screen, acceptable sound quality and great battery life. Republic’s Web site gently warns against acting like a “data hog” and encourages its customers to “play nice and try to use Wi-Fi as much as you can.” But scolding isn’t needed: Wi-Fi is faster than 3G, so users have an incentive to opt for Wi-Fi wherever it is available. The Motorola handset is the only one now offered by Republic, and it costs 259. The phone runs an older version of Android, and it has some first-generation glitches, like losing a connection when a caller starts out on a Wi-Fi network and then leaves the coverage area. (With a click, the call is resumed using Sprint’s cellular network.) Today most Wi-Fi access requires a logon. But that shouldn’t prove a great inconvenience: you can simply set up the phone once with Wi-Fi at home, then once more at the office. At other locations, users can ignore Wi-Fi availability and use 3G instead. Mr. Morken says a solution to the Wi-Fi-to-cellular handoff problem has been worked out in the company’s lab, and should be available midyear. Later this year, he also expects to offer more handset models, including one at the high end; he says they will run the latest version of Android. Matt Carter, president of the Global Wholesale and Emerging Solutions division at Sprint, asserted that the company was happy to serve as Republic’s supplier. When I asked whether Republic’s Wi-Fi-centric model, with its drastically lower price to the consumer, would pose a serious threat to the incumbent carriers, including Sprint, he said, “If the world operated based on just economic decisions, people wouldn’t go buy the most expensive cars on the planet, right?” Mr. Carter listed reasons that most consumers would prefer the wireless service obtained directly from a major carrier: a wider range of devices and the convenience of placing a call without having to tinker with Wi-Fi setup. Republic “will resonate with a sliver of the marketplace,” Mr. Carter said. He compared wireless carriers to the major airline carriers, which still control a majority of the market despite low-priced upstarts like JetBlue or Southwest, which he described as appealing only to “a certain segment of the population.” Philip Cusick, a J.P. Morgan analyst who covers telecommunications, says he doesn’t expect a major shift of customers to Republic Wireless. The price difference isn’t as great as it first appears, he says, when one considers that 80 percent of customers of AT&T and Verizon are on family or employer-related discount plans. MR. MORKEN of Bandwidth.com says he knows that his company must lower the price of its handset — the industry rule-of-thumb for no-contract wireless services is that a simple handset cannot cost more than 99 and a smartphone, 149. But if Republic can offer me an Android phone with a generously sized screen for a reasonable price, I don’t see why, with Wi-Fi available at work and home, I should continue to pay an expensive-sports-car price for my wireless service. “There’s a reason why the carriers around the world don’t want you using Wi-Fi for voice and text,” Mr. Morken says. “You will soon realize you shouldn’t have to pay what you’re paying today.” Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University.

The chilling episode unraveled while Nicky was taking her children to school after purchasing the car from a private seller in Hampshire on Sunday. The Ford Focus was bought from an auction site, where the former owner had assured potential buyers that there were \\"lots of years left in it.\\" However, the events that unfolded Monday morning expressed a vastly different story, with the vehicle bursting into flames and causing a harrowing experience for the mother and her children. The terrifying situation was first detected when her son James, 14, noticed something alarming. \\"Mum, my feet are on fire!\\" he exclaimed. Upon hearing this, Nicky Keefe immediately pulled over and managed to evacuate her children from the burning car, narrowly escaping a disaster that could have had far more severe consequences. Emergency services were called to the scene, and the fire was eventually extinguished. As the investigation is still ongoing, it remains unclear as to what exactly caused the vehicle to catch fire. However, it is evident that the family had a narrow escape from an incident that could have cost their lives. This incident has led to rising concerns about the reliability of vehicles sold on auction sites and their safety, especially when purchased from private sellers. Without proper inspection and background checks, the hidden dangers of buying a used car are too often overlooked, putting the buyer and their family at risk. In light of this traumatizing event, it is crucial for consumers looking to purchase a car, especially from a private seller, to ensure a thorough inspection by a certified mechanic before completion. Additionally, checking the vehicle's history and any outstanding recalls can be key in preventing accidents and guaranteeing the long-term safety of both the driver and passengers. Moreover, it is essential for auction sites and online marketplaces to enforce stricter policies for vehicles being sold on their platforms, particularly when they boast statements such as \\"lots of years left in it.\\" The timely reaction and level-headedness of Nicky Keefe undoubtedly played a significant role in averting any serious harm to herself and her children.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: To grasp where this 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN is coming from consider this: Its final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second close-up, followed by another two-and-half-minute freeze frame of Ms. Streisand -- striking a Christ-like pose -- behind the closing credits. Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra's distinctive visage dead center, filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. That just might be some sort of cinematic record. Or think about this: The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars, yet, while Streisand's songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar Kris Kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs. Nor, though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties, do they actually sing a duet. Or consider this: Streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times, including taking credit for \\"musical concepts\\" and her wardrobe (from her closet) -- and she also allegedly wanted, but failed to get co-directing credit as well. One of her credits was as executive producer, with a producer credit going to her then-boyfriend and former hairdresser, Jon Peters. As such, Streisand controlled the final cut of the film, which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. What it doesn't explain is how come, given every opportunity to make The Great Diva look good, their efforts only make Streisand look bad. Even though this was one of Streisand's greatest box office hits, it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance. Anyway, moving the melodrama from Hollywood to the world of sex-drugs-and-rock'n'roll, Streisand plays Esther Hoffman, a pop singer on the road to stardom, who shares the fast lane for a while with Kristofferson's John Norman Howard, a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to Has-beenville. In the previous incarnations of the story, \\"Norman Maine\\" sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer \\"Vicky Lester\\" achieve her success. In the feminist seventies, Streisand & Co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man, so the trajectory is skewed; she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one; he's a burden she must endure in the name of love. As such, there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher, but almost ruthless, while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit. Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance, and oddly it serves his aimless, listless character well. Streisand, on the other hand, exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. Everything she does seems, if not too rehearsed, at least too controlled. Even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical. The two have no chemistry, making the central love affair totally unbelievable. You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence, though at age 34, Streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive. The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom. And, indeed, had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way, to make Streisand's character openly play an exploitive villain, the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist. But I guess the filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim; they don't seem to be aware just how cold-blooded and self absorbed she is. But sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points: note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio The Oreos. And the film makes a big deal of pointing out that Esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of Hoffman, yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from \\"Esther Blodgett\\" so that Streisand won't be burdened with a name that is too Jewish or too unattractive. So much for ethnic pride. The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary, so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie, with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees. And the film did serve its purpose, producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes (including the Oscar-winning \\"Evergreen\\" by Paul Williams and Streisand). But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be, a vanity project.","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer criticizes the 1976 version of \\"A Star is Born\\" for a number of reasons, focusing on the film's perceived overemphasis on Barbra Streisand, both in terms of screen time and control over the film's production. They argue that this focus on Streisand and her character, Esther Hoffman, detracts from the movie's central love story and makes Streisand's performance feel contrived and unnatural. Criticism is also directed towards Streisand's co-star, Kris Kristofferson, whose character is portrayed as being overshadowed by Streisand's, suppressing the development of his performance and their on-screen chemistry. The reviewer asserts that the film could have potentially been more successful if Streisand's character was portrayed in a more villainous light or if the relationship between the two main characters was explored more deeply. Additionally, the reviewer takes issue with certain aspects of the film they perceive as insincere or superficial, such as Streisand's on-screen choice to use her original name for the character, the lack of ethnic and cultural pride conveyed through the film's characters, and the modifications made to the character's original name from previous adaptations. Positive aspects of the film mentioned are the polished appearance and technical quality of the film as well as the soundtrack, which features notable songs like the Oscar-winning \\"Evergreen.\\" However, despite these positive elements, the overall sentiment presented in this review is negative, with the reviewer stating that the film ultimately comes across as a vanity project for Barbra Streisand, ultimately detracting from the story and its potential impact on the audience."},{"instruction":"Q: What are the three types of muscle tissue in the body?

Passage:Born in Bucharest, her parents were the writer Vasile Demetrius and his wife Antigona (née Rabinovici). Her beloved father had attended Saint Sava High School, where one of his classmates was Ion G. Duca, who would become Lucia's godfather. Her mother was a baptized Jew; she had numerous siblings and the family was very poor. She attended the elite Maria Brâncoveanu central school from 1921 to 1928; its director, to whom she grew close, was the widow of Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea. This was followed by the University of Bucharest, where she earned degrees in literature (1931) and philosophy (1932). A student at the Dramatic Arts Conservatory from 1928 to 1931, she had Ion Manolescu as a professor. She formed part of the Sburătorul literary circle.

The goal is to create a new list that contains all the elements of list 'A' except for the last 'i' elements. Here, 'i' will always be less than the length of the list 'A'. Let's break down the given example: Input: i = 2 A = ['7843', 'H', 'w', '1349', 't', 'V', 'd', '3641', 'J', 'X', 'n', '6153', 'A', 'm', '3785', '2849', 'E', 'C', 'A', '4077', '7695', '7111', 'a'] Steps to perform: 1. Calculate the length of the list 'A' (let's call it 'n' ). In this example, n = 23. 2. Calculate the index up to which we need to extract elements from 'A'. In this case, it is 'n-i'. Here, n=23 and i=2, so 23-2=21. So, we need to extract elements up to the index 21 (excluding the element at index 21). 3. Create a new list (let's call it 'B') by taking all the elements from 'A' up to the calculated index (21 in this case).  4. The resulting list 'B' will have all the elements except the last 'i' elements from list 'A'.

Summarize: So at least they could ask each other here - in the face of that horror, and a series of other recent atrocities in Beirut, in Iraq, and in the skies over the Sinai desert: \\"Can we put aside some of our differences and do better when we take on the extremists?\\" The most obvious progress, however fragile, was over Syria, described by French president Francois Hollande as \\"the greatest factory of terrorism the world has ever seen\\". For more than four years, Syria has been laid waste by a civil war of increasing savagery. Large areas have emptied of people, leaving ungoverned space for IS extremists to seize. So ending the war - somehow - is now even more imperative. President Vladimir Putin is key. Russia too is an IS victim now. So has he been brought closer to the US-led coalition, or they closer to him? Britain's Prime Minister, David Cameron, had face-to-face talks with Mr Putin. They did break down some of the profound differences between Russia and the West over that intractable Syrian civil war. Mr Cameron told President Putin Russian bombing of the moderate opposition in Syria was a \\"mistake\\". Then, after their talks, Mr Cameron said that was changing: \\"I think there are some signs, some signs, that they are focusing more on IS, but we need to see that continued. \\"The gap has been enormous between those of us who believe [Syria's President Bashar al-]Assad should go immediately and those, like President Putin, who have been supporting him, who continue to support him. I think everyone recognises the need for compromise.\\" The hope is that prospects for a peace process supervised by the United Nations are now improving, although substantial obstacles remain. The prize, of course, would be an eventual democratic settlement in Syria. At the G20, President Putin said Russia had changed tactics, focusing its bombing on IS, not on moderate opposition forces ranged against President Assad. Russia was actually starting to work with some of the Western-backed groups. The Russian President used his closing press conference to declare: \\"Currently, on the battlefield, we have established contact with a part of the armed Syrian opposition who have asked us not to strike territories under their control. \\"We have come to an agreement with them, and we are following it. In addition, when the armed opposition can actively fight terrorist groups, we are prepared to provide them with our air support\\". Western leaders will be keen to verify that. As for US President Barack Obama, he said the military coalition working with the US had taken territory back from IS and was denying them all-important space in which to train and to plot attacks. But President Obama again rejected committing substantial US ground forces, while arguing patience would be rewarded. \\"There will be an intensification of the strategy that we put forward, the strategy that is ultimately going to work, but, as as I said from the start, it is going to take time,\\" he said. More than that, President Obama stressed a world united against \\"the face of evil\\" would prevail. But I have to report, listening to him in Turkey, he was not sounding his usual confident self. It was more the uncertain commander-in-chief. \\"There are going to be some things we try that don't work, and some strategies that do, and when we find ones that do, we will double down on those,\\" he said. President Obama even downplayed what he called \\"modest\\" diplomatic progress on Syria. Still, the heads of government did agree on a range of measures, including to share intelligence better, as well as to strengthen aviation security. The trouble is they sorely need those improvements, after devastating failures that apparently made destroying the Russian airliner possible and let some of those who carried out the Paris attacks move around Europe unchecked. This was a G20 like no other. Summary:","output":"At the G20 summit in Turkey, world leaders discussed the necessity of setting aside some differences and uniting against the growing threat of extremism, particularly in light of recent terror attacks. Discussions focused on the Syrian crisis, with French president Francois Hollande describing the nation as \\"the greatest factory of terrorism the world has ever seen.\\" Leaders aimed to find common ground and compromise over the role of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, Russia's bombing campaign, and potential United Nations involvement in a peace process. While substantial obstacles remain, increased cooperation between countries and an intensified strategy against extremism were key outcomes of the summit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It names someone to serve as your agent. Choices:  (a). It also names another, more user-oriented person, e.g., your spouse, or the attorney you've charged with administering the care of this person. The purpose of an alive will is to affirm that you're responsible for the person's health and well-being.;  (b). It identifies your caregiver or another physician you can rely on to authorize the treatment.

Choose the right person for the responsibilities and it could be anyone from a minor to a marine general. Everyone in a medical setting should always know the purpose of the property.;","output":"(c). This person, often a spouse or family member, consults the information provided in the documents and makes decisions about your care. Learn the risks not having a living will. After understanding the purpose of a living will, the most logical next event would be choosing someone that will help make important decisions pertaining to your care, usually someone you trust and who knows your values and preferences. This person may be a spouse or a close family member. It is essential to provide this person with all the necessary information to make the most informed decisions possible.  Once you have chosen your representative, the next step is to become aware of the potential risks and consequences that can occur if you do not have a living will. Understanding these risks will help you make better decisions about what to include in your document and will underscore the importance of having a living will in the first place. The risks of not having a living will can include: 1. Prolonged suffering: Without clear instructions, you may receive unwanted medical treatment that prolongs your suffering or delays the dying process. 2. Family disputes: In the absence of a living will, family members may disagree on the appropriate course of action, which may cause emotional distress, tension, and possibly legal battles. 3. Compromised patient autonomy: Without a living will, medical professionals may have to make difficult decisions on your behalf, which might not explicitly align with your desires or preferences. 4. Financial burden: The cost of extended medical treatment, particularly in the case of life-support measures, could cause undue financial strain on your loved ones. To prevent these potential risks, it is essential to create a comprehensive and legally binding living will. Start by discussing your healthcare preferences with your appointed representative and your healthcare professionals. Additionally, research the laws governing living wills in your area, as the requirements may vary among countries or states. Once you have completed the living will, ensure that it is easily accessible to your medical representative and healthcare providers. It can also be helpful to provide copies to any relevant physicians, hospitals, or nursing homes that may be involved in your care. In summary, the most logical next event in creating a living will is selecting a trusted individual to help make important decisions on your behalf, followed by understanding the risks of not drafting a comprehensive and legally binding living will. This knowledge will guide your decision-making process and ensure that your healthcare preferences are adhered to when needed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At the turn of the millennium, an estimated 72% of people in Northern Ireland were classed as home owners, either outright or with a mortgage. Analysis by professional services firm PwC shows that by 2014 it had fallen to 65%. By 2025, the figures are expected to drop further to 59%. The flipside will see the private rental sector experience high growth. There is a general trend away from home ownership across the UK, but in Northern Ireland it is becoming more pronounced. PwC believes the reasons include relatively low levels of house building and \\"a lack of confidence in the market\\". PwC chief economist Esmond Birnie said: \\"Add a young and mobile workforce who often prefer high-quality rental apartments to purchasing terraced properties and we are seeing a generation that perceives private renting as a real option to property ownership.\\" Home ownership in London is currently around 46% and in ten years' time, PwC predicts it will have dropped to 40%.","output":"In a place called Northern Ireland, many people used to own their houses.

(March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In late 1944, the remnants of a platoon of German Panzergrenadiers from the GroÃdeutschland Division are caught in an ambush by American troops. In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right. As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Neumann reveals that Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about. Cpl. Baumann (Jason Flemyng) discovers a set of plans for the complex while Cpl. Ebert (Jack Davenport) finds a danger sign.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears.

A:","output":"A: The part of a neuron that contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles is known as the soma or cell body. The soma serves as the control center for the neuron, playing a vital role in maintaining the cell's structural integrity, regulating its function, and coordinating its metabolic processes. The nucleus, which is housed within the soma, is responsible for governing the cell's overall activities and for storing the genetic material necessary for the neuron to function. Contained within the nucleus, the cell's DNA is used to synthesize a variety of proteins that are essential for the neuron's structure and function. The nucleolus, a dense structure located within the nucleus, is where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is produced, a critical component in protein synthesis. Other important organelles found within the soma also play crucial roles in a neuron's function. These include: 1. Mitochondria: Often referred to as the cell's \\"powerhouse\\", these organelles produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary source of energy for various cellular processes. 2. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): The ER is an extensive network of membrane-enclosed sacs and tubules involved in the synthesis and processing of proteins and lipids. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) primarily aids in lipid synthesis and calcium storage, while the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), studded with ribosomes, is responsible for protein synthesis and processing. 3. Golgi Apparatus: This organelle is primarily involved in processing, modifying, and packaging proteins and lipids synthesized in the ER, before transporting them to their target destinations within or outside the cell. 4. Lysosomes and Peroxisomes: These digestive organelles degrade cellular waste materials, ingested pathogens, and old organelles to recycle their building blocks and maintain the cell's optimal functioning. 5. Cytoskeleton: Composed of various protein fibrils such as microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin filaments, the cytoskeleton provides structural support, helps maintain cell shape, and plays a critical role in intracellular transport and cell division. Overall, the soma or cell body is the central hub of the neuron, providing the necessary infrastructure for the cell's survival, compartmentalizing and coordinating metabolic processes, and facilitating communication with other neurons. Ultimately, the health and functionality of the neuron rely heavily on the integrity and efficiency of the complex assortment of organelles within its soma."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who began investigating the costs of the capitol project?  William H. Berry was elected in 1906, shortly after the dedication, to the office of State Treasurer on a reform \\"fusion ticket\\". Berry was the only Democrat elected to a statewide office from 1895 to 1934. His successful campaign was deemed by Governor Pennypacker to be \\"one of those freaks of ill fortune\\". Berry began investigating the costs of the capitol project and brought its 13 million pricetag to the attention of the public. Part of the reason for the discrepancy was Pennsylvania's \\"over-elaborate\\" and sometimes \\"unintelligible\\" method of \\"ordering and purchasing supplies, equipment [and] furnishings, commonly called the 'per-foot rule' \\". Because the methods of measuring under the \\"per-foot rule\\" were not rigorously enforced, furnishing could be, intentionally, overpriced by the supplier. For example, a flagpole installed on the capitol roof was priced at 850; Berry estimated the value of the pole to have been only 150. Other expenses included 1,619 for a 125 bootblack stand and 3,257 for a 325 \\"mahogany case in the Senate barber shop\\".Pennypacker tried to demonstrate that costs associated with the capitol were reasonable in comparison with similar notable structures.  He pointed out that the United States Capitol cost 18 million, but had \\"fifty-five less [rooms] than the Capitol at Harrisburg.\\" Pennypacker also showed how the New York State Capitol had cost 24 million, and was still unfinished. After an investigation, a total of five people, including Huston, were convicted, on December 18, 1908, and sentenced to two years in prison for \\"conspiring with State officials to defraud the State in the erection and furnishing of the Capitol.\\" The Superintendent of Public Ground and Buildings James Shumaker and Auditor General William P. Snyder were also convicted. Among the convicted, John H. Sanderson and William L. Mathues died before going to prison.

The original sentence says, \\"To feel emotion is a blessing to Kayla but the only emotion Rachel feels is hate.\\" Option 1: * Kayla likely hates getting along with others. This option doesn't seem to fit well with the original sentence. The original sentence implies that Kayla is open to feeling various emotions, and there's no indication as to whether she would hate getting along with others. Option 2: * Rachel likely hates getting along with others. This option aligns more closely with the original sentence. Since the only emotion Rachel feels is hate, it would make more sense for her to hate getting along with others.

He buys an air compressor so he can air clean all of the dust from his computer. The compressor forces high powered streams of air by compressing the air inside it then releasing it through a tube.  and a hint : Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern experimental science of chemistry. He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases.  Please answer this question : Will decreasing pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant increase or decrease its volume? The answer is:","output":"Decreasing the pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant will increase its volume. This relationship between pressure and volume is described by Boyle's Law, which states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. In an inverse relationship, as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. Applying this concept to Boyle's Law, if the pressure of a container of gas decreases, the volume of the gas will increase, assuming the temperature remains constant. When Aaron uses the air compressor to clean his computer, the air inside is compressed and then released through a tube as high powered streams of air.

This House believes that religious beliefs should override government laws What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"An argument in favor of the statement that religious beliefs should override government laws could be based upon the following points: Step 1: Establish the foundation of religious belief Since religious beliefs are often founded on an individual's spiritual and moral convictions, it can be argued that they represent the ultimate truth and guidance for human beings. This can be backed up by the fact that major world religions such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism have existed for centuries and continue to garner followers, implying that they carry some inherent value and wisdom. Step 2: Focus on ethical and moral guidance The argument can be made that the ethical and moral principles derived from religious beliefs provide a strong moral compass for many, guiding them towards virtuous behavior. In many instances, religious principles could be considered a higher authority than the government, especially when government laws may, on occasion, conflict with these morals. Step 3: Highlight subjective nature of law Emphasize that laws are created by people and are subject to change over time, whereas religious beliefs derive from divine or spiritual sources, which remain unchanging and constant. Given the impermanence and subjective nature of laws, individuals may find solace and clarity in the consistent nature of religious beliefs. Step 4: Point to historical examples Provide historical examples where following religious beliefs or principles led to positive change and moral progress. For example, the abolitionist movement in the United States, where many of its proponents, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe, based their opposition to slavery on religious convictions. This example highlights the potential for religious beliefs to serve as a catalyst for societal change and improvements, even when government laws might not align with these beliefs. Step 5: Address potential concerns about religious extremism Acknowledge that the idea of religious beliefs overriding government laws might raise concerns about religious extremism. However, argue that the majority of religious followers espouse moderation and peaceful coexistence. In this context, separating religion from radicalism is important for understanding the positive impact that adhering to religious beliefs can have on personal and societal ethics. In conclusion, one could argue that religious beliefs should override government laws based on their spiritual and moral foundation, historical examples of positive societal change, and the potential for providing a stable moral compass. However, it is important to address and navigate the potential negative implications of religious extremism in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Diplomacy is failing to protect the United States' trade secrets At the moment, hacking is top of mind for the American public, and companies are spending more on security than ever before. But has the problem gotten any better? Not quite. Last year the number of cyberespionage incidents confirmed by Verizon in its latest data breach investigations report increased to 548 from 511 the year prior. And even though research firm Gartner predicts that information security spending will grow this year to 76.9 billion from 71.1 billion a year ago—an 8.2% increase—the problem persists. State sponsored attackers continue to loot corporate networks for classified information, seeking commercial, military, and political advantage. Type of data stolen through cyberespionage.Courtesy of Verizon How has the U.S. handled this threat to its economic well-being? Back in Feb. 2013, President Barack Obama unveiled a plan to beat back cyberespionage. “Trade secret theft threatens American businesses, undermines national security, and places the security of the U.S. economy in jeopardy,” the administration’s strategy document said. “These acts also diminish U.S. export prospects around the globe and put American jobs at risk.” The plan laid out five ways the U.S. would counter industrial spying. They can be summed up as: The country has, to be sure, made progress in some of these areas. A recent executive order imbued the Treasury with the power to sanction “individuals or entities that engage in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities.” Congress has upped maximum penalties and fines for individuals found guilty of any kind of economic espionage by tenfold to 5 million (and 10 million for organizations). And the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been aggressively pursuing economic snoops. “The agency reported a 60 percent increase in trade secret investigations from 2009 through 2013,” as the New York Times points out. But even as the prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act have increased, the Justice Department has had difficulty indicting people for online theft of trade secrets. “During the first nine months of [2014], the Justice Department reported 20 new prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act — a 33 percent increase from 2013 — and several convictions,” writes Nicole Perlroth, “but only two of the indictments involved trade secrets theft via digital intrusions.” The two cases comprise last year’s indictment of five Chinese nationals for hacking and stealing secrets from various businesses such as Westinghouse and U.S. Steel, and the August indictment of another Chinese national, Su Bin, for doing the same to defense contractors such as Boeing. The U.S. has had no authority to extradite the former from China, while the latter awaits extradition in Canada. In its latest “301 report” on protecting intellectual property, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which negotiates on trade agreements with foreign governments, places China atop its “priority watch list” alongside nine other countries. Some of the countries—Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey—have remained on that list every year since the first report came out in 1989. It’s clear that diplomacy—the administration’s priority numero uno for combating digital economic espionage, and the approach with the best chance at success given the U.S.’s lack of enforcement authority abroad—has not been very successful to date. Cyberespionage is still on the rise, and the same countries appear to be to blame. It’s possible that the executive branch’s newly approved power to impose financial and travel sanctions on perpetrators may change the game. But that solution faces challenges, too. As Verizon’s report reveals, not knowing who’s behind a hacking remains a problem: “Two-thirds of the incidents in this pattern had no attacker-attribution information whatsoever,” the report says in the cyberespionage section. That’s a lot of whodunnit. For the time being, diplomacy will likely remain the U.S.’s best option in combatting cyberspies. That said: Without the requisite muscle or confidence in attribution, it’s bound to continue to be ineffectual. States will just continue to evade and parry accusations of hacking. “Conditions are likely to deteriorate,” the 301 report says, less than optimistically, “as long as those committing such thefts, and those benefitting, continue to operate with relative impunity.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Diplomacy has so far failed to protect the United States' trade secrets from cyberespionage, as state-sponsored attackers continue to target corporate networks for classified information. Despite increased information security spending and some progress in sanctioning malicious cyber activities, challenges in attribution and lack of enforcement authority abroad hinder diplomatic efforts to combat digital economic espionage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to sine and cosine, what is the third main function of trigonometry?","output":"The third main function of trigonometry is tangent.  Tangent, often abbreviated as \\"tan\\", is a primary function in trigonometry that, along with sine and cosine, forms the basis of all other trigonometric functions. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.  In mathematical notation, if we denote the angle as θ, the side opposite the angle as O, and the adjacent side as A, then we represent the tangent of an angle as: tan(θ) = O/A In simpler terms, the tangent of an angle is the slope of the line from the origin to the point on the unit circle at that angle. It's important to understand that the tangent function repeats its values every 180 degrees (or π radians), so the graph of the tangent function has asymptotes, or lines which the graph approaches but never touches, at every multiple of 90 degrees (or π/2 radians). The tangent function is unique in comparison to the sine and cosine functions because it isn't limited to values between -1 and 1. Instead, its range extends indefinitely in the positive and negative directions. A good way to remember the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent is through the acronym SOHCAHTOA, which stands for \\"sine equals opposite over hypotenuse, cosine equals adjacent over hypotenuse, and tangent equals opposite over adjacent.\\" It's important to note that tangent function also has a reciprocal function, called cotangent (often abbreviated as \\"cot\\"), which is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the side opposite the angle, or: cot(θ) = A/O These three functions - sine, cosine, and tangent - provide the foundation for many branches of mathematics, including calculus, vector analysis, and complex number theory, and have numerous applications in physics, engineering, computer science, and other fields that deal with wave patterns, cycles, and circular motion.

Her father, a disc jockey, often took his daughter to work with him to help choose records to play on the air. Womack was the second of two daughters. Womack released her self-titled debut album in May 1997, produced by Mark Wright. The album consisted of self-penned material as well as songs written by other artists, including Mark Chesnutt, Ricky Skaggs, and Sharon White. The first single, \\"Never Again, Again\\" made the country charts and playlists by March 1997, which led to the release of the album's second single, \\"The Fool\\" shortly afterward. More successful than her first single, \\"The Fool\\" reached the Top 5 on the Billboard Country chart that year. That year she won major awards from the country music community; Top New Female Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music Awards, Top Artist of the Year from Billboard Magazine, and was nominated for the Horizon award by the Country Music Association. Decca Nashville decided to close its doors in 1998, moving Womack to MCA Nashville Records that year.  In 1998, Womack released her second studio album, Some Things I Know, which was also produced by Wright. The album's first two singles, \\"A Little Past Little Rock\\" and \\"I'll Think of a Reason Later\\" both went to No. 2 on the Billboard Country Chart. Two additional singles, \\"(Now You See Me) Now You Don't\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" were released in 1999, and the album was certified Gold by the RIAA soon after.  That year, she also won Favorite Country New Artist from the American Music Awards. Womack also contributed her vocals to the songs \\"If You're Ever Down in Dallas\\" and \\"The Man Who Made Mama Cry\\" in collaboration with her ex-husband and musician, Jason Sellers. The material was promoted through shows through October to November before the birth of Womack's second child in January 1999.","output":"This text is about a lady named Womack who is a country music singer.

(CNN) -- With Walter White dead, fans everywhere are mourning, celebrating, tallying up bets and discussing what just happened. Was the series finale of \\"Breaking Bad\\" satisfying? Did it tie up all loose ends? Did the character you wanted to live survive and did the ones you wanted to die get their just deserts? Is it sending you back to the beginning to binge watch it all over again?  Just when it seemed Walt was heading out of his New Hampshire hideaway to exact revenge on Elliot and Gretchen Schwartz (for dismissing his involvement with Gray Matter Technologies in the episode previous), he pulled the first of several surprises of the evening. Instead of threatening to kill them outright, he asks them to set up a trust fund so that his children would benefit from the money he'd illegally amassed (presumably the goal of his entire meth enterprise to begin with).  Gretchen and Elliott of course are terrified by his sudden appearance in their ritzy new home, but had they been paying attention, they would have seen Walt waltz on in. His entrance is a bit ironic, considering their wealth and legitimacy is in some way a result of his earlier contributions. He's always been there, in the shadows, whether they acknowledged him or not.  Bryan Cranston, man of the moment  Walt wants them to \\"make it right,\\" but of course, he knows he can't trust them to take care of his kids on a handshake alone, so he brought backup -- two \\"hitmen\\" who shine sniper-style red lights on the Schwartzes to lend credibility to Walt's threat that if for any reason his children don't receive the money, \\"a kind of countdown begins,\\" in which they would be killed. It's a bluff, but they don't know that, so it's a win-win. Walt's children will get the money in a semi-legal fashion, and no one will actually die in the process.  1. Who is Bryan Cranston? 2.

The Piazza delle Erbe, also known as the Market Square, is one of the three significant and interconnected piazzas in San Gimignano, Italy. The other two piazzas mentioned here are the Piazza della Cisterna and the Piazza del Duomo. Each piazza serves a different purpose and is characterized by unique architectural and historical elements.  Piazza della Cisterna gets its name from a 13th-century travertine well and is surrounded by elegant palaces. This beautiful triangular square is a central meeting point for both tourists and locals. It represents the social and commercial heart of the city. Piazza del Duomo, the religious and civic center of power, houses both the church and town hall. The Duomo, also known as the Collegiate Church, is a fine example of Romanesque architecture, featuring beautiful frescoes and artworks. The town hall, on the other hand, represents the secular power and authority in the city. The Piazza delle Erbe was historically the place where local farmers and merchants would come together to trade and sell their goods, such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, and other necessities. The twin Salvucci towers stand tall within this piazza, making it easily recognizable. These two towers were initially constructed as a symbol of power and wealth by the Salvucci family, a prominent noble family in San Gimignano. All three piazzas are interconnected architecturally and historically, forming an essential part of San Gimignano's layout, cultural identity, and social fabric. The statement that \\"The Piazza delle Erbe is home to a marketplace and a pair of towers\\" is accurate, as the piazza is characterized by the presence of the market and the distinctive Salvucci towers that serve as a symbol of power and architecture worthy of this remarkable Tuscan town."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who sinks into a deep depression?  Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\".  Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone. They go for walks, drives, and tennis; he amuses her with jokes. Finally, at a restaurant she reaches for his hand and in doing so realizes she is falling for him. She quickly breaks away, and says she cannot see him any more. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who sinks into a deep depression is Lorna.

Q: Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed. Every time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it. And even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let’s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning. The principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state. Now on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick. Unquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place. Where the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The... According to the above context, answer the following question. After cooking vegetables, they are probably: The answer is:","output":"After cooking vegetables, they are probably experiencing some degree of nutrient loss due to exposure to heat, oxygen, or light. However, cooking also increases the digestibility of the vegetables, making it easier for our bodies to absorb the available nutrients. While some enzymes and nutrients may be lost during cooking, the availability of certain phytonutrients increases, and harmful microbes that can cause food poisoning are killed. Therefore, it's a trade-off between nutrient loss and increased digestibility and safety."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I asked Elsie for taster cups and she handed me 2 without a smile or any type of greeting. I sampled cheesecake and pistachio first and didn't want either.

The caramel corn refreshingly matched the taste of real caramel corn without being overly sweet and the chocolate didn't taste like a true chocolate. I decided on the caramel corn with white chocolates chips; sliced almonds; granola. I noticed the chocolate chips had a white coating and asked Elsie about it. She said it was probably a bad batch but they were still good. They still looked unappetizing and it made me question how fresh their other toppings are.

Those toe nails looked like they had been there for days and the entire time we were there she never cleaned them up.   It's too bad because I enjoyed my yogurt  enough to come back.","output":"The review appears to be predominantly negative. The reviewer acknowledges some positive aspects, such as the caramel corn yogurt flavor, but the overall sentiment leans towards dissatisfaction. The reviewer mentions several points of criticism: 1. The layout of the yogurt shop is described as generic, which may be perceived as uninspired or lacking in originality. 2. The reviewer did not find the cheesecake and pistachio flavors appealing, as they were deemed too sweet and too weak, respectively. 3. The staff member, Elsie, was portrayed as unenthusiastic and unhelpful. 4. The chocolate chips were criticized for their unappetizing appearance. 5. The presence of dirty toenails on the floor raised concerns about the overall cleanliness of the establishment. Additionally, the reviewer implies that Elsie offered excuses instead of an apology for the toenails' presence on the floor, and the problem was not resolved during their visit. This further contributes to the negative sentiment of the review. Despite the reviewer stating that they enjoyed the caramel corn yogurt enough to potentially come back, the negative aspects highlighted are likely to overshadow the positive elements and discourage them from becoming a repeat customer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A) went to see a friend B) felt very tired C) wasn't feeling well D) went to help his doctor Answer:","output":"One day an Indian (C) wasn't feeling well. He decided it was time to go see his doctor to seek advice and possible treatment to alleviate his symptoms. Upon arrival, he was examined by the doctor, who concluded that medication was not the solution to the man's issues. The doctor recommended that the Indian take a change of pace for his overall wellbeing. Specifically, the doctor instructed him to go to a serene country location for one month, establish a healthier bedtime routine, consume milk, engage in regular exercise through walking, and limit himself to only one cigar each day. The Indian, trusting the expertise of his doctor, took the advice to heart and followed through with the recommendations. A month later, he returned to see the doctor, who was pleased to observe the visible improvement in the man's physical appearance. The Indian seemed rejuvenated, which the doctor attributed to the implemented lifestyle changes. The Indian confirmed this by expressing his gratitude and sharing that he had indeed experienced a restful period, established an early bedtime, drank copious amounts of milk, and walked frequently. However, the Indian also mentioned that the doctor's advice to smoke one cigar a day had proven to be a significant challenge initially. As a non-smoker, he found it difficult to adjust and adopt this habit, especially at his age. The doctor was surprised to hear this but was pleased with the overall results of his recommendations in improving the Indian's health and wellbeing. In conclusion, one day an Indian (C) wasn't feeling well and sought help from his doctor. Following the doctor's advice, the man experienced significant improvements in his health, despite the unexpected challenge of beginning to smoke cigars later in life. The experience underscores the importance of taking a holistic approach to health and acknowledging that making changes in multiple aspects of one's lifestyle can contribute to improved overall wellbeing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: measure the voltage  B: rewire the house  C: make the power Answer:","output":"A: measure the voltage Step 1: Analyze the context - In the context, Sasha has just finished rewiring the house for electricity and tested every outlet. Step 2: Anticipate the possible next tasks - After rewiring and testing all the outlets, Sasha might want to ensure that every outlet is working correctly and safely. Step 3: Evaluate each answer choice: A: measure the voltage - Measuring the voltage can help Sasha confirm that the outlets were wired correctly and can handle the electrical load they are supposed to.

Unlike ABC, CBS and NBC, Fox does not currently air national news programs (morning, evening or overnight) or newsmagazines -- choosing to focus solely on its prime time schedule, sports and other ancillary network programming. The absence of a national news program on the Fox network is despite the fact that its parent company, 21st Century Fox, owns Fox News Channel, which launched in August 1996 and currently maintains near-universal distribution within the United States via pay television providers. Fox News is not structured as a news division of the Fox network, and operates as a technically separate entity within 21st Century Fox through the company's Fox News Group subsidiary. However, it does produce some content that is carried by the broadcast network, which is usually separate from the news coverage aired by the cable channel; in particular, FNC anchor Shepard Smith anchors most prime time news presentations on the Fox network, especially during political news events (which are anchored by Bret Baier on Fox News Channel).

What is the name of the person Holly was asked to check on?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl, whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a Book of Mormon.  Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious street preacher lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the man—later identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)—to rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days.  In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly—a struggling actress—acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result. Elder Farrell promises that God will never stop loving her regardless of her mistakes. At a local ward luau, another missionary interviews Carl for baptism, teaching him the story of Ammon, a missionary who teaches a group of people  to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"The population of India in 1980 was approximately 683.3 million people, according to the World Bank. India has experienced rapid population growth over the past few decades, driven by factors such as higher fertility rates, improved health care, and economic development. As of 2021, the recent population of India is estimated to be around 1.366 billion people, making it the second most populous country in the world after China. It is projected that India may overtake China in terms of population within a few years. As for the two questions, they concern the population of India but refer to different time periods. The first question asks for the population in the year 1980, while the second question seeks information about the recent population of India. In this sense, the two questions are not the same, because they pertain to different data points of Indian population over time. It is important to understand the distinction between the two questions as it allows us to recognize the historic progress and demographic changes in India. While the specific population number may vary from year to year, studying the data from 1980 and comparing it to more recent statistics enables us to analyze the growth trend and the factors that have contributed to India's immense population increase in the past few decades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Product review: I don't see why they even bothered releasing this album. It was a complete waste of time seeing as how Jon Bonham died two years before and Robert and Jimi didn't like each other very much. I think this one didn't even go gold. Answer:","output":"Based on this particular review, the chances of me buying the product would likely decrease. However, it is essential to analyze the given review to understand the reasons behind this deduction.  Firstly, the review title \\"Your career is over, get over it!\\" telegraphs a strong negative sentiment which indicates that the reviewer was not happy or satisfied with the album. This negative perception from the reviewer instills a sense of doubt regarding the quality and the overall appeal of the product.  Next, the actual content of the product review highlights a few critical points. The reviewer states that they don't understand why the album was even released, claiming it to be a waste of time. This statement suggests that the reviewer believes that the album's content is not worth investing time or money in. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that Jon Bonham, a member of the band, passed away two years before the album's release, and the remaining members, Robert and Jimi, did not get along well. It could be inferred from this information that the group dynamics at the time of the recording might have compromised the quality and the cohesiveness of the music. Lastly, the reviewer mentions that the album didn't even go gold. This piece of information implies that the album did not receive substantial commercial success or positive critical reception. This lack of recognition and achievement again casts doubts on the album's overall quality and appeal to the listeners. However, it is always important to consider multiple perspectives before making a final decision. A single review may not accurately represent the collective opinion of the product's target audience. Therefore, one should read multiple reviews to gather a more balanced understanding of the product's pros and cons. Additionally, personal preferences and tastes play a significant role in determining whether a product will satisfy one's expectations. As such, you might still consider giving the album a listen or exploring further to make a well-informed decision about purchasing the product."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: Bad Ink, Waste of money Review: I just bought these thinking that these would work out fine.

What did John pull open? Options: - closet - chest - drawer - dresser - suitcase  The answer is \\"drawer\\" because A:","output":"The phrase \\"looking for a shirt, so he pulled open this\\" refers to an action where an item typically used for clothing storage was used. While it is true that a shirt can be stored in all the item options provided - a closet, a chest, a drawer, a dresser, or a suitcase - the use of the verb 'pulled open' provides the best clue in this situation. Let's examine each option more carefully: 1. Closet: In typical usage, a closet is not usually described as being 'pulled open'. Rather, closets are usually constructed with doors that swing open or slide side to side. As such, we often use the verbs 'open' or 'slide' to refer to accessing a closet. Therefore, the phrase \\"pulled open\\" doesn't match well with the use of a closet. 2. Chest: Chests can indeed be 'pulled open', but they are more often associated with larger items, keepsakes, or items not frequently accessed. While you can store clothes in a chest, it's less common to do so, especially for items like shirts that you would need to access frequently. 3. Drawer: Drawers are commonly 'pulled open', and in most home environments, shirts are commonly stored in dressers or chests of drawers. The pulling action matches the operation of most drawers, which are slid out (or pulled open) from a piece of furniture such as a dresser or a chest of drawers. 4. Dresser: Although a dresser may sound like a viable answer, we typically consider a dresser to be made up of multiple drawers. Therefore, we wouldn't generally say that we're 'pulling open' a dresser — instead, we pull open the drawers of a dresser. 5. Suitcase: While a suitcase can be 'pulled open', it is not a common place to store shirts, especially not in a home setting where other storage options, like drawers, are available. Usually, you keep clothes in a suitcase when you are traveling. In conclusion, considering the verb 'pulled open' and the context of looking for a shirt at presumably home, 'drawer' is the most fitting answer among the options given. Hence, the statement \\"John was looking for a shirt, so he pulled open this. What did John pull open?\\" is best answered with 'drawer'."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The most suitable option in this context would be a \\"stringed instrument.\\" This choice makes the most sense because the terms \\"neck\\" and \\"bridge\\" are commonly used to describe parts of a stringed instrument, such as a guitar, violin, or cello. The neck is the elongated, slender part of the instrument where the strings rest, while the bridge is a component that supports the strings and transfers their vibrations to the instrument's body. The act of \\"playing\\" further supports this option, as one can physically interact with and produce sound from a stringed instrument by plucking or bowing its strings. The other options do not fit the context as easily: - Tunnel: While one could admire the design or construction of a tunnel, there isn't a physical action comparable to \\"playing\\" involved in engaging with a tunnel.    - Transportation system: Similar to the tunnel, one can admire the function and design of a transportation system, but \\"playing\\" wouldn't be an appropriate way to interact with it. - Spectacles: Admiring spectacles refers to eyeglasses, and though one might appreciate the craftsmanship of a pair of glasses, \\"playing\\" them doesn't align with their purpose. - Radio: The act of playing a radio could refer to turning it on and listening to music or broadcasts.

It has an orbital period of 139705000.0 and an epoch date of December 31st 2006. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"Several important pieces of data about 109 Felicitas, a celestial object, can be extracted from the given sentence, and they are described as follows: 1. 109 Felicitas is the name of the celestial object being described. The number '109' implies that it is the 109th discovered object of its type, most likely an asteroid. The name 'Felicitas' signifies it has been named after a specific person, concept, or entity. 2. Periapsis: The sentence provides the periapsis of 109 Felicitas, which is 283,326,000,000.0 (283.326 billion). The periapsis refers to the point in the orbit of a celestial body where it is nearest to the body it is orbiting. The unit of measurement for this periapsis data, however, has not been provided in the sentence. In the case of an asteroid, the periapsis typically refers to its closest approach to the Sun in its orbit. 3. Apoapsis: The apoapsis of 109 Felicitas is given as 523,329,000 kilometers. Apoapsis is the point in the orbit of a celestial body where it is farthest from the body it is orbiting. For an asteroid, the apoapsis usually refers to its farthest distance from the Sun in its orbit. So, 109 Felicitas has an apoapsis distance of about 523.329 million kilometers away from the Sun at its farthest point. 4. Orbital period: The orbital period of 109 Felicitas is provided as 139,705,000.0 (139.705 million), but the unit of measurement is not specified. The orbital period refers to the time it takes for a celestial object to complete one full orbit around the body it's orbiting. In this case, it represents the time it takes 109 Felicitas to complete one full orbit around the Sun. Since the unit of measurement is not given, it leaves an uncertainty whether this number is in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. 5. Epoch date: The epoch date of December 31st, 2006 is mentioned, which represents a specific point in time used as a reference for calculating and describing the position and orbital elements of the celestial object. In the case of 109 Felicitas, this date is used as a reference for its orbital state at that particular time, and its current position and orbital elements can be computed based on the orbital data stated in the sentence. In summary, the extracted data from the sentence provides information about the periapsis, apoapsis, orbital period, and epoch date of a celestial object named 109 Felicitas. However, there is ambiguity regarding the units of measurement for the periapsis and orbital period in the given sentence. Still, this information helps to characterize the orbit and behavior of the celestial object."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  On the night of 6 November 1995, a fire broke out in the Rova compound, destroying or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly fit onto the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On the night of the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in the public square in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.The destruction of the Rova of Antananarivo occurred at a time when the complex was in the final stages of the process to become classified as Madagascar's first cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Six people were initially charged in connection with the Rova's destruction in an Antananarivo court of law, but the official investigation concluded that the fire was an accident. Public accusations of a cover-up placed the blame for the fire on government officials, various ethnic groups, foreign powers and other parties. Widespread belief persists within and outside Madagascar that a deliberate arson was the cause. Rumoured motivations for arson at the Rova were numerous and remain unproven. The revelation that important financial archives had been destroyed early on the morning of the fire sparked rumours that corrupt government officials had lit the blaze to create a public... The answer to this question is:","output":"The body found in the public square on the night of the fire was later identified as belonging to Queen Ranavalona III. A funeral vigil was held the following day for the royal remains. The remains have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga, which is a hill and traditional fortified royal settlement situated near Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. Ambohimanga is considered a significant spiritual and cultural site in the country and is often the location where Malagasy royalty is laid to rest.  The destruction of the Rova of Antananarivo was a significant event in Madagascar's history, and many suspicions and rumors still surround the cause of the fire. Despite the official investigation concluding that it was an accident, public speculation and mistrust has pointed towards various parties, including government officials, foreign powers, and other groups, potentially being responsible for the fire as an act of arson. This belief persists due to the potential motivations for arson at the Rova, including the destruction of important financial archives that could implicate corrupt government officials.  In conclusion, the person whose body was found in the public square, identified as Queen Ranavalona III, has been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga, a significant cultural and spiritual site near the capital of Antananarivo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Not far away, dust-covered penguins wander over chunks of concrete and other debris. This has been life at Japan's Inubosaki Marine Park Aquarium since January when its owner abandoned it, citing a decline in visitors.

This distressing scene has been the reality at Japan's now-abandoned Inubosaki Marine Park Aquarium since January, sparking outrage from animal rights activists and concerned citizens around the globe. The Abandoned Aquarium and Its Remaining Inhabitants The Inubosaki Marine Park Aquarium, located in Choshi, fell on hard times as visitor numbers dwindled. In January, the owner abandoned the facility, leaving behind Honey the dolphin, 46 penguins, and hundreds of fish and reptiles. According to Reuters, a few staff members have been returning to the abandoned park to feed the remaining animals, but their future remains uncertain. Growing Concerns and Public Outcry Animal rights activists and concerned citizens have made the desperate situation at the aquarium known, with over 1,400 letters penned to the town of Choshi, voicing their worries and pleading for help. The head of aquarium issues at the Animal Rights Centre Japan spoke to the Guardian, expressing concern that \\"Honey will die if this situation continues.\\" They added that the dolphin has been \\"repeating the same movements ... and is showing definite signs of stress.\\" Similar concerns have been expressed about the penguins that remain in the abandoned enclosure. The dismal environment they are forced to live in raises questions about their physical and mental well-being. Authorities Assess the Situation Officials from the Chiba Prefecture's hygiene control division visited the aquarium to assess the animals' condition. Despite the appalling conditions, they found the animals to be healthy, with Honey recovering well from a sunburn (CNN). A representative from the Prefecture stated that the private owner, Inubosaki Marine Park, is working to find a new home for the animals. Future of Honey and Other Animals Animal Rights Centre Japan is pushing for Honey to be relocated to a sanctuary, given that releasing her back into her original home could lead to her recapture by hunters. Her home is off Taiji, a Pacific coast town infamous for its annual dolphin slaughter. Some local media outlets have reported that negotiations for the transfer of the abandoned aquarium's inhabitants have ended abruptly, but concerned activists are not relenting.  One activist argued, \\"They have a responsibility to explain what they intend to do with Honey and the other animals.\\" In an effort to draw attention to the plight of these animals, people have taken to social media using the hashtag #SaveHoney. Conclusion The continued limbo in which Honey the dolphin and her fellow aquarium inhabitants find themselves has generated mounting outrage and concern among animal rights activists, citizens, and organizations. While the physical health of these animals may currently be stable, the heart-wrenching living conditions and uncertain future they face have created ripples of sympathy and concern around the world. As local authorities and activists work towards a resolution, the world watches on, hoping to see a happy ending for these abandoned creatures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The movie, directed by Vincente Minnelli, was based on Irving Stone's 1934 biographical novel of the same name, which chronicled the life and career of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. Kirk Douglas starred as van Gogh, and the film explored their tumultuous friendship and their impact on each other's work. Anthony Quinn's portrayal of Paul Gauguin in the film was highly praised. Quinn captured the essence of Gauguin's character, showcasing his bohemian spirit, creativity, and often difficult personality that led to a strained relationship with van Gogh. These aspects of Gauguin's personality were visible in his famous works created during his time spent in Tahiti and the impact he left on the world of modern art. 'Lust for Life' received widespread acclaim for its honest and emotionally complex telling of the artists' lives, particularly that of van Gogh and his struggles with mental illness. Both Douglas and Quinn delivered remarkable performances in the film. Quinn won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Paul Gauguin, while Douglas was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Vincent van Gogh.

How do you do this: To thin acrylic paints, you can","output":"To thin acrylic paints, you can follow several methods and use various materials that are compatible with these versatile, water-based art supplies. Thinning acrylic paints allows for better flow, layering, and can also help to create the desired consistency for a specific technique. Here is a step-by-step guide on some of the most common methods you can use to thin acrylic paints effectively. Method 1: Using water 1. Gather your materials: You will need acrylic paint, a container with clean water, a mixing palette or dish, a brush or palette knife, and a dropper or pipette (optional). 2. Add a small amount of paint to your mixing palette or dish: Start with a small dollop of paint, remembering that you can always add more if needed. 3. Add water to the paint: Begin by adding a small amount of water to your paint. If you are using a dropper or pipette, start with just a few drops. 4. Mix the water and paint: Using your brush or palette knife, mix the water and paint together. Be thorough and consistent in your mixing to ensure a uniform consistency. 5. Assess the consistency: Examine the paint's consistency after mixing, adding more water if needed. Aim for a consistency similar to that of heavy cream. Thicker paint might require more water, while thinner paint will need less. 6. Test your paint: Test the thinned paint on a scrap piece of paper or canvas to ensure that it flows well and covers the surface evenly. Add additional water or paint to adjust the consistency as needed. 7. Paint your canvas: Once you are satisfied with the consistency, you can start applying the thinned paint to your canvas or project. Method 2: Using acrylic mediums 1. Choose an acrylic medium: Acrylic mediums are specially formulated products designed to work with acrylic paints, affecting their consistency, transparency, and drying time. Popular mediums for thinning paints include glazing medium, gloss medium, matte medium, and flow improver. 2. Combine paint and medium: Squeeze a small amount of paint onto your mixing palette or dish, then add an equal amount of your chosen medium. 3. Mix thoroughly: Using your brush or palette knife, mix the medium and paint together until they are well combined and the consistency is smooth. 4. Adjust consistency as needed: Add more medium to your paint mixture if you would like to thin it down further or increase transparency. For a thicker consistency, add more paint. 5. Test your paint: As with the water-thinning method, test the paint on a scrap piece of paper or canvas to ensure it has the desired consistency and appearance. 6. Paint your canvas: Once you are happy with the result, use the thinned paint for your project. Method 3: Using additives 1. Choose the appropriate additive: Certain additives can also be used to thin acrylic paints. Airbrush medium, for example, is designed specifically for spray application but can work for thinning regular acrylic paints as well. 2. Mix the paint and additive: In your mixing palette or dish, combine a small amount of paint with the additive, following the manufacturer's recommendations for proportions. 3. Blend well: Mix the paint and additive together thoroughly, ensuring an even consistency throughout. 4. Assess and adjust: Check the paint consistency on your palette or in your airbrush, adding more paint or additive as necessary to achieve the desired result. 5. Test the paint: Always test the paint on a scrap piece of material to ensure it has the desired consistency and appearance. 6. Apply the paint: Once satisfied, use the thinned paint for your project, either with a brush, palette knife, or airbrush. For the best results when thinning acrylic paints, always start with small amounts of water, medium, or additive, and mix well before adding more. Testing is crucial to achieving the ideal consistency, and be sure to remember that different acrylic paint brands and colors may respond differently to thinning, so tailor your approach accordingly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: \\"Pushing Daisies\\" for sure is one of the best TV shows of its genre in the last 5 years, agree you with that or not. Bryan Fuller, the creator, has an amazing creative mind. He's the mind behind other great TV Shows as \\"Dead Like Me\\" (2003), \\"Wonderfalls\\" (2004), and the other one not as great as these ones, but also interesting, \\"Heroes\\" (2006). It's a mix of the marvelous worlds Brian Fuller created in previous TV shows, mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings, something that a fairytale always is. So, being a kind of fairytale, you cannot expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations, or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told. A gift always comes with a curse, and what is sweet can also be bitter. That's so, Ned (Lee Pace), The Piemaker, is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef: he can give life to the dead with just a touch. This could be a power that everybody would die - or live - for if wasn't for another simple and very sad thing: he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again. The curse of this amazing gift doesn't stops there... everything has a compensation and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute, another specie of that one would die instantly. He's a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up introspectively, always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love. Till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love, Chuck (Anna Friel), if wasn't for another sad fact: she was dead. He gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does, but this love is untouchable. The truly kiss of death. And that's how this beautiful modern fairytale starts. When I heard about \\"Pushing Daisies\\" for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar (or maybe some kind of tribute) to everything that Tim Burton has created since \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\\" (1985) to \\"Big Fish\\" (2003) and \\"Charlie And The Cholate Factory\\" (2005). The results could not be better. The world around The Pie Hole was magnificent. The stories around Ned and Detective Cod (Chi McBride) to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in TV, but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as Chuck and Olive (Kristin Chenoweth) in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors. Not only that, you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters, even those ones with the most deep dark humors. Forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes, the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things. The actors here are top of note. Lee Pace is tender, soft and contained as the character asks for. Anna Friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be. But the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as Chi McBride (Detective Emmerson Cod), Swoozie Kurtz (as Lilly Charles), Ellen Greene (as Vivian Charles) and Kristin Chenoweth (as Olive Snook). Swoozie Kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown, for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing. But if the best dialogs are given by Swoozie and her character, the best funny moments are given by Kristin Chenoweth. Seems that she's improvising all the time, she's so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside. Kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the 2009 Emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved. Also there's the chemistry between actors and their characters, that are also amazing. There are no words to express what this TV Show really is and what it was meant to be. For those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it, for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had: childhood. Truth be told... TV has never been so daring in a TV Show as with this amazing one. \\"Pushing Daisies\\" was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful. It's true that TV doesn't respect great TV shows as those ones Bryan Fuller created - except \\"Heroes\\" that's still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones.","output":"The sentiment of this review is very positive.

In 1887, eighteen years after the rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton was president of the new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.  Starting early in January, 1891, Carrie Chapman Catt visited Stone repeatedly at Pope's Hill, for the purpose of learning from Stone about the ways of political organizing. Stone had previously met Catt at an Iowa state woman's suffrage convention in October, 1889, and had been impressed at her ambition and sense of presence, saying \\"Mrs. Chapman will be heard from yet in this movement.\\" Stone mentored Catt the rest of that winter, giving her a wealth of information about lobbying techniques and fund-raising. Catt later used the teaching to good effect in leading the final drive to gain women the vote in 1920.  Catt, Stone and Blackwell went together to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the \\"triumvirate\\" of women's suffrage, were called away from the convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen \\"I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in what we try to do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes...\\" Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as \\"Solitude of Self\\". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.

The original equation is: -24*r + 94*r = -78*r + 2072 Start with combining like terms on both sides of the equation. 1. Combine the terms on the right side:     On the left side, you have -24*r and 94*r. When you add them together, you end up with 70*r (-24*r + 94*r = 70*r). 2. Combine the terms on the right side:     On the right side, you only have one term involving r, which is -78*r. So the right side stays as it is ie. -78*r + 2072 So, the equation reduces to: 70*r = -78*r + 2072 Next, we attempt to isolate variable 'r'. 3. Add 78*r to both sides:    In order to remove -78*r from the right side, we can add 78*r to both sides.     On the left side, 70*r + 78*r gives you 148*r,     and on the right side, -78*r + 78*r cancel out each other, leaving only 2072.  So, we end up with a simplified equation: 148*r = 2072 To solve for 'r', divide both sides by 148. 4. Solve for 'r':    To isolate 'r', divide both sides of the equation by 148 -     r = 2072 / 148 The value of 'r' (rounded to two decimal places) is approximately 14.

We develop supporting theoretical analysis from the perspectives of differentiable games and stochastic approximation. Our experiments demonstrate that latent optimisation can significantly improve GAN training, obtaining state-of-the-art performance for the ImageNet (128 x 128) dataset.

Movie title: Mommie Dearest Context: Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) is a driven actress and compulsively clean housekeeper who tries to control the lives of those around her as tightly as she controls herself. To prepare for a work day at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 a.m. and engages in a strict morning ritual: scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling hot water, then plunging her face into a bowl of rubbing alcohol and ice to close the pores. When Helga (Alice Nunn), a new maid, thinks she has Joan's living room in spotless condition, Joan finds one minor detail that she overlooked and loses her temper. Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt (Steve Forrest), but her career is in a bit of a downswing. Despite desperately wanting a baby, she is unable to get pregnant: seven pregnancies when she was married to actor Franchot Tone have all ended in miscarriages. When she is denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina (Mara Hobel), and later a boy, Christopher (Jeremy Scott Reinholt). Joan sometimes lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity. As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan - thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her, and always looking at herself in the mirror - hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her.

It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of \\"Il trovatore\\". There followed, slowly and with interruptions, the preparation of the libretto, first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare, which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions, which were accomplished under his direction. These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora.  - Digipak is a patented style of optical disc packaging, and is a registered trademark of AGI-Shorewood, an Atlas Holdings LLC company.

The block is as massive as it is practical, because the higher the inertia of the anvil, the more efficiently it causes the energy of the striking tool to be transferred to the work piece. On a quality anvil the smith's hammer should rebound with almost as much energy as the smith puts into the downward stroke, ultimately making the smith's job easier and less physically strenuous. In most cases the anvil is used as a forging tool. Before the advent of modern welding technology, it was a primary tool of metal workers.  - The San Francisco Bay Area (referred to locally as the Bay Area) is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco and San Pablo estuaries in Northern California.

In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

Background Scenario: It is holiday season, and a group of friends or family members are gathering to spend time together and share a special meal. In this context, the main character, named Alex, has a close relationship with a person named Sarah. Sarah has recently shown interest in contributing to the holiday meal by preparing the turkey dinner, which she hasn't done before. The conversation that led to this statement was centered around the notion of Sarah's participation and support during the holiday gathering. Previous Conversation (Hypothetical): Alex: Hey, I was talking to Sarah earlier, and she mentioned that she'd like to help out for the holiday dinner. She said she was really looking forward to it and wants to make sure everything goes smoothly. Friend/Family Member 1: That's so nice of her! What do you think she could help with? I know we've got pretty much everything covered. Friend/Family Member 2: Maybe she could make the dessert or salad? That could help ease some of the workload that we already have. Alex: Actually, Sarah mentioned that she'd be willing to tackle preparing the turkey dinner. What do you think about that idea? I'm not sure if she has ever done it before, but she sounded excited to give it a try. Friend/Family Member 1: Well, I think that's a big responsibility. Cooking the turkey can be quite a challenge, especially for a first-timer. Are you sure she's up for it? Friend/Family Member 2: Yeah, but it could also be a good learning experience for her. Plus, we'll all be here to support her if she needs any help. Alex: That's true. And if we guide her through the process, it could turn out to be a memorable and rewarding experience for everyone involved. What does everyone else think? Friend/Family Member 3: I'm on board with it. Sometimes it's good to let others take charge and learn new skills. We just need to be there to encourage her and help if she needs it. Then comes the statement in question: Alex (responding to Friend/Family Member 3): Of course. I think she'd appreciate it. Imagine how you both feel if she fixed the turkey dinner or something.  In summary, the conversation leading up to the statement was focused on the idea of allowing Sarah to participate in the holiday gathering by preparing the turkey dinner.

One episode had been about an emotionally troubled 12-year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man (Clu Gulager in his best performance) who is dying of cancer. Both episodes were stunning, visually unlike anything else on TV, and emotionally complex and adult. The creators of \\"The Psychiatrist\\" were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created \\"Columbo\\" and also produced its first season. Peter Falk insisted on first rank, experienced TV directors for the first season of \\"Columbo\\", like Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk agreed to Spielberg after watching part of the Clu Gulagher episode of \\"The Psychiatrist\\". Spielberg says on the DVD of \\"Duel\\" that he loved Steven Bochco's \\"Murder by the Book\\" script (based on a Levinson/Link story), and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature, even thought he had a lot less money to work with.

Spielberg also gets fine supporting work from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All the performances have a freshness and vitality about them. The only \\"Columbo\\" episode that was close to being as well directed is the \\"By Dawn's Early Light\\" episode with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). I think the two episodes of \\"The Psychiatrist\\" and this episode of \\"Columbo\\" suggest Spielberg hasn't developed technically all that much as a director. He was great from the beginning. In a \\"Combat!\\" DVD commentary of a 1962 episode guest starring Albert Salmi, Robert Altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director. Maybe the same is true of Spielberg. Would you say this review is positive or negative? Choices:  (a). negative.  (b). positive.","output":"(b). positive. The review is indeed positive. The reviewer strongly praises Steven Spielberg's work on both \\"The Psychiatrist\\" and \\"Columbo\\". They note the stylistic visual elements, emotional complexity, and standout performances that Spielberg was able to draw out and capture in his episodes, crediting him with a high level of technical skill in his directorial role. The review also highlights the fact that these achievements were made despite less-than-ideal budget circumstances. Furthermore, it recognizes the continuity of Spielberg's quality work, suggesting that his great directorial talent was evident from early in his career. Thus, the reviewer clearly expresses positive sentiments regarding Spielberg's directorial abilities and his work on the mentioned episodes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: In April 2012, a Kansas SWAT team raided the home of Robert and Addie Harte, their 7-year-old daughter and their 13-year-old son. The couple, both former CIA analysts, awoke to pounding at the door. When Robert Harte answered, SWAT agents flooded the home. He was told to lie on the floor. When Addie Harte came out to see what was going on, she saw her husband on his stomach as SWAT cop stood over him with a gun. The family was then held at gunpoint for more than two hours while the police searched their home. Though they claimed to be looking for evidence of a major marijuana growing operation, they later stated that they knew within about 20 minutes that they wouldn’t find any such operation. So they switched to search for evidence of “personal use.” They found no evidence of any criminal activity. The investigation leading to the raid began at least seven months earlier, when Robert Harte and his son went to a gardening store to purchase supplies to grow hydroponic tomatoes for a school project. A state trooper had been positioned in the store parking lot to collect the license plate numbers of customers, compile them into a spreadsheet, then send the spreadsheets to local sheriff’s departments for further investigation. Yes, merely shopping at a gardening store could make you the target of a criminal drug investigation. More than half a year later, the Johnson County Sheriff’s Department began investigating the Hartes as part of “Operation Constant Gardener,” basically a PR stunt in which the agency conducts multiple pot raids on April 20, or “4/20.” On several occasions, the Sheriff’s Department sent deputies out to sort through the family’s garbage. (The police don’t need a warrant to sift through your trash.) The deputies repeatedly found “saturated plant material” that they thought could possibly be marijuana. On two occasions, a drug testing field kit inexplicably indicated the presence of THC, the active drug in marijuana. It was on the basis of those tests and Harte’s patronage of a gardening store that the police obtained the warrant for the SWAT raid. [Meet Jay Via: One bad cop, in one county, who did a whole lot of damage] But, of course, they found nothing. Lab tests would later reveal that the “saturated plant material” was actually loose-leaf tea, which Addie Harte drinks on a regular basis. Why did the field tests come up positive for pot? As I wrote back in February, it’s almost as if these tests come up positive whenever the police need them to. A partial list of substances that the tests have mistaken for illegal drugs would include sage, chocolate chip cookies, motor oil, spearmint, soap, tortilla dough, deodorant, billiard’s chalk, patchouli, flour, eucalyptus, breath mints, Jolly Ranchers and vitamins. Back in 2009, the Marijuana Policy Project demonstrated how easily the tests could be manipulated to generate positive results : As a lab-coated and rubber glove wearing researcher from the South Carolina Center for Biotechnology dumped a sample of oregano into a field test kit, Mintwood Media’s Adam Eidinger produced a positive test result for cocaine with another kit simply by exposing it to the atmosphere. “This is just air,” Eidinger said, opening up a test and waving it as the reagent turned orange, indicating a positive result. This 2009 video, sponsored by the Marijuana Policy Project, demonstrates how tests for illegal drugs could potentially be manipulated to generate false results. (Marijuana Policy Project and Mintwood Media Collective) The testing done at the press conference replicated that done earlier by the researchers, who found that a surprisingly large number of common substances generated false positive results for the presence of drugs. “While testing the specificity of the KN Reagent test kits with 42 non-marijuana substances, I observed that 70% of these tests rendered a false positive,” said Dr. Omar Bagasra, director of the Center for Biotechnology, who conducted the experiments. That research came as part of new report, False Positives Equal False Justice, by forensics expert John Kelly in collaboration with former FBI chief scientist and narcotics officer Dr. Frederick Whitehurst. In the report, the pair uncovered “a drug testing regime of fraudulent forensics used by police, prosecutors, and judges which abrogates every American’s constitutional rights,” as Kelly wrote in the executive summary. “Law enforcement officials, forensic drug analysts, and prosecutors knowingly employ the flawed Duquenois-Levine and KN Reagent tests as well as mere conclusory police reports to wrongfully prosecute and convict millions of individuals for anti-marijuana law violations,” Kelly wrote. This is the same brand of test kit used in the Harte case. Despite the fact that the sheriff’s department didn’t begin investigating the Hartes until at least seven months after their allegedly suspicious activity (again — shopping at a gardening store) first attracted the notice of police, the sheriff’s department couldn’t wait for the more accurate laboratory tests to confirm that the “saturated plant material” was marijuana before sending a SWAT team into the Harte home. Doing so would have jeopardized the news hook of tying the raids to 4/20. It took all of 10 days to complete those lab tests. The lab not only concluded that substance wasn’t pot, the analysts added, “It does not look anything like marijuana leaves or stems.” At the conclusion of the raids, the Sheriff’s Department held a press conference to tout their success. News reports emphasized that the raids had turned up drug activity “in good neighborhoods” in places like Leawood (where the Hartes live), and at the homes of “average Johnson County families.” [In the end, 2015 saw no “war on cops\\" and no “national crime wave\\"] Once they had been cleared of any wrongdoing, the Hartes wanted to know what happened. Why had they been raided? What possible probable cause could the police have had for sending a SWAT team into their home first thing in the morning? But even that information would prove difficult to obtain. Under Kansas law, the sheriff’s department wasn’t obligated to turn over any information related to the raid — not to the Hartes, not to the media, not to anyone. The couple eventually had to hire an attorney to get a judge to order the sheriff to release the information. They spent more than 25,000 in legal fees just to learn why the sheriff had sent a SWAT team into their home. Once they finally had that information, the Hartes filed a lawsuit. Last week, U.S. District Court Judge John W. Lungstrum dismissed every one of the Hartes’s claims. Lungstrum found that sending a SWAT team into a home first thing in the morning based on no more than a positive field test and spotting a suspect at a gardening store was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. He found that the police had probable cause for the search, and that the way the search was conducted did not constitute excessive force. He found that the Hartes had not been defamed by the raid or by the publicity surrounding it. He also ruled that the police were under no obligation to know that drug testing field kits are inaccurate, nor were they obligated to wait for the more accurate lab tests before conducting the SWAT raid. The only way they’d have a claim would be if they could show that the police lied about the results, deliberately manipulated the tests or showed a reckless disregard for the truth — and he ruled that the Hartes had failed to do so. Keep in mind that this was a ruling for summary judgment. This was not a trial. To dismiss the suit at this stage, Lungstrum needed to view the facts in a light most favorable to the Hartes. And yet he still found that at no point did the police violate the family’s constitutional rights. The Hartes’s fight wasn’t completely in vain. The couple also made a political push to change Kansas law when it comes to police records and transparency. In May, the legislature passed a modest reform bill. Here’s what I wrote about the bill at the time: But while the bill is a step in the right direction, it’s far from a resounding victory for transparency, and it leaves Kansas well behind the rest of the country on this issue. Whereas the current law seals all search warrant affidavits by default, the bill would codify the presumption that the records will be made available to the owner of the premises that was searched. But there are a couple catches. Prosecutors can file a motion within five days of the search to keep the records sealed. There’s a justifiable reason for that — some searches may be part of an ongoing investigation, the details of which could be revealed in the affidavit for the warrant. The problem, of course, is that a prosecutor could just as easily file for a seal to protect himself, his office or the police officers involved from embarrassment. The onus would then be on the wrongly searched to hire an attorney to fight the seal. The far more problematic part of the law is that, while it removes the presumption that all documents related to a fruitless search should be sealed, it unseals them only for the owners of the premises that was searched. These records will still be kept sealed from the public. (It seems clear from the law that the owners could then make the documents public themselves.) That provision makes it extremely difficult for, say, a media outlet to do a broad survey of how searches are conducted by a particular police agency. (Like this, for example.) To do such a survey or investigation, a journalist would need to get permission from all of the people whose homes or businesses were searched, turning up no evidence of criminality. Without access to the documents, though, there is no way to know who those people are — or if they even exist. It makes it impossible to know if there is a problem, and impossible to identify the extent of the problem if one exists. It would be up to the people wrongly searched to come forward on their own. I was in Kansas a few months ago and spoke to a number of people who were subjected to extraordinarily violent home raids and searches. They were terrified of going public. They talked to me only because I have written on these issues in the past and felt comfortable that I wouldn’t reveal their names. An earlier, more robust reform bill initially passed the Kansas house 113-10 but was then gutted by the state’s Senate after heavy lobbying from prosecutors. During the debate over an earlier version of the bill, opponents made it clear that media scrutiny is precisely what they feared. The bill drew a sharp reaction from law enforcement circles. Prosecutors contended the bill would provide gritty details about criminal cases that the media would sensationalize. Riley County Attorney Barry Wilkerson said the bill does more more to help the media than to help individuals. “It’s not going to be the public that’s going to rush to the courthouse to get an affidavit. It’s going to be the media” . . . And, of course, we can’t have the media looking into critical public safety initiatives like “Operation Constant Gardener.” If such scrutiny revealed that cops consider merely shopping at a garden supply store to be suspicious behavior, that drug testing field kits are more about circumventing the Fourth Amendment than accurate results or that a sheriff’s boast of having shut down a drug operation run by an “average family” in a “good neighborhood” was actually a terrifying raid in which SWAT cops held two kids at gunpoint because their mother enjoyed drinking tea … well, some people might begin to question the wisdom of the drug war. [The age of “pre-crime\\" has arrived] The Hartes are also a white, financially sound couple who both happened to have worked for the CIA. Most people on the receiving end of these raids aren’t white, aren’t middle-class, didn’t once work for a federal intelligence agency and don’t have 25,000 to fund a fight in court. If even those advantages can’t help the Hartes win some accountability, you can imagine the long odds faced by the typical victim of a botched raid. The Hartes’s attorney recently told KMBC that they will likely appeal Lungstrum’s decision.

How to buy a strawberry plant  Purchase june-bearing varieties for the largest strawberries.  June-bearing strawberry plants are the most common varieties because they bear large, healthy fruit over a period of two to three weeks. Typically, june-bearing strawberries produce one crop per season.","output":"Step 1: Research suitable june-bearing strawberry varieties Before purchasing a strawberry plant, it's important to research the different june-bearing varieties available. Consider factors such as taste, size, and disease resistance. Gather information from gardening websites, books, and local nurseries. Step 2: Determine the ideal planting location Choose a location in your garden or yard where the strawberry plant will receive at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Ensure that the soil is well-draining and has a pH of 5.8 to 6.5 for optimal growth. Step 3: Visit a local nursery or garden center Visit a nearby nursery or garden center that sells june-bearing strawberry plants. Expert staff can help you select the best variety for your region and provide advice on how to grow and care for the plant. Step 4: Purchase the strawberry plant Once you have determined the ideal june-bearing strawberry variety and planting location, purchase the plant along with any necessary supplies such as soil, fertilizer, and mulch. Step 5: Prepare the planting area Prepare the location you've chosen for your strawberry plant by loosening the soil and adding compost or organic matter to improve drainage and fertility. Step 6: Plant the strawberry plant Dig a hole deep enough to accommodate the roots of the strawberry plant without bending or crowding them. Set the plant into the hole and gently spread out the roots before covering them with soil and lightly firming it around the plant base. Step 7: Water and care for the plant Thoroughly water the newly planted strawberry plant, making sure the soil is moist but not soggy. Throughout the growing season, maintain consistent moisture levels and provide fertilizer according to the recommendations for the specific strawberry variety. Step 8: Monitor growth and production Monitor the strawberry plant's progress throughout the growing season. June-bearing varieties typically produce fruit 4-6 weeks after planting, so watch for blooms and fruit development. Step 9: Harvest the strawberries When the strawberries have ripened (usually when they turn a deep red color), harvest them by gently twisting or pinching them off the plant. Step 10: Enjoy your strawberries After harvesting, enjoy your homegrown strawberries in your favorite recipes or eat them fresh for a delicious and healthy treat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is asking about the possibility of new theories or improvements, not the validity of the current. Question 2: This question is inquiring about the future prospects or path of General Relativity now that gravitational waves have been detected by LIGO. In essence, it is wanting to know what new developments or directions might come about from this discovery. So, breaking them down: Question 1 is about the possibility to find a new or improved theory that might replace or supersede General Relativity. This would answer \\"YES\\" or \\"NO\\" based on the current state of scientific knowledge and research. Question 2 is about the future prospects of General Relativity considering the fact that gravitational waves have already been detected. These prospects could range from further strengthening of the theory, to the potential for new discoveries that could lead to modifications or expansions of the theory. So, while they both concern General Relativity and gravity waves, the nature of the questions are inherently different. The first is about the potential for new theories or improvements, and the second is about the future development and impact of the current theory.

After he returned home, he proudly gave it to his mother, saying \\"My teacher let me give this letter to you.\\" Not knowing what it was, Edison's mother opened it, and then her eyes opened wide. With tears in her eyes, she looked at her son and read out the letter aloud, \\"Your child is a genius. This school is too small for him and doesn't have enough good teachers to train him. Please teach him yourself.\\" The fact was that Edison liked asking strange questions in class. His teachers thought he was mentally ill. They could no longer stand him and decided to stop him from going to school. However, Edison's mother didn't give up on her son. She taught him at home. Many years after Edison's mother died and he was already one of the greatest inventors, one day he was looking through the old family things. Suddenly he saw a piece of folded paper in the corner of a drawer. He took it and opened it up. It read, \\"Your son is addled (mentally ill).

He had, of course, brought his papers with him; so that he had no difficulty, whatever, in getting on by the train. But the train itself made but slow work of it. Bourbaki had passed west only the week before, with all his army, upon his march to the relief of Belfort; and the railway was completely choked.

Article: We've all heard about the power of positive thinking, but a recent study found that people who think they're getting fit actually get more positive benefits from activity, according to a Reuters Health article. The study examined hotel housekeepers over a period of four weeks. Some of the housekeepers were told that their work duties gave them enough activity to meet the Surgeon General's health guidelines  . Another group of housekeepers were told nothing. After four weeks, the housekeepers who believed their work activity counted as exercise lost weight and body fat, and their blood pressure went down. The results of this study suggest that it's important to understand and believe in the positive benefits of your activity. So here are a few things to think about the next time you exercise: Just thirty minutes of quick walking each day can greatly reduce your risk of a heart attack. Even your housework -- like yard work and house cleaning -- can help you burn calories and increase your fitness levels. Weight bearing activity just a few times a week can build bone density   and reduce your chances of developing osteoporosis  . Three 10-minute workouts  throughout the day are just as good to your health as one long workout. Moderate   amounts of exercise have been linked to lower rates of heart disease, stroke and even cancer. Strength training can help make daily activities like carrying bags or laundry feel easier.

Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease.

What's the best answer to this question: do i need a tourist visa for taiwan? pick from the following.  1). no  2). yes...A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Do I need a tourist visa for Taiwan?\\" depends on your nationality, the duration of your stay, and the purpose of your visit. Here's a detailed explanation: 1) Nationals of visa-exempt countries: If you are a citizen of one of the visa-exempt countries, which include the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea, among others, you generally do not need a tourist visa for short stays (up to 90 days for most countries). However, you must have a valid passport for at least 6 months (3 months for Japanese citizens and the duration of stay for U.S. citizens). Please note that for certain countries, the visa exemption duration may differ. For instance, citizens of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands are granted visa-free access for up to 180 days. 2) Nationals eligible for visa on arrival: Citizens of certain countries, such as Turkey and India, can apply for a visa on arrival at select airports and seaports in Taiwan. The eligibility for a visa on arrival depends on whether the visitor holds a valid residence, work, or student visa for the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Schengen Agreement countries, or Japan. In this case, the visitor must have a confirmed onward ticket and pay a fee in cash (NTD 2,400 for adults and NTD 1,200 for minors). The visa on arrival is generally valid for 30 days and cannot be renewed or extended. 3) Nationals requiring a tourist visa in advance: If you are not from a visa-exempt country or not eligible for visa on arrival, you must apply for a tourist visa at a Taiwanese consulate or embassy before traveling to Taiwan. In this case, the necessary documents, processing times, and fees may vary depending on your country. To determine the most appropriate answer for your specific situation, you should refer to the Taiwan visa policy and check the visa requirements based on your nationality.

The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo . Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself .

Millions of dollars have been used to help stop the spill and to clean up the animals, beaches, and land spoiled by the oil. Unfortunately, when many of these chemicals are used, more damage is caused to the environment, especially to lives in the sea. But governments seem to accept the _ of transporting mil-lions of tons of oil by ship every day so that we can fill up our cars and drive around and cause even more environmental damage. Interestingly, the biggest companies in the world produce cars, and the next biggest supply the gasoline to make them run. Of all of today's environmental disasters, an oil spill may actually be one of the least serious. Although oil is poisonous, it is a natural material. In the end, it breaks down naturally. In 1967 the tanker Torrey Canyon sank off the Scilly Isles near the coast of England and spilled 120,000 tons of oil into the ocean. If you go there today, you will find it hard to see any sign that it ever happened. However, we should be thinking more about reducing our dependency on oil. Governments should be encouraging research into new technologies, such as cars run by solar power, electricity, hydro-gen, and so on. Much of this research, in the past, was stopped by the oil, gas, and coal. If the world's millions of cars were 10% more efficient  ,we would need many fewer tankers crossing the oceans each year. If this happened, the risks of oil spills would be reduced, and the air we breathe would be cleaner and fresher, too. Question: What is the passage mainly talking about? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Oil spills pollution.\\"?

A 'lost' painting sold last year for £3,500 as the work of a John Constable copycat has been snapped up for a whopping £3.5million after it was revealed to be painted by the celebrated artist himself. Renowned auctioneers Christie's of London thought a fan had painted the study of Salisbury Cathedral in homage to Constable's famous 1831 work, and so valued it at just £500. A collector snapped it up for £3,500 in June 2013 but after taking a closer look they suspected the original artwork had been painted over. London auctioneers Christie's thought a fan had painted the study of Salisbury Cathedral (pictured) in homage to British artist John Constable's famous 1831 work. Christie's sold it for £3,500, but the painting was found to be an original work after the buyer realised it had been painted over. Restorers were called in to remove the added brushstrokes, and to the new owner's delight the oil painting was confirmed by scholars to be an original work by the Haywain artist himself. Experts say the previously unknown painting is one of several preparatory sketches Constable did before creating the masterpiece 'Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows', which was bought by the Tate gallery last year for £23.1million. After being catalogued by one of the world's leading authorities on Constable, the painting was relisted with auctioneers Sotheby's with an estimate of £2million, 4,000 times the original estimate. But after an intense bidding war the painting was sold to an unnamed bidder who forked out a staggering 5million - around £3.5million - including the auction house's fees. A spokesman for Sotheby's said: 'It is a wonderful result.' Prior to its sale in 2013 the 18in by 24in painting had been in a collection amassed in the 19th Century by William Henry Smith, founder of the high street stationary chain. It hung on the walls of Hambleden Manor in the Chilterns, home to his descendants the Viscounts Hambleden, until the Elizabethan property was sold in 2007. Lady Hambleden, 83, sold off the contents of the house - including the Constable painting - in the Christie's auction which raised £1.17m. The 'lost' artwork of Salisbury Cathedral was found to be an original sketching by British artist John Constable (depicted in this painting right). The painting was owned by Lady Hambleden (left) until she decided to sell it via Christie's of London because she 'longer had room for it' Experts said the painting is one of several preparatory sketches Constable did before creating the masterpiece 'Salisbury Cathedral From The Meadows' (above), which was bought for £23.1million last year. But specialists apparently failed to spot that the painting of Salisbury Cathedral was an original, instead listing it as being painted by 'a follower of Constable'. It was valued at £500 to £800 and sold for £3,500 to the lucky, anonymous buyer who then realised the painting had been heavily retouched in what experts say was a 'misguided attempt' to 'finish' it. Industry specialists say Lady Hambledon will have a case to sue Christie's if it can be proven the auctioneers did not carry out due diligence when checking the work. Prior to the auction Anne Lyles, a leading authority on the artist and former curator at the Tate, said Constable paintings could be tricky to attribute to the artist but she stood by her view that it was an original. She said: 'The buyer in 2013 will have taken an well-informed punt on this painting, which had a very low estimate, and then got it cleaned. 'Not everyone who takes a punt is going to get it right but on this occasion they did.' The depiction of Salisbury Cathedral (pictured) was sold by Christie's on behalf of Lady Hambleden. The famous newsagents firm was founded in 1792 when the first news vendors was opened in Little Grosvenor Street, London. It was handed down through the family until 1948 when the third Viscount Hambleden died. As Viscount Hambleden owned all the ordinary shares and the death duties were so heavy, a public holding company was formed to buy up all the share capital of WHSmith & Son Limited. The shares of the holding company were subscribed by the family, staff and public and on September 1, 1949, WHSmith & Son (Holdings) Limited was formed. Its governing director, and later its first chairman, was the Hon. David Smith - brother of the third Viscount Hambleden. However, the Smith family's control later slipped away, and the last family member left the board in 1996. Although no family member now sits on the board of the high street stationers, the Smiths collectively own £23million of company stock. Lady Hambleden, born Countess Maria Carmela Attolico di Adelfia, moved into Hambleden Manor when she married William Herbert Smith - the fourth Viscount Hambleden - in 1955. Lord Hambleden, who liked to be known as Harry, was the great-grandson of William Henry Smith, the founder of W H Smith. Lord and Lady Hambleden divorced in 1988 but she remained in the manor - in the heart of the Chilterns - while her ex-husband moved to America, where he died last August, aged 82. In 2013, she decided to sell off a number of artworks at the Elizabethan property because she now lives in a cottage in the village and 'no longer has room for them'. Ivan Macquisten, the editor of the Antiques Trade Gazette, added: 'I would be surprised if the previous vendor was not considering taking the matter further.' Before the auction a spokesman for Christie's said: 'We are aware that Sotheby's are offering this work as by Constable. 'We took the view at the time of our sale in 2013 that it was by a \\"follower of\\". We understand that there is no clear consensus of expertise on the new attribution.'

Goal: Pose for camera with great smile. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"To best accomplish the goal of posing for a camera with a great smile, it is important to consider various techniques and methods that can help enhance your appearance and convey positive emotions. Since you did not provide specific options to choose from, I will provide a comprehensive guide on how to achieve an appealing and genuine smile for the camera.  1. Mentally prepare: Before posing for the camera, make sure your thoughts are focused on positivity, happiness, or anything that makes you feel good. This will help bring out a natural, authentic smile. 2. Practice your smile: Stand in front of a mirror and practice your smile. Make a mental note of how it feels when you create a smile that feels natural and flattering. You can try various smile types, such as a full grin, a subtle smile, or a toothy smile, to see which one works best for you. This practice will allow you to easily replicate your best smile when it's time to pose for the camera. 3. Relax your face muscles: Before smiling, take a deep breath and relax your facial muscles. This will help release any tension and result in a more genuine smile. 4. Use your eyes: A great smile involves not just the mouth, but also your eyes. When you smile, your eyes should naturally wrinkle slightly at the corners. Squinting your eyes ever so lightly can help create this effect. You can also think of a happy memory to help evoke natural eye engagement. 5. Maintain good posture: A good posture can make a significant difference in the overall quality of your pose. Stand or sit up straight with your shoulders back, chin slightly raised, and head held high. This will give a sense of confidence and openness to your appearance. 6. Angle your body: Instead of facing the camera directly, try angling your body slightly. This creates a more dynamic and photogenic pose. You can also turn your head slightly, which will add some depth and dimension to the photo. 7. Experiment with different tilts and angles: Try slightly tilting your head or angling it to one side to see what looks best on you. Different head angles can convey various emotions and add character to the shot. 8. Play with hair and accessories: If you have long hair, you can toss it or run your fingers through it to create a candid and dynamic shot. Use accessories like hats, sunglasses, or props to add interest and depth to your image. 9. Show your personality: Let your true self shine through your facial expression and body language. Reflect your unique energy, confidence, and style in your pose, and your smile is more likely to appear genuine. 10. Have fun: Embrace the moment and enjoy your time in front of the camera. When you're having fun and feeling relaxed, a great smile is more likely to emerge naturally. In summary, the most reasonable approach to achieving a great smile when posing for a camera includes mental preparation, practice, engaging your eyes, maintaining good posture, angling your body, experimenting with different head tilts, playing with hair and accessories, showing your personality, and enjoying the moment. This combination of techniques will not only result in a captivating smile but also create a memorable and aesthetic photograph."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Energy is subject to a strict global conservation law; that is, whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.

Finding Galina doesn't take long, and Jacques must wrap up the mission by returning Galina and the contraband to his superiors by train. Jacques's physician wife Madeline (Susan Gibney) isn't happy about this turn of events, no doubt having invested a small fortune in a Berlitz correspondence course and a year of acting lessons for Jacques's birthday. But she sees him off at the train station with the couple's teenaged daughter Bailey Kristoff (Jessica Bowman) and son Ethan Kristoff (Kristopher Van Varenberg). It seems Galina's ill-gotten gain is three vials of SP-43, an ultra-virulent strain of smallpox, cultured in fluorescent green serum. It also seems that a group of terrorists, led by Mason Cole (Tomas Arana), intend to hijack the train and steal the virus for their own ends. But standing in their way is Jacques.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Limp Bizkit is an American rap rock band from Jacksonville, Florida, formed in 1994. Their lineup consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Sam Rivers (bass, backing vocals), John Otto (drums, percussion), and Wes Borland (guitars, backing vocals). Their music is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, also plays a large role in the band's elaborate live shows. Borland is known for performing in costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a \\"burnt match\\". Describing the character, he stated, \\"I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black--from the neck up--and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth.\\" Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5.  In addition to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan \\"Primus sucks\\": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, \\"they finger us back--and you know what that means to us--that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'\\"  During the band's sets at Ozzfest, audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit, leading the band to use a 30-foot toilet as a stage prop, which they would emerge from during each performance; the band punctuated their sets by \\"flushing\\" cardboard cutouts of pop stars like Hanson and the Spice Girls. During their appearance at the first Family Values Tour, Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the Los Angeles Times described as \\"a mix of The War Of The Worlds and Mars Attacks\\". The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour, and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances. During the band's Halloween performance on the tour, each of the band's members dressed as Elvis Presley at various stages in his career. Do they use costumes often?","output":"Yes, Limp Bizkit, especially Wes Borland, is known for using costumes and body paint during their concerts.

A 'super' strain of untreatable gonorrhea is sweeping developed countries across the world including Britain and Northern Ireland. The sexually transmitted disease, which infects millions of people every year, is becoming resistant to all antibiotics, according to the World Health Organisation. The  U.N. health agency is urging governments and doctors to step up surveillance of the STD, the second most common after chlamydia. Dangerous mutations: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes Gonorrhea, is developing new strands resistant to every treatment. Gonorrhea can cause inflammation, infertility, pregnancy complications and, in extreme cases, lead to maternal death. Babies born to mothers with gonorrhea have a 50 per cent chance of developing eye infections that can result in blindness. 'This organism has basically been. developing resistance against every medication we've thrown at it,' said. Dr Manjula Lusti-Narasimhan, a scientist in WHO's department of STDs. This includes a group of antibiotics called cephalosporins currently considered the last line of treatment. Resistance to cephalosporins was first. reported in Japan, but more recently has also been detected in Britain,. Australia, France, Sweden and Norway. As these are all countries with. well-developed health systems, it is likely that cephalosporin-resistant. strains are also circulating undetected elsewhere. More than 17,000 new cases of gonorrhea were reported in the UK in 2009. Young men and women are affected most – the highest rates of gonorrhea are seen in women aged 16-19 and men aged 20-24. 'I. think this is probably only the tip of the iceberg,' said Professor. Catherine Ison, who oversees the national surveillance program for. treatment of resistant gonorrhea in England and Wales. Clap: Disease used to be rife among sailors, soldiers and prostitutes as this American sexual hygiene poster warns. Doctors have blamed overuse or misuse of antibiotics for the disease moving towards becoming a superbug, coupled with the bacteria's astonishing ability to adapt. Professor Ison said doctors in Britain are now switching to. using a combination of antibiotics over a longer period of time to. combat resistant gonorrhea. Dr Lusti-Narasimhan said that better sex education was needed,. as proper condom use is an effective means of stopping transmission. 'We're not going to be able to get rid of it completely,' she said in an interview ahead of WHO's public announcement on its 'global action plan' to combat the disease. 'But we can limit the spread. Concern: The STD is the second most common in the UK and affects more than 17,000 people a year (posed by model) 'In a couple of years it will have become resistant to every treatment option we have available now.' Dr Lusti-Narasimhan said the new guidance is aimed at ending complacency about gonorrhea and encouraging researchers to speed up their hunt for a new cure. Once considered a scourge of sailors and soldiers, gonorrhea - known colloquially as the clap - became easily treatable with the discovery of penicillin. Now, the global health body estimates that gonorrhea is responsible for 106million infections annually. It also increases the chances of infection with other diseases, such as HIV. 'It's not a European problem or an African problem, it's really a worldwide problem,' said Dr Lusti-Narasimhan. These bacteria survive antibiotic treatment due to a mutation that makes them resistant, then quickly spread their genes in an accelerated process of natural selection. This is a general problem affecting all antibiotics, but gonorrhea is particularly quick to adapt because it is good at picking up snippets of DNA from other bacteria, said Dr Lusti-Narasimhan. 'If it didn't do so much damage it would actually be a fun organism to study,' she said. The over-the-counter availability of low potency antibiotics in some Asian countries is another reason resistance is increasing, she said. The Geneva-based WHO wants countries not just to tighten their rules for antibiotic use but also to improve their surveillance systems so that the full extent of the problem can be determined.","output":"A \\"super\\" strain of untreatable gonorrhea is spreading throughout developed countries, including the UK and Northern Ireland.

Article: The first railways in Thuringia had been built in the 1840s and the network of main lines was finished around 1880. By 1920, many branch lines had been built, giving Thuringia one of the densest rail networks in the world before World War II with about 2,500 km of track. Between 1950 and 2000 most of the branch lines were abandoned, reducing Thuringia's network by half compared to 1940. On the other hand, most of the main lines were refurbished after 1990, resulting in improved speed of travel. The most important railway lines at present are the Thuringian Railway, connecting Halle and Leipzig via Weimar, Erfurt, Gotha and Eisenach with Frankfurt and Kassel and the Saal Railway from Halle/Leipzig via Jena and Saalfeld to Nuremberg. The former has an hourly ICE/IC service from Dresden to Frankfurt while the latter is served hourly by ICE trains from Berlin to Munich. In 2017, a new high speed line will be opened, diverting long-distance services from these mid-19th century lines. Both ICE routes will then use the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway, and the Berlin-Munich route will continue via the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway. Only the segment west of Erfurt of the Frankfurt-Dresden line will continue to be used by ICE trains after 2017, with an increased line speed of 200 km/h (currently 160 km/h). Erfurt's central station, which was completely rebuilt for this purpose in the 2000s (decade), will be the new connection between both ICE lines. The most important regional railway lines in Thuringia are the Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway from Erfurt to Würzburg and Meiningen, the Weimar–Gera railway from Erfurt to Chemnitz, the Sangerhausen–Erfurt railway from Erfurt to Magdeburg, the Gotha–Leinefelde railway from Erfurt to Göttingen, the Halle–Kassel railway from Halle via Nordhausen to Kassel and the Leipzig–Hof railway from Leipzig via Altenburg to Zwickau and Hof. Most regional and local lines have hourly service, but some run only every other hour. Question: When will the new high speed train be open?","output":"The new high speed train line in Thuringia was planned to be opened in 2017, as per the information in the given passage. This new line was anticipated to divert long-distance services away from the mid-19th century lines, providing a more efficient route for the InterCity Express (ICE) services. With this infrastructure, the ICE services from Dresden to Frankfurt and from Berlin to Munich were expected to follow the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway route. Moreover, the Berlin-Munich route was also planned to continue via the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway. The novel high-speed line was part of a larger scheme to update and improve the railway network in Thuringia, which also included refurbishing the main railway lines since 1990 to enhance travel speeds, along with the complete reconstruction of Erfurt's central station in the 2000s to serve as the new connection node for both ICE lines. These developments aimed to enhance connectivity, speed, and efficiency for both regional and long-distance train services."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Controlled environment: A good-quality case provides a stable environment that safeguards the instrument from humidity and temperature changes. Excessive humidity or exposure to extreme temperatures can damage the wood, glue, or finishes of the instrument, affecting its lifespan and playability. 3. Portability: An instrument case is designed to be portable and easy to carry, with handles, straps, or even wheels for larger cases. This makes it convenient for traveling to and from lessons, rehearsals, performances, or even across long distances. 4. Organization and storage: Mandolin cases often include compartments for organizing accessories such as strings, picks, straps, and sheet music. This ensures that all your essentials are in one place and easily accessible when needed. While the other options mentioned can serve as temporary storage solutions, they do not provide the same level of protection and care that a dedicated instrument case for your mandolin offers. - Closet: Storing your mandolin in a closet might be a suitable short-term solution, but it may not provide the necessary protection against damage, especially if the closet is prone to dramatic temperature or humidity changes. Additionally, accidental falls or bumps could easily occur, leading to damage. - Musical instrument store, music shop, and music store: These options imply leaving your mandolin at a commercial establishment when not in use. This is not a practical or cost-effective solution, considering the ongoing fees and lack of accessibility to your instrument. Also, retaining responsibility for your instrument's care is essential, and relying on a third-party storage facility does not guarantee proper handling and maintenance. In summary, a mandolin-specific instrument case is the best answer to safeguard your valuable mandolin when not in use. This option provides the necessary protection, controlled environment, portability, and organization that are essential for maintaining the instrument's longevity and playability."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: what year was mario popular I found the following answer on Google: This is a list of video games where the character Mario plays a part, either as the protagonist , antagonist , supporting character , as part of an ensemble cast , as a cameo , or in a game within a game.

Given the question \\"Why did Jordan do this?\\", is \\"be polite\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"be polite\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Jordan do this?\\" However, it's important to provide a more detailed and in-depth response to fully address the various aspects of the situation and the possible underlying reasons for Jordan's actions.  Jordan's decision to hold the door open and let his friends come into his house can be attributed to multiple factors. While politeness is one of the primary reasons, there may be other factors at play as well. Here's a more comprehensive and holistic explanation: 1. Politeness and Etiquette: As mentioned in the given answer, Jordan's action of holding the door can be interpreted as an act of politeness and good manners. In many cultures, holding the door open for others is a sign of respect and consideration. By doing this, Jordan is showing that he values his friends and wants to make them feel welcome and appreciated. 2. Social Norms: Jordan might have held open the door as a way of following social norms and expectations. Society often dictates that one should be hospitable and courteous to guests, which includes actions like holding open the door. By following these norms, Jordan is showcasing his adherence to the unspoken rules that govern social behavior. 3. Proactive Hosting: Holding the door open could also be interpreted as an act of proactive hosting. As a host, Jordan wants to ensure that his friends have a pleasant experience at his house. By holding the door and letting them enter with ease, Jordan is demonstrating his attentiveness to their needs and making an effort to facilitate a smooth transition into his home. 4. Safety and Security: Another reason for holding the door open could be related to safety and security. By personally opening the door for his friends, Jordan is not only able to greet them warmly, but he can also ensure that only invited guests are entering his house. This adds an extra layer of security and assurance for both Jordan and his friends. 5. Nonverbal Communication: Lastly, Jordan's act of holding the door open might serve as a form of nonverbal communication. By doing this, Jordan is conveying a message of warmth, hospitality, and openness to his friends, even without using words. This gesture helps set the atmosphere for the gathering and fosters a sense of camaraderie among the group. In conclusion, while \\"be polite\\" is indeed a valid answer to explain Jordan's actions, it's important to consider the various factors that could have influenced his decision. By taking into account politeness, social norms, proactive hosting, safety, and nonverbal communication, we can provide a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the situation."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Every day revolved around alcohol on some form or fashion. It literally was like the movie Animal House Now these 2 friends (let's call them Bill and Ted) were a little dorky compared to the rest of the other guys. We all played sports in high school and college and they were more like bookworms. Borderline alcoholics but bookworms. They were really awkward around girls but funny as hell around guys. Long story short. Both of them got involved into serious relationships after college and ended up marrying these girls. One girl was this born again Christian who vowed to cleanse Bill from his evil ways. Bill was so far removed from his friends (the wolfpack!) that he didn't even invite us to his wedding. It's been maybe 14-15 yrs now and I have no clue what he's doing. I think one of my friends did attend the wedding but it was only because they desperately needed a groomsmen. Ted married this girl who seemed cool at first but after marriage, he stopped coming to any and all get togethers. He always had an excuse. He ended up moving a few hrs away and eventually just stopped responding to us. He did show up to a mutual friend's wedding maybe 3 yrs ago. He has a baby now but he's alot different than how he used to be. Other than Bill and Ted, all my other friends got married and have pretty normal marriages.

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\",  answer the following question.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I read this background article the other day: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.  I am facing a new situation today: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? A:","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, it can be inferred that the Madrigal Ocean is probably connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean. The lower salinity in the Madrigal Ocean indicates that there is a higher amount of fresh water inflow, which is typically caused by the presence of rivers and streams that run into the ocean. In the case of the Arctic Ocean, its lower salinity compared to other major oceans is attributed to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. By applying this understanding to the Madrigal Ocean, one can reasonably assume that its lower salinity is due to a higher number of rivers emptying into it compared to the Listy Ocean."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the dig. To be as brief as possible, Pharaoh's Curse is quite the lackluster affair. While the movie does present a few good, original ideas (blood sucking mummy's, soul transference, interesting make-up effects, the arm ripping scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. To make matters even worse, the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding. I usually go for these slow moving mummy movies, but Pharaoh's Curse tests even my patients. The cast helps very little.

They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people. He recorded younger population as population B.  But I can use this background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.  What is an answer for this question: Which population would have shorter reflex time, population A or population B? A:","output":"To answer the question of which population would have a shorter reflex time, Population A or Population B, we need to consider the information given about each population and their characteristics in terms of abilities and health issues.

There is no specific information about Population B's reflex times, but since they are a younger population, we can assume that their reflex times have not been negatively affected by aging as much as Population A.

Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das Englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \\"the most talented Gothicist of his day\\".

Civilians, caught in the crossfire, faced the devastating consequences of this conflict, with casualties mounting on both sides. As the situation grew increasingly dire, international pressure mounted for a ceasefire and diplomatic efforts to achieve a lasting resolution intensified. Despite the warnings from both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the violence escalated, taking a heavy toll on the infrastructures and lives of the people in the region. Buildings, already damaged by previous fighting, crumbled further, and essential services, such as hospitals and schools, found themselves struggling to cope. Relentless airstrikes and rocket attacks choked the skies over the region, stirring unease and fear among the local population. Amidst the mounting chaos, diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire came to the fore. World leaders and influential diplomats made urgent calls for dialogue and appealed for a return to negotiation, fearing the crisis could spiral out of control and plunge the region into even deeper turmoil. The international community grew steadily more concerned, closely monitoring the situation and offering their assistance in achieving peace. Unfortunately, mistrust and deeply entrenched animosity on both sides of the conflict made it difficult to find common ground. A series of failed ceasefires and broken promises only exacerbated the violence and dashed hopes for a speedy resolution. United Nations representatives urged for an immediate halt to hostilities and implored both sides to prioritize the protection of civilians, who bore the brunt of the devastation. As the conflict dragged on, the impacts on the Palestinian and Israeli populations only worsened. The numbers of dead and injured grew with each passing day, alongside those displaced from their homes. A humanitarian crisis loomed, with food and medical supplies dwindling, and access to clean water becoming dangerously scarce. International aid agencies worked tirelessly in an attempt to deliver essential resources and provide support to those affected. Against this bleak and seemingly unending backdrop, the involved parties chose to reevaluate their positions. Neither side appeared to be able to achieve a decisive victory, making it clear that military action alone would not bring an end to the violence. Further losses and suffering on both sides compelled them to return to the negotiating table, encouraging a shift towards more peaceful means of conflict resolution. Intermediaries helped to bring the Israeli and Palestinian leadership together, paving the way for renewed dialogue and communication. Through difficult negotiations, characterized by moments of tension, stubbornness, and ultimately a mutual willingness to achieve peace, they crafted a new ceasefire agreement that aimed to address the root causes of the conflict. The agreement, while not perfect, marked a significant step towards stability and peace in the region. Both sides made considerable concessions, and, with the help of international guarantors, took on the challenging task of rebuilding their fractured communities. The hardships endured throughout the conflict served as a chilling reminder of the toll that war takes on human lives, making it all the more imperative for both countries to foster trust and goodwill and to actively work towards achieving lasting peace in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The mechanic tried to cover the car with a tarp but it didn't fit because  the","output":"tarp was too small, leaving a significant portion of the vehicle exposed to the harsh weather conditions that were rapidly approaching, causing him to reconsider his options as he stood there, scratching his head, and feeling a growing sense of unease about the well-being of the delicate machinery within the car. He knew that in order to protect the recently polished exterior and intricately assembled engine-system from the wind-driven rains and possibly hail that the storm could potentially unleash upon the garage, he needed to act fast and come up with an efficient solution that would also not cost him a fortune. Having spent years in the automotive field, the mechanic swiftly reviewed his inventory of tools and spare materials while pondering over different ways he could cover the car completely. He also took into account the time constraint he found himself under and needed to make sure that his chosen method would not take up too much of his time as the storm clouds had already begun to darken the sky above. After much thought, he remembered an old idea that he had once come across in a magazine, where cars were covered by using multiple layers of cling film, protecting them from dust, dirt, and even water. Deciding that this makeshift solution might be his best option under the circumstances, the mechanic hurriedly located a large roll of industrial-grade cling film from the storage room and started working meticulously on wrapping the car from the roof all the way down to the undercarriage. He ensured that each layer was tightly wrapped around the contours of the car and properly sealed to avoid any moisture from seeping in. Once he was satisfied with the coverage, he doubled up on the cling film around the edges, further reinforcing them to make sure that the strong gusts of wind would not tear apart the plastic, leaving the car vulnerable. Finally, as a finishing touch, the mechanic wrapped one last layer of strong, waterproof fabric around the car, and tied it securely with ropes and carabiners to create a tight seal against the impending storm. And not a moment too soon, as the rain began to fall in earnest while the wind began picking up pace, howling and slamming into the garage with tremendous force. The mechanic took a moment to observe his handiwork, feeling a great relief in knowing that the car would be protected from the damages of the storm due to his quick thinking and resourcefulness. As the storm raged outside, the mechanic couldn't help but appreciate the power of adaptation and creativity in finding solutions to unexpected problems. He knew that no matter what challenges life would throw his way, as long as he remained open to learning and thinking outside the box, he would be able to rise above them and succeed. Indeed, it was this very attitude that had driven him to become the skilled and sought-after mechanic he was today, and as he watched the storm rage outside while the car remained safely blanketed in its protective cocoon, he couldn't help but feel a great sense of satisfaction in knowing that he had once again emerged as a master of his craft, conquering whatever obstacles were thrown his way."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. 1928 is in many ways a \\"lost year\\" in motion pictures. Just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre, sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology. \\"Show People\\" is one of the great silent era comedies. The film shows that William Haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him, learns his lesson, and then redeems himself by winning the football game, the polo game, etc. This movie is also exhibit A for illustrating that Marion Davies was no Susan Alexander Kane. She had excellent comic instincts and timing. This film starts out as the Beverly Hillbillies-like adventure of Peggy Pepper (Marion Davies) and her father, General Marmaduke Oldfish Pepper, fresh from the old South. General Pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress. While at the studio commissary, the Peppers run into Billy Boone (William Haines), a slapstick comedian. He gets Peggy an acting job. She's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick, but she perseveres. Eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and Billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles. Soon the new-found fame goes to her head, and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man, whom she doesn't really love, unless fate somehow intervenes. One of the things MGM frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at MGM circa 1930. This film is one of those, as we get Charlie Chaplin trying to get Peggy's autograph, an abundance of cameos of MGM players during that era including director King Vidor himself, and even a cameo of Marion Davies as Peggy seeing Marion Davies as Marion Davies arriving at work on the lot. Peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her. Truly a delight from start to finish, this is a silent that is definitely worth your while.

Movie plot title: Once Upon a Time in the West Movie plot: The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction. He tries to buy the farm cheaply by intimidating the other bidders, but Harmonica arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid based on his reward money for delivering Cheyenne to the authorities. Harmonica rebuffs an offer by Frank to buy the farm from him for...

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

Which language is this?","output":"The language you have used in your text is Romanian.  Romanian is a Romance language spoken primarily in Romania and Moldova. It developed from the Vulgar Latin spoken in the region of the Danube by the Romans in late antiquity. It shares significant similarities with other Romance languages like Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan. However, due to its geographical location, it also contains elements from non-Romance languages such as Hungarian, German, and Slavic languages, particularly Bulgarian and Serbian.  The text’s structure also indicates its linguistic roots. For instance, word endings often change according to gender, number, and case - a feature typical of Romance languages. The word “președintele”, for instance, is a masculine noun that changes form when the gender or number changes. Furthermore, Romanian language uses diacritical marks, like in words \\"preşedintele\\" and \\"daţi-mi\\", which modify the sound of the letter they mark. In terms of its vocabulary, the text also displays the influence of Latin to the Romanian language. For example, “condoleanţele” is a noun form of the verb “to condole,” and can be directly traced back to the Latin verb condolere, meaning “to deeply feel or express sympathy.” Similarly, “victimelor” is a plural form of the noun \\"victima\\" which means \\"victim\\". Words like these mirror those found in other Romance languages. The text itself seems to be a formal political discourse or statement, as indicated by its refined language and the presence of words such as “președinte” (president), “tema” (topic), “dezbatere” (debate) and other formal phrasings such as “dați-mi voie” (allow me).    This language is part of the Indo-European language family, the largest language family in terms of native speakers and number of languages. Despite the country’s isolation from the rest of Latin-speaking Western Europe, the Romanian language has managed to preserve its Latin roots while also incorporating other linguistic features from surrounding languages due to historical and geographical influences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Swiss voters reject 'money for nothing' universal income proposal LAUSANNE, Switzerland – Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have guaranteed everyone in the Alpine nation an unconditional basic income, according to projections published Sunday by public broadcaster SRF1. The plan could have seen people in this wealthy nation of 8 million people receive about 2,500 Swiss francs (2,560) per month — enough to cover their basic needs. Proponents argued that a basic income would free people from meaningless toil and allow them to pursue more productive or creative goals in life. Critics said the plan would explode the state budget and encourage idleness, arguments that appear to have convinced voters. Based on a partial count of results from 19 Swiss cantons (states), the gfs.bern polling group calculated that 78 percent of voters opposed the measure against 22 percent in favor. The Swiss government itself advised voters to reject the proposal put forward by left-wing campaigners who collected the necessary 100,000 signatures to force a vote on the issue. But the idea has won over some economists, who say it could replace traditional welfare payments and give everybody the same chances in life. Salaried workers who earned more than basic income would have received no extra money, while children would have received one-quarter of the total for adults. The Dutch city of Utrecht is planning a two-year experiment with a similar plan, handing money to residents who already receive welfare benefits. The unconditional basic income proposal was one of five measures up for decision nationwide Sunday. Proposals to reform publicly owned companies and financing of transport routes was rejected, while voters backed plans to simplify the application procedures for asylum-seekers and another that will allow screening of embryos before they are implanted in the womb. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The people in Switzerland had a chance to vote on an idea called \\"universal basic income.\\" This means that everyone in the country would get a certain amount of money every month, even if they don't have a job or do any work. Some people thought this was a good idea because it would help people with their basic needs, and let them do more creative or helpful things in life.  However, most people in Switzerland did not agree with this idea. They thought it would cost the government too much money and make people lazy. So, when they voted, 78% of people said \\"No\\" to the proposal. Even the Swiss government advised people to vote against it.  But there are still some places in the world that want to try this idea, like a city in the Netherlands called Utrecht. They will experiment with giving money to some residents for two years.

No. Now, to answer your first question: How realistic is the best text-to-speech software? The realism of the best text-to-speech (TTS) software has improved significantly over the years. Early TTS systems sounded robotic and lacked natural intonation, making them difficult to listen to for extended periods. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning have greatly enhanced the realism and quality of TTS software. Today's best TTS software utilizes sophisticated algorithms to generate speech that is nearly indistinguishable from human voices. These algorithms analyze natural language patterns and utilize deep learning techniques to produce more realistic speech output, capturing the intricacies of human speech such as pitch, rate, and intonation. As a result, the best TTS software can output speech that sounds smooth, fluid, and expressive, closely resembling the unique qualities of a human voice. Furthermore, modern TTS systems can understand and correctly pronounce complex words, abbreviations, and even foreign languages with a high degree of accuracy.  In spite of these advancements, some discrepancies may still be present, such as slight deviations in pronunciation or expression compared to a natural human voice. Nevertheless, the gap between human and synthetic speech continues to narrow as technology and AI progress. Now, to answer your second question: What is the best text-to-speech software? Identifying the best text-to-speech software is a subjective matter, as it depends on the user's specific needs and preferences. However, some of the top TTS software in the market, known for their quality and realism, are as follows: 1. Google Text-to-Speech: Powered by Google's robust machine learning technology, it produces natural-sounding speech. This TTS solution is widely used in various applications, including Google Assistant, Google Translate, and several third-party apps. 2. Amazon Polly: Amazon Polly is another highly realistic TTS system that utilizes deep learning techniques to produce lifelike speech. It offers a wide range of voices and languages, making it a popular choice for content creators and developers. 3. Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Speech Service: This cloud-based TTS service, part of Microsoft's Azure platform, provides an extensive selection of voices and languages, with powerful customization features to control aspects like pitch, rate, and pronunciation. 4. IBM Watson Text to Speech: Leveraging IBM's Watson technology, this TTS service offers quality speech synthesis with support for various languages and fine-tuning options. 5. Nuance Vocalizer: Nuance has long been a leader in speech recognition and synthesis. Their Vocalizer product offers high-quality TTS with extensive language support and customization options to create more natural-sounding voice outputs. Each of these TTS software options has unique features and strengths, so the decision on which is the best depends on the specific requirements and intended use.

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Practical effects of designating al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" resulted in small achievement after what date?\\" is \\"March 10\\"?","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"Practical effects of designating al Qaeda a 'foreign terrorist organization' resulted in small achievement after what date?\\" is not \\"March 10\\". Rather, it is \\"October 1999\\", as mentioned in the paragraph, \\"After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a 'foreign terrorist organization,' it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.  I am facing a new situation today: Ned learned about reactions at a higher temperature for his physics class, while Paul had to learn about reactions at lower temperatures.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person studied about a slower reaction rate?","output":"To answer the question correctly, let's think step-by-step and justify our steps based on the knowledge acquired from the background article: Step 1: Identify the main concepts from the background article.

In the new situation, Ned learned about reactions at higher temperatures, and Paul learned about reactions at lower temperatures. Step 3: Apply the knowledge from the background article to the new situation. According to the background article, reactions at lower temperatures have a slower reaction rate. Step 4: Answer the question correctly based on the analysis and knowledge applied. Since Paul studied reactions at lower temperatures, and reactions at lower temperatures are slower, the correct answer is that Paul studied about a slower reaction rate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first quarter, the Bears scored first when Jordan Howard ran for a 3-yard touchdown to take a 7-0 lead for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, the Steelers managed to tie it up at 7-7 when Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 7-yard pass. The Bears moved ahead by double digits later on when Mike Glennon found Adam Shaheen on a 2-yard pass to make it 14-7. This would be followed up by Connor Barth's 24-yard field goal to make it 17-7 at halftime. After the break, the Steelers got back to work and came within 3 as Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make it 17-14. They would tie the game up in the fourth quarter when Chris Boswell nailed a 32-yard field goal. The Steelers then tried their hand at coming back for the win later on in the quarter, but Roethlisberger was sacked in Bears territory, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Bears got the ball. They would win it by way of Howard's 19-yard run for a touchdown and the final score 23-17. With the loss and 9-game regular season winning streak snapped, the Steelers dropped to 2-1 and with the Ravens' loss to the Jaguars moved into a tie on top of the AFC North.

See options at the end On a sunny day in the park, Betty asked Emily if   - Betty hoped not to encounter a dog.. - Emily hoped not to encounter a dog..","output":"On a sunny day in the park, Betty asked Emily if Emily hoped not to encounter a dog. The reason behind this question was their conversation in which Emily had previously mentioned that she had a not-so-positive experience with a dog in the past, which had caused her to develop an uneasy feeling towards dogs. While she didn't necessarily dislike dogs, she felt apprehensive whenever she encountered one, especially if it was off-leash. Betty was inquisitive and genuinely concerned about her friend's past experience and how it had developed into a deep-seated fear. She wanted to provide support to Emily and ensure that their day at the park would be a joyful experience – free of any stress or anxiety. When Emily responded to Betty's question, she explained that while she did have a bit of anxiety around dogs, she didn't want it to ruin their time at the park. She acknowledged that her fear was something she needed to work on and that keeping her distance from any dog they may come across would be the best approach for the time being. Emily also appreciated Betty's understanding and willingness to create a comfortable environment for her. Upon hearing Emily's response, Betty suggested that they should choose a spot to sit that was relatively free from any dogs that might unexpectedly come up to them. This showed Betty's empathy and consideration for Emily's feelings and her desire to be accommodating. They found a perfect spot beneath a large tree in a quieter corner of the park. The rest of the day was filled with laughter and deep conversations, enabling Emily to momentarily forget about her fear. Betty took the opportunity to encourage Emily to seek therapy or support groups for individuals who shared her fear of dogs, hoping that it might help her overcome her apprehension in the long run. The day ended on a positive note, as the two friends were able to enjoy their time together at the park. Betty's understanding and support towards Emily's situation showcased the true meaning of friendship and how empathy plays an essential role in creating a comfortable and nurturing environment. It was clear that Emily appreciated Betty's efforts, and this cemented their bond as friends – always being there for each other through thick and thin. In conclusion, the sentence should end like this: \\"On a sunny day in the park, Betty asked Emily if Emily hoped not to encounter a dog.\\" This ending exemplifies a genuine concern from Betty and becomes the central focus of a meaningful day at the park, where friendship and empathy take center stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the questionable comedy vein of Mel Brooks, \\"Wholly Moses!\\" tries to take the Bible story of Moses and make fun of it, resulting in the unfunniest Biblical spoof ever filmed. There is no real plot here, just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles. Dudley Moore and Laraine Newman are on a bus tour of the Holy Land, when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave. There they read the story of Herschel and Zerelda, also played by Moore and Newman. Herschel's life parallels Moses'. He was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh's family at the same time Moses was. Herschel's birth father, the late James Coco, becomes Herschel's slave after Herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor. Eventually Herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer, is banished, and ends up tending Moses' flock of sheep. Herschel and Moses are brothers in law, marrying sisters, and Herschel thinks God has chosen him to free his people in Egypt. Of course, Moses was receiving the Divine Word, but Herschel misunderstood. I'll pause here to laugh hysterically...pause...anyway, the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving Moore and actors who are making \\"special appearances.\\" These scenes do not propel the plot forward, they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt. Jack Gilford plays a tailor. Dom DeLuise has maybe three lines when he meets Herschel in the desert. John Houseman is an archangel, just giving the same line readings he gave in \\"The Paper Chase.\\" David L. Lander is a fake blind man \\"healed\\" by Herschel. Andrea Martin is one of Zerelda's sisters. I was not sure who Madeline Kahn was supposed to be, she gives a ride to Herschel, and has about a minute and a half of screen time. John Ritter plays a very unfunny devil. Richard Pryor has one scene as the pharaoh, but it was obviously shot at a different time than Moore's scene because the two do not appear onscreen together! In the end, Zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on New Sodom's destruction, ha ha. Herschel writes the Ten Commandments, and gives them to Moses, who is basking in all the glory. In the final scenes, the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having Herschel bait God into an argument. God comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading Herschel around for his own amusement, speaking through him only to give him the Ten Commandments. We even have Zerelda quip \\"God works in mysterious ways,\\" thereby excusing everyone's very unChristian behavior during the film. This film is not funny. There is nary a laugh to be found anywhere. At least Monty Python made fun of many established religious mainstays in \\"Life of Brian\\" in addition to their questionable take on Jesus' life, but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads. This makes Mel Brooks look like Merchant/Ivory. Churchgoers will be offended, not by the film's attitude toward religion, but by the smugness the movie exhibits, impressed with their own hoitytoityness (I know, not a word) on a subject they obviously know nothing about. \\"Wholly Moses!\\" is wholly bad, and an embarassment to all involved. I suggest you read the Book instead. This is rated (PG) for some physical violence, profanity, sexual references, and adult situations.

In this Romanian translation, the sentence retains the original meaning and tone, expressing the idea that those who have wasted the wealth generated by a hardworking and creative population must be held responsible for their actions. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the translation: - Acești oameni (These people) - This is used as a subject, referring to the people who squandered the wealth. In Romanian, the definite article is attached to the end of the noun, and 'acești' is the plural masculine form of 'these.' - au risipit (squandered) - The Romanian verb 'a risipi' translates to 'squander' and is conjugated here in the perfect compound tense, which is used for expressing a completed action in the past. - bogăția (the wealth) - The noun 'bogăție' means wealth, and the '-a' ending shows the singular form of the noun with a definite article. - creată (created) - The past participle of the verb 'a crea' (to create) is 'creat' for the masculine form and 'creată' for the feminine form. As 'bogăția' is a feminine noun, we use 'creată' in this context. - de o populație energică și inovatoare (by an energetic and innovative population) - This phrase describes the source of the 'wealth.' 'O populație' means 'a population,' while 'energică' means 'energetic' and 'inovatoare' means 'innovative.' Both adjectives are feminine singular forms, as they refer to the feminine noun 'populație.' - și trebuie (and they must) - The conjunction 'și' means 'and,' and 'trebuie' is the impersonal verb 'to must' or 'have to.' - să fie trași la răspundere (be held accountable) - The verb 'a trage la răspundere' means 'to hold accountable,' and it is conjugated here using the subjunctive mood, which is often used for expressing obligation or necessity. 'Să fie trași' is the auxiliary construction that serves as the subjunctive verb for the masculine plural form, which refers back to 'these people.'"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Margaret Holliday had to be rescued by paramedics after her silver Hyundai Getz was left teetering on the edge of the wall and another resident's lawn in Moseley, Birmingham. The 81-year-old was trying to edge back out of her garage when her brakes failed and sent her flying backwards, at about midday on Saturday afternoon. The woman, in her eighties, had a lucky escape after she managed to get her car stuck on top of a brick wall.

Here's a question: What might a fish avoid for safety?  Here are possible answers to this question: - stream - end of line - market - pond - boat  I believe the correct choice is \\"boat\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"A fish might avoid a boat for safety, and there are several reasons behind this choice. While each of the options listed – stream, end of line, market, pond, and boat – pose their own potential risks to fish, the most immediate and direct threat to the fish's safety comes from boats. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. Boats: Boats pose the most significant and immediate danger to fish, specifically due to fishing activities carried out by humans. Boats often are equipped with fishing gear such as nets or lines, and being in close proximity to a boat increases the likelihood of a fish being caught, injured, or killed. Additionally, boats can cause disturbances to the water, which may disrupt the fish's natural habitat and lead to stress or injury. Noise pollution from boat engines can also disorient and distress fish, affecting their ability to navigate and communicate with each other. 2. Stream: While a fish might avoid a stream if it's polluted, streams are generally considered natural habitats for many species of fish. Unless the stream is polluted or obstructed, a fish is unlikely to avoid one for safety reasons. In fact, streams can provide necessary resources for fish, like food, shelter, and a means of transportation to other areas for breeding or migration. 3. End of line: It is unclear what \\"end of line\\" refers to in this context. If it is related to the end of a fishing line, then it might be a potential danger for a fish to avoid. However, since it's not directly specified here, it seems less of a threat compared to a boat, which implies the presence of fishing equipment. 4. Market: Fish markets are major threats to the safety of fish, as they represent a location where fish end up once they have been captured and killed. However, fish markets do not pose a direct danger to fish still in the water, as they are not located underwater. 5. Pond: Like streams, ponds are natural habitats for many fish species. Although there may be cases where ponds could be unsafe for fish (e.g., if they are polluted or overcrowded), these bodies of water generally provide necessary resources for their inhabitants and are essential for the sustainability of fish populations.  In conclusion, a fish would most likely avoid a boat for safety due to the direct and immediate danger posed by fishing activities, disturbances to water and noise pollution. Other options, such as a stream or pond, may have potential dangers in certain cases, but these bodies of water are generally considered natural habitats, providing shelter and resources for fish. While markets are dangerous for fish that have been captured, they do not pose a direct threat to fish in their natural environment. The \\"end of line\\" is an unclear term, but it is less directly threatening compared to a boat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both sentences describe a young boy mistreated by his parents, who offers part of his meal to someone else. However, the major difference lies in the descriptions of the individuals that the mistreated boy offers his meal to. In the first sentence, \\"A strange dark boy, mistreated by his parents, offers a young rider a play of his meal,\\" the mistreated boy is described as a strange, dark boy. He offers his meal to a young rider. Additionally, the word \\"play\\" in this context seems to be a typo or error, most likely meant to be \\"part\\" or \\"piece\\" of his meal, which would make more sense in the given context. In the second sentence, \\"A young boy, mistreated by his parents, offers a strange dark rider a piece of his meal,\\" the mistreated boy is simply described as a young boy, without any further specifications about his appearance. This time, he offers his meal to a strange, dark rider. The description \\"strange, dark rider\\" distinguishes this character from the young rider in the previous sentence.

Yes; b). No; Answer:","output":"b). No; The correct response to the question \\"heating salt water leaves the salt where?\\" is not \\"on the surface\\". When you heat salt water, the water evaporates and turns into steam. This process is called evaporation. Salt is a non-volatile solute and does not convert into a gas when heated. Therefore, it remains behind in the container where the water was heated. The salt is left at the bottom of the container, not on the surface. This is a result of a process called distillation, which separates mixtures based on differences in their volatilities in a boiling liquid mixture. So, despite the given assumption that heating salt water leaves the salt on the surface, this is scientifically incorrect.

There will be 4 columns: number 1, day 1, hour 2, hour 3, day 7, day 13, day 21..","output":"The other columns should be labeled each day of the week to easily identify the activities you have planned for each specific day. Starting from the second column, label it as Monday, followed by Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in the subsequent columns. After you have labeled each column with the days of the week, you can proceed to fill in the time slots in the first, left-most column; for example, if you wake up at 7 am and go to bed at 11 pm, the initial row in the left column should read 7 am. Then, fill in the remaining time slots in the left column in increments of your choice, such as 30 minutes or hourly intervals, depending on your personal preference and the granularity of your daily activities. Once you have your columns and times established, begin to populate your spreadsheet with your daily activities, tasks, and appointments. For each day of the week, fill in the corresponding time slots with the tasks you have planned, making sure to include any recurring responsibilities, such as work, school, or exercise, as well as unique events like meetings, social engagements, or appointments. Additionally, allocate time for self-care rituals, such as meal preparation, relaxation, and personal hygiene. To maximize productivity and prevent burnout, be sure to incorporate breaks within your schedule. Dedicating time for rest will allow you to recharge and maintain focus throughout the day. Also, remember to include buffers between activities to accommodate for any unexpected adjustments in your timetable. This flexibility will ensure that your daily routine remains organized and manageable. Furthermore, prioritizing routines that occur during the most productive times of your day can help enhance overall efficiency. For example, if you tend to be more energetic in the mornings, consider scheduling vital and demanding tasks during this time. Conversely, if you generally feel sluggish in the afternoons, reserve this timeframe for less strenuous undertakings or leisure activities, adjusting as needed based on your energy patterns. Finally, commit to regularly updating and refining your schedule to accommodate your evolving needs and preferences. Take time to evaluate the effectiveness of your routine, as well as to identify areas requiring improvement. Through consistent evaluation and adjustment, you can optimize your organization, productivity, and satisfaction with your routine, ultimately ensuring that it successfully serves your goals and lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: That Was the Week That Was, informally TWTWTW or TW3, was a satirical television comedy programme on BBC Television in 1962 and 1963. It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost. The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. A Canadian show, This Hour Has Seven Days, aired from 1964 to 1966 on CBC. Although partially inspired by That Was The Week That Was, the Canadian show mixed satirical aspects with more serious journalism. It proved controversial and was cancelled after two series amid allegations of political interference. This Hour Has 22 Minutes, created by Newfoundland comic Mary Walsh, has been running since 1992 although the two are not related.  An Australian show, The Mavis Bramston Show, aired from 1964 to 1968 on the Seven Network. It grew out of the recent local theatrical tradition of topical satirical revue--most notably the popular revues staged at Sydney's Phillip Street Theatre in the 1950s and 1960s--but it was also strongly influenced by the British satire boom and especially TW3 and Not Only... But Also.  The New Zealand show A Week Of It ran from 1977 to 1979, hosted by Ken Ellis, and featuring comedians David McPhail, Peter Rowley and Chris McVeigh and comedian/musicians Jon Gadsby and Annie Whittle. The series lampooned news and politics and featured songs, usually by McPhail and Gadsby, who continued with their own show, McPhail and Gadsby in similar vein.  A Dutch version, Zo is het toevallig ook nog 's een keer, aired from November 1963 to 1966. It became controversial after the fourth edition, which included a parody of the Lord's Prayer (\\"Give us this day our daily television\\"). Angry viewers directed their protests especially against the most popular cast member: Mies Bouwman. After receiving several threats to her life she decided to quit the show. The show was praised as well: in 1966 it received the Gouden Televizier-ring, a prestigious audience award--though it turned out afterward that the election was rigged.  An Indian version titled The Week That Wasn't was launched and hosted by Cyrus Broacha.

(CNN)A substance described as \\"white stuff\\" and \\"milky rain\\" is covering parts of Washington and Oregon states, but  its origin is a mystery. \\"We have received reports of 'white stuff' on vehicles. The ash is more than likely from the Volcano Shiveluch,\\"  Washington state's Walla Walla County Emergency officials said in statement. The volcano, located on the Kamchatka peninsula in extreme northeast Russia, \\"spewed an ash plume to about the 20,000-foot level in late January,\\" the agency says. \\"It has been deposited in a widespread area, including Washington and Oregon.\\" But in an updated post, emergency officials say it could be as a result of various reasons. \\"While the substance is likely ash is from Volcano Shiveluch, they are a number of volcanoes that are currently active,\\" they say. \\"The source of the material has not been scientifically confirmed.\\" And the ash may be from another part of the world. \\"The strong southerly flow from the jet stream could have brought it from an active volcano in southwest Colima, Mexico. But if we go farther west towards eastern Russia, there's another active volcano there,\\" says CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. The Mexican volcano is near Guadalajara and erupted Wednesday. The distances between the volcanoes and the Washington/Oregon areas are staggering -- the Russian volcano is 4,000 miles away and the volcano in Mexico is more than 2,000 miles away. But there are some other theories floating around. \\"We have heard a few theories thus far including; volcanic ash from Mexico or Russia, dust picked up from last night's strong winds, or perhaps ash from last year's wildfires over SE Oregon/SW Idaho.

Harold Frederick Shipman (14 January 1946 - 13 January 2004) was a British general practitioner and one of the most prolific serial killers in recorded history. On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of fifteen murders for killing patients under his care. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with the recommendation that he never be released. The Shipman Inquiry, a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, which was chaired by Dame Janet Smith, examined Shipman's crimes. In March 1998, Linda Reynolds of the Donneybrook Surgery in Hyde, prompted by Deborah Massey from Frank Massey and Son's funeral parlour, expressed concerns to John Pollard, the coroner for the South Manchester District, about the high death rate among Shipman's patients. In particular, she was concerned about the large number of cremation forms for elderly women that he had needed countersigned. The matter was brought to the attention of the police, who were unable to find sufficient evidence to bring charges; the Shipman Inquiry later blamed the police for assigning inexperienced officers to the case. Between 17 April 1998, when the police abandoned the investigation, and Shipman's eventual arrest, he killed three more people. His last victim was Kathleen Grundy, who was found dead at her home on 24 June 1998. Shipman was the last person to see her alive and later signed her death certificate, recording \\"old age\\" as the cause of death.  In August 1998, taxi driver John Shaw, from Hyde, contacted the police, informing them that he suspected Shipman of murdering 21 of his patients. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left PS386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, and she went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed and when examined, was found to contain traces of diamorphine, often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict and showed them comments in his computerised medical journal, but a program on his computer showed they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will.  The police then investigated other deaths Shipman had certified, and created a list of 15 specimen cases to investigate. They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal doses of diamorphine, signing patients' death certificates, and then falsifying medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health.  Prescription For Murder, a 2000 book by journalists Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie, advanced two theories on Shipman's motive for forging the will: that he wanted to be caught because his life was out of control, or that he planned to retire at age 55 and leave the UK.  In 2003, David Spiegelhalter et al. suggested that \\"statistical monitoring could have led to an alarm being raised at the end of 1996, when there were 67 excess deaths in females aged over 65 years, compared with 119 by 1998.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How did he kill them?","output":"Harold Frederick Shipman killed his victims by administering lethal doses of diamorphine, a drug often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. After administering the fatal doses, he would sign the patients' death certificates and then falsify medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Red Rock West (1993) Nicolas Cage gets embroiled in a deadly crime without at first knowing it, and the dominos lead to increasing peril, adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn American West of the 1990s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and Cage pulls off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease.  Is the plot over the top? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazed, almost likable killer? Yes. Does Cage stand a chance? Well, you have to watch and see. It never lets up, and it took me by surprise the first time I saw it.

It is not possible to tell Although the statement \\"The men fight during the game\\" suggests that there is some level of conflict or interaction between the men in question, it doesn't provide enough information to determine their exact location or involvement. As a result, we cannot confidently assert that \\"The men are at the game.\\" Here is a more detailed explanation: 1. Insufficient information about the context: The given statement does not clarify the context in which the phrase \\"the game\\" is being used. Without knowing what type of game is being referred to (e.g., a sports match, a board game, or a video game), it is impossible to ascertain if the men's physical presence is necessary for participation. In a situation where the game is an online multiplayer video game, for example, the men might not be at an actual physical game location. 2. Ambiguity in the term \\"fight\\": The word \\"fight\\" can have multiple interpretations depending on the situation. It could mean a physical altercation, a verbal disagreement, or even a metaphorical clash, such as a competition or rivalry. In any case, its presence doesn't necessarily imply that the men are physically present at the game location. 3. Possibility of simultaneous events: Even if we do assume that \\"the game\\" refers to a physical location, such as a sports match, the statement does not provide enough evidence that the men's fight occurs while they are at the game. It is possible that the men are fighting nearby or elsewhere and happen to do so during a sports match taking place elsewhere. In conclusion, given the ambiguity and lack of context in the statement, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"The men are at the game.\\" Therefore, the correct response is \\"b. it is not possible to tell.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

Summarize this article: Hardliners have been on a political warpath this week after the first visit to Tehran by the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton. \\"Do you think our country has no order that you can go anywhere you want and see anyone you want to see?\\" the head of the judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, demanded on Tuesday night. Leading clerics from the holy city of Qom have now added their voice, accusing the West of \\"reviving the plot of the soft revolution\\", a reference to the widespread street protests - blamed on foreign powers - that were sparked by the disputed 2009 presidential election. When Baroness Ashton first landed in Tehran last weekend, moderate newspapers hailed her arrival as an \\"achievement\\" of the reformist President Hassan Rouhani. His Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has established a good working relationship with Europe's top diplomat during their months of negotiations which led to November's landmark interim deal on Iran's nuclear programme. Now Mr Zarif, as well as Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi, has been summoned to appear before parliament to answer questions. Hardliners have zeroed in on what is being denounced as Baroness Ashton's \\"controversial meeting\\". Their target is a small gathering with seven female human rights activists at the very start of her mission, which coincided with International Women's Day. The presence of Narges Mohammadi, the acting head of Iran's Centre for the Defenders of Human Rights, attracted some of the greatest attention. She has been to prison five times since her days as a student activist, and is now on bail. \\"The better Iran's relations with the world become, the more open the political climate in Iran becomes, and the more active our civil society,\\" Ms Mohammadi told me. Baroness Ashton spoke of \\"the great privilege to meet women to talk about issues for women in Iran and across the world,\\" as she stood next to Mr Zarif at a news conference on Sunday. On Wednesday, a small crowd of protesters, mainly from an Islamic Association of University Students, gathered outside the residence of the Austrian ambassador in Tehran where the meeting with the female activists - meant to be a low-key discussion - was held the previous Saturday evening. \\"If Mrs Ashton is concerned about women and human rights, she should go take care of the women in Europe,\\" one student association declared earlier this week. \\"This backlash was to be expected,\\" a prominent editor of one of Iran's conservative media told me. \\"It will subside.\\" But it is also clear the deeply-rooted suspicion will not go away. Hardline politicians, still smarting from President Rouhani's emphatic victory in last year's elections, also see this as an opportunity to step up the pressure to try to weaken the reformist government, including negotiations on the future of Iran's nuclear programme. \\"They will try to keep the flame alive,\\" said one Iranian commentator. There has been less comment so far from more moderate media. But a cautious appreciation of her visit was quoted earlier this week. \\"It can have a positive effect on the process of Iran's nuclear talks and the promotion of our country's relations with the European Union,\\" remarked Ahmad Shohani, a member of the parliament's security and foreign policy committee. As we walked through Tehran's crowded bazaars this week, Iranians often asked us what kind of impact her visit would have. \\"When senior officials visit it gives us hope,\\" said Mehdi whose family has been in the carpet business for more than three decades. \\"When more junior officials come, we worry.\\" \\"We definitely welcome her visit,\\" emphasised a woman carrying bags of Iranian nuts and sweets in preparation for the upcoming Persian New Year on 21 March. \\"It's not good to live in isolation.\\" \\"Ashton and her friends should deal with the government,\\" insisted another man who lamented the high prices caused by years of international sanctions. \\"We cannot make a long wall around ourselves but the EU and the Iranian government have to show good intentions.\\" Baroness Ashton was clear from the start that human rights were an important part of her greater engagement with Iran. She often makes a point of talking to women wherever she visits. \\"She would have been criticised if she did not reach out to Iranian women, especially since it was International Women's Day,\\" commented one of her advisers. Her approach in Iran was carefully framed as a \\"potential human rights dialogue in future\\". European diplomats say the idea to put human rights on the agenda was first suggested by Iran's delegation during a meeting at the United Nations in September. Both Baroness Ashton and the Iranian leaders she met in Tehran have spoken positively about their talks earlier this week. \\"I've met people who've played a role in Iran, not just now but historically, and we were able to talk about the potential to do other things, including human rights,\\" Baroness Ashton told me and the few other journalists who came to cover her visit. After meeting her, President Hassan Rouhani spoke of the need to \\"interact constructively\\" with the entire world, including Europe, based on \\"common interests and mutual respect\\". His unofficial Twitter account @HassanRouhani used the hashtag #Constructive_Engagement. Mr Minister Zarif also spoke about the potential to co-operate in other areas, including action against drug trafficking from neighbouring Afghanistan, the battle against \\"terrorism\\", and the \\"dangerous\\" situation in Syria. But Baroness Ashton also made it clear that progress on any front would depend on the success or failure of difficult talks on a long-term comprehensive nuclear accord, which will resume on 17 March in Vienna. \\"I am leaving here knowing there is support for those who are going to come to negotiate,\\" she told me. \\"But there's so much to do and we have to be cautiously optimistic.\\" Even deeper scepticism was reiterated again this week by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \\"Our officials have started negotiations. We hope they will come to a conclusion but we are not optimistic,\\" he commented during one of his audiences. Ayatollah Khamenei has repeatedly warned that the nuclear talks are a \\"pretext in the hands of the West\\" to interfere in Iran's affairs. \\"Ashton has given some hope to the moderates, some food to the hardliners,\\" was how one Iranian observer summarised this rare visit by a senior Western official. \\"This is Iran.\\"","output":"EU Foreign Policy Chief, Catherine Ashton's, recent visit to Tehran sparked backlash from Iranian hardliners. Ashton's meeting with seven female human rights activists during her trip coincided with International Women's Day and drew criticism. The meeting attracted attention particularly due to the presence of Narges Mohammadi, the acting head of Iran's Centre for the Defenders of Human Rights. However, some believe this backlash is temporary and will subside. Regardless, deep-rooted suspicion towards relations with the West remains, with hardliners attempting to use the situation to weaken the reformist government and their negotiations on the future of Iran's nuclear programme."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Blazing Saddles Movie plot: In the American Old West of 1874, construction on a new railroad will soon be going through Rock Ridge, a frontier town inhabited exclusively by white people with the surname Johnson. The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, thereby lowering land prices. After he sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to shoot the sheriff and harass the townspeople, the townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy. With his quick wits and the assistance of recovering alcoholic gunslinger Jim, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder), Bart works to overcome the townspeople's hostile reception. He subdues and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking, but surprisingly philosophical henchman sent to kill him, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, Ku Klux Klansmen, and Nazi soldiers. Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart gathers the townspeople and the black and Chinese railroad workersâwho have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the communityâto build a fake town as a diversion. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town; but with no people in it, Bart realizes it won't fool Lamarr's villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \\"William J. Le PÃ©tomane Memorial Thruway\\", forcing the raiding party to turn back for \\"a shitload of dimes\\" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, Lamarr's villains attack the fake town... A:","output":"In the movie Blazing Saddles, the dummies in the fake town are not explicitly mentioned to be booby-trapped with any specific devices or explosives. However, the intent behind creating the fake town and the dummies is to serve as a diversion and delay tactic to confuse and stall Hedley Lamarr's army of thugs. By building the \\"William J. Le Pétomane Memorial Thruway\\" with a tollbooth, Bart, Jim, and Mongo are able to further delay the raiding party as they have to turn back for \\"a shitload of dimes\\" to pay the toll. When Lamarr's villains finally attack the fake town, they are not met with any direct booby traps, but they do engage in a chaotic and lengthy battle with the real townspeople and railroad workers, who are hiding behind the dummies. This clever plan allows Bart and his allies to face off against the villains on their own terms, strategically and with the element of surprise. In summary, the dummies in the fake town are not explicitly booby-trapped with any specific devices, but they serve as a key part of the plan to distract, confuse, and stall Hedley Lamarr's villains while the real townspeople and railroad workers mount a defense against them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: The Biden-Palin Debate - Forbes.com If the Republican National Committee has not already wired substantial sums into the Swiss bank accounts of Charles Gibson and Katie Couric, they were robbed. Their interviews with Sarah Palin, in which the Alaskan governor came out looking like a first-class ditz, are an example of what Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan used to call political jujitsu. Now, despite the imaginings of Democrats, the Republicans are nowhere near audacious enough to cook up a plot in which Palin, in the weeks before Thursday night's vice presidential debate, would be made to look like a fool so she could startle the debate audience with the news that she is not a fool at all. Palin looked unprepared in the interviews in large part because she was unprepared. Nonetheless, because of them, it was impossible for the Obama campaign to counter the expectation that she would implode right on stage. She did not implode. In this limited sense, she definitely won. Whether she won in a larger sense brings us to the matter of the cultural divide that runs as strongly as ever under the river of American politics. If you were disposed not to like Palin, you would say that Sen. Joe Biden spoke with considerably more sophistication about policy. You would argue that her answers, though improved from past performances, still sounded like talking points. You would say she was manipulative with her down-home stories, her shout-out, her ever-present hockey mom references and her cute little black suit with the big American flag--with rhinestones, yet. If you were disposed to like Palin, you would note that Biden, while informed, sounded like--well, a politician. You would argue that his answers, though spoken in a language familiar to the East and West coasts, were just as formulaic as hers. You would say that her ability to connect with her audience came not merely from manipulation but from the fact that her words and rhythms of speech really did mirror those of her audience. From the point of view of a cosmopolitan (including most visitors to Forbes.com), Palins performance did not compute. True, she held her own with Biden, meaningless voting statistic for meaningless voting statistic. Yet she spoke the mantras--personal responsibility, low taxes, good jobs, shining city on a hill--that seemed fundamentally inconsistent with the depth of experience needed to govern. Most of all, there was her voice. Bidens voice was sometimes passionate but let us understand that he had been there, done that. Palins voice was high, perky, earnest, naive, twangy, aw-shucks and altogether unreflective of the weariness, ironies ambiguities that we expect from a leader who has seen and understood the world. That was what Palins voice sounded like to cosmopolitans. Clearly, it did not sound that way to much of the country. Lots of Americans actually talk the way Palin talks (even some of us from Buffalo, which is pretty far east, have been asked to tone down the Midwestern accent). More, for many listeners, her phrases--its not our fault that the economy is hurting, but we have to learn the lessons so well never be taken advantage of this way again; there are blunders, but you cant keep pointing backward if you want to move forward--are not platitudes; they are meaningful indicators of how a leader will govern and are about as concrete as you can get in a presidential debate. If a participant in one of these debates ever actually outscored his or her opponent on substantive points, the winner would not be a good bet to lead the country. These debates penalize palpable ignorance but do not and should not reward expertise. They test whether a candidate can cite an array of plausible facts within a framework that speaks to the beliefs of listeners. As Disraeli put it more elegantly, Few ideas are correct ones, and what are correct no one can ascertain; but with words we govern men. No one knows how much Palins performance will help John McCains campaign. But if she is no longer an anchor on the campaign, it is because the debate showed--come to think of it, just as the bailout debate showed--that the country is a lot bigger than we sometimes fool ourselves into thinking it is. Suzanne Garment, a tax lawyer in New York, is the author of Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article discusses the vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin during the 2008 US presidential campaign. The author highlights the key aspects of their debate and how their performance conveys different messages to different audiences - cosmopolitans and the rest of the country. 1. Sarah Palin's unexpected performance: The author suggests that despite being unprepared in previous interviews, Palin held her own during the debate, defying expectations that she would implode on stage. 2. The cultural divide in American politics: The article emphasizes the different reactions to Palin and Biden's performances based on the pre-existing disposition of the audience. If one disliked Palin, they would see her as less sophisticated and manipulative, while Biden appeared more informed and experienced. However, if one liked Palin, they would view her as genuine and relatable compared to Biden, who might come across as a typical politician. 3. Communication style differences: The article points out the contrast in Biden and Palin's styles of speaking, with Biden reflecting a sense of familiarity and experience while Palin's voice conveyed a sense of earnestness and naiveté. 4. Importance of language in politics: The author refers to Disraeli's quote, \\"Few ideas are correct ones, and what are correct no one can ascertain; but with words we govern men.\\" This highlights the significance of language and rhetoric in shaping people's beliefs and views on leadership, emphasizing that the substance of the debate is less important than the delivery and perceived trustworthiness of the candidates. 5. Impact on the Presidential campaign: The outcome of the Palin-Biden debate had the potential to either lift or drag down John McCain's campaign. By not imploding during the debate, Palin may have removed herself as an anchor on McCain's campaign, demonstrating the complexities and vastness of American political culture. In summary, the most important aspects of this news article revolve around the contrasting performances of Sarah Palin and Joe Biden during their vice-presidential debate, the cultural divide in American politics, and the critical role language and communication play in shaping public opinion and influencing the presidential campaign."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, it seems that the user has mixed feelings about the product. While they appreciate the appearance and the functionality of the CD and cassette recorder, they express disappointment with the radio's sound quality, saying that it is so poor that they couldn't use it. Given this information, it is difficult to definitively say whether the user would recommend the product or not without knowing what aspects of the product are most important to them or other potential buyers. However, we can analyze the review further to speculate about the likelihood of them recommending the product overall. On the one hand, the user enjoyed the looks of the recorder, and both the CD and cassette recorder functioned well. These are positive aspects which may indicate that the user might recommend the product to someone who is primarily interested in a CD and cassette recorder with an appealing design. In this case, the poor sound quality of the radio may not be a deal-breaker for the user. On the other hand, the radio's poor sound quality is a significant issue highlighted by the user. This aspect could be a crucial factor for many potential buyers, as a radio with poor sound quality may not be fit for purpose. In addition, the fact that the user stated that they couldn't use the radio due to its sound quality is a strong negative point. This may lead to the user not recommending the product overall, especially to someone who is looking for a multi-functional device that includes a reliable radio. In conclusion, it is not explicitly clear whether the user would recommend the product based on the mixed feedback provided in their review. If the positive aspects, such as the design and functionality of the CD and cassette recorder, are more important to them or to other potential buyers than the negative aspects like the radio's poor sound quality, then they may recommend the product.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. From Texas to Tennessee, there's not much relief in sight for people smacked by a frigid winter storm that killed at least four, shut down schools, backed up interstates and left hundreds of thousands without power. The National Weather Service predicted more sleet and subfreezing temperatures in Dallas and Memphis until Sunday and in Little Rock, Arkansas, until Monday. Other parts of the country braced for bad weather. The storm moved east Friday night, with snow expected to accumulate across the central Appalachians through central New England into early Saturday morning. Snow or sleet was expected to hit Washington, D.C., on Sunday. Dallas/Fort Worth took the hardest hit. It was colder in the Big D (26 degrees) than in Anchorage, Alaska (34 degrees), prompting the cancellation of the Dallas Marathon and spurring Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to cancel almost 700 flights, about 80% of those scheduled. About 200,000 customers lost electricity, and a local official urged people to offer shelter to those without power. Southbound Interstate 35 was shut down and traffic backed up for six miles, CNN affiliate WFAA in Dallas reported. The temperature swings were startling. Hot Springs, Arkansas, experienced a record high of 75 on Wednesday. By Friday morning, the city was in the middle of an ice storm. The storm caught a lot of Texans by surprise. Debra Knight, a CNN iReporter, said she ran her defroster 20 minutes but couldn't get rid of the thick layer of ice on top of her car in Dallas. \\"This is Texas. We don't have snow tools!\\" said her husband, Bobby. Storm deaths. In some cases, the weather has been deadly. In Texas, a passenger was killed Thursday in Hockley County when a vehicle lost control and crashed into another car, Sgt. Bryan Witt of the Texas Department of Public Safety said. An Arkansas man was killed late Thursday when a tree fell on his camper in Pope County, Tommy Jackson, an Arkansas Department of Emergency Management spokesman, said Friday. Jackson said the death was related to the weather but couldn't provide details about the weather at the time. Rain and freezing rain were reported in the area Thursday night. Highway Patrol officials in Oklahoma blamed at least one death, in Muskogee, on the weather. The agency initially said weather had caused another death, that of a 24-year-old man in Owasso, but later said this fatality \\"is still under investigation and may not be winter storm related.\\" No snow had fallen in New Mexico, but drivers dealt with snow and ice. One person died in a semi crash near Clines Corners. About 116 storm-related injuries have been reported in Oklahoma, including 48 falls, the state health department said. When not causing harm, the storm struck fear in residents. In Dallas, iReporter Earl Wallace IV said he when he heard a loud crack and a rush of wind and ran out to find a large tree had fallen on two nearby homes. \\"One of the homeowners emerged crying and talking on the phone,\\" said the 32-year-old creative director. \\"The tree had crashed down into her dining room. I felt nervous, shocked and scared for the families inside.\\" Two homes were damaged -- one with a giant hole in the roof -- but no one was injured. WFAA in Dallas reported that a portion of the Pier 121 Marina in Lewisville collapsed on top of boats. Two people were taken to hospitals when a carport collapsed in Fort Worth. Getting ready. In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas and Water has 426,000 customers and is preparing for the worst. As of early Friday afternoon, about 5,000 customers were without power. \\"MLGW employees have been monitoring this winter storm situation, and we have all of our resources in place should the winter weather hit Memphis and Shelby County,\\" said Jerry Collins Jr., the company's president and CEO. \\"If indeed a significant storm blankets our city, we are ready to respond.\\" Memphis called off the annual St. Jude Memphis Marathon, which was scheduled for Saturday. The ice also makes travel messy. Road crews in Memphis are ready to throw down 4,000 tons of sand to give drivers traction, CNN affiliate WMC reported. The governors of Tennessee and Arkansas declared states of emergency ahead of the worst of the storm. \\"The most unsettling aspect about Arkansas' weather for most of us is its looming uncertainty,\\" Gov. Mike Beebe said. \\"During severe weather season, we know when conditions are ripe for tornadoes but never exactly where and when they could strike. In winter, that uncertainty takes a different form but can still create widespread anxiety,\\" he said. \\"Often, only a few degrees above or below the freezing mark can make the difference between a cold rain, a blanket of snow, an ice storm or a mixture of all of the above.\\" In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, roads were passable overnight, but it was a fine line as temperatures slipped below freezing. The slushy mess slowly turned into crunchy, bumpy ice. Police urged caution for anyone on the road and reported 21 major car accidents and 32 minor ones Friday. According to energy provider Oncor, more than 200,000 customers were without power in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area as of Friday morning. This is the largest concentration of outages, with scattered outages elsewhere in the state. Nearly 30,000 were without power in Arkansas, energy companies reported. The weather brought traffic at Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport almost to a standstill. Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed, prompting Southwest Airlines and American Airlines to urge travelers to consider rebooking their flights. A dark cloud over Dallas events. The National Weather Service predicts a wintry mix of precipitation through Sunday. That forecast prompted the cancellation of a downtown Dallas holiday parade scheduled for Saturday for the first time in 26 years. The city also called off its annual marathon slated for Sunday and the accompanying Health & Fitness Expo scheduled for Friday and Saturday. \\"We regret that the race will not go on as planned, but are confident this decision is in the best interest of our runners, volunteers, spectators and the general public,\\" A Dallas Marathon statement said. While the focus Friday was on the ice storm stretching from Dallas to Memphis, Mother Nature looked ready to throw another punch. A wintry mix was forecast for Washington beginning about noon Sunday. The National Weather Service said it has the potential to be an ice storm from late Sunday afternoon through the evening hours, but temperatures are expected to rise above freezing by rush hour Monday. A new storm entered the West, bringing snow to the Pacific Coast on Friday. The storm brought significant snowfall to Portland, Oregon, and there is a chance for rare snow in Las Vegas on Saturday. This storm will bring another round of wintry weather to the East by late in the weekend. CNN's Jason Morris, Ralph Ellis and Dave Hennen contributed to this report.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Movie title: The Presidio Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At the Presidio Army base in San Francisco, MP Patti Jean Lynch (Jenette Goldstein) is shot dead while investigating a break-in on the base and two San Francisco Police officers are killed in the getaway. Jay Austin (Mark Harmon), a San Francisco police inspector, is sent to investigate. He clashes with Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell (Sean Connery), the base Provost Marshal. Years ago, Austin and Lynch were partners while serving as MPs and Caldwell was their commanding officer. When Austin arrested Lieutenant Colonel Paul Lawrence (Dana Gladstone), Caldwell didn't support him. In the aftermath, Austin was demoted and decided to leave the army. Austin and Caldwell share a mutual dislike for one another. The murder investigation casts suspicion on Lawrence, as Lynch was killed with a Tokarev, a Russian pistol. Lawrence is the registered owner of a Tokarev, but claims he lost it in a poker game. Austin also learns that the getaway car used by Lynch's killer was registered to a civilian named Arthur Peale (Mark Blum), who is wealthy and owns a holding company that, in turn, owns other companies. Austin tries to question Lawrence about the Tokarev, but Caldwell intervenes. This fuels Austin's suspicions that Caldwell will do anything to protect a fellow officer from civilian authorities, even if he is a killer. Recognizing that part of the case is under Caldwell's jurisdiction at the Presidio and part is under Austin's jurisdiction in San Francisco, they uneasily team up to investigate the case. Caldwell states that if the Tokarev bullet that killed Lynch were to match a bullet fired earlier from Lawrence's Tokarev at the Presidio firing range, then Caldwell will arrange for Lawrence to surrender to Austin for arrest. In the meantime, Caldwell and Austin visit Peale, who claims his car was simply... A:","output":"In the movie \\"The Presidio,\\" MP Patti Jean Lynch was killed with a Tokarev, a Russian pistol. The murder investigation casts suspicion on Lieutenant Colonel Paul Lawrence, who is the registered owner of a Tokarev. However, Lawrence claims that he lost it in a poker game. The film's plot revolves around the strained relationship between San Francisco police inspector Jay Austin and Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell, the Presidio Army base's Provost Marshal. The two share a mutual dislike and background, as they were once partners while serving as MPs, and Caldwell was Austin's commanding officer. Caldwell's refusal to support Austin in a previous incident involving the arrest of Lawrence resulted in Austin's demotion and departure from the army. As the murder investigation progresses, suspicion intensifies around Lawrence due to his connection with the murder weapon. Additionally, Austin discovers that the getaway car used by Lynch's killer is registered to a wealthy civilian named Arthur Peale. Peale owns a holding company involved in various businesses. Austin's attempt to question Lawrence about the Tokarev is blocked by Caldwell, which increases his suspicion that Caldwell will protect a fellow officer from civilian authorities at any cost. Caldwell and Austin eventually recognize that their jurisdictions overlap - part of the case falls under Caldwell's authority at the Presidio and part under Austin's authority in San Francisco. This forces them to form an uneasy partnership to investigate the case. During their investigation, Caldwell proposes that if the Tokarev bullet that killed Lynch matches a bullet previously fired from Lawrence's Tokarev at the Presidio firing range, he will arrange for Lawrence to surrender to Austin for arrest. To further their investigation, Caldwell and Austin visit Peale, who claims his car was merely stolen, but his involvement remains ambiguous. While the central focus of \\"The Presidio\\" revolves around the murder investigation, the underlying theme hinges on the complicated relationship between Caldwell and Austin, as well as their individual efforts to solve the case and uncover the truth. Before deciding to invest in a film proposal like \\"The Presidio,\\" it is essential to consider various factors, such as the potential size of the audience, the uniqueness of the plot, the caliber of the actors involved, and the possibility of critical and commercial success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To do this, we'll subtract 24*h from both sides of the equation: 24*h - 24*h = 99*h - 24*h + 525 0 = 75*h + 525 Now we have the equation in the form 0 = 75h + 525.

Make sure to close the blinds on your window otherwise your room will warm up quickly & take a long time to cool off.  - Because the elevators (\\"inclinators\\") are slanted to the shape of the hotel, it's more like riding a subway car than a traditional elevator.  - Also, the elevators can make a lot more walking than you expect.

However, unlike a hotel where all the elevators are clustered in a centralized location, Luxor has an elevator bank in each of its four corners.  Your particular elevator will only be in one of then.

La structure de la taxe d'accise sur le tabac. Which language is this?","output":"This sentence is in French. It says, \\"La structure de la taxe d'accise sur le tabac,\\" which translates to \\"The structure of the tobacco excise tax\\" in English. Tobacco excise taxes are imposed on tobacco products to generate revenue and decrease tobacco consumption by making them more expensive. They are typically applied at the manufacturer, wholesale, or retail level and can vary based on the type, quantity, and price of the products being taxed. There are different types of excise tax structures for tobacco products. Here is a detailed explanation of some of the common structures: 1. Specific Excise Tax: This tax structure is based on the quantity or volume of tobacco products, such as the number of cigarettes, weight of rolling tobacco, or volume of e-liquids for vaping devices. Specific taxes are imposed per unit, for example, 1 per 20-pack of cigarettes or 0.50 per gram of rolling tobacco. The advantage of specific taxes is that they can be adjusted more easily to keep up-to-date with inflation or to achieve specific public health policy goals. 2. Ad Valorem Excise Tax: This tax structure is based on the value of the tobacco product, usually a certain percentage of the wholesale or retail price. An ad valorem tax takes into consideration the differences in quality and price of tobacco products and automatically adjusts as prices increase or decrease. For example, a 15% ad valorem tax on a 10 pack of cigarettes would be 1.50. One disadvantage of ad valorem taxes is that they allow lower-priced products to remain relatively cheap, which may not be as effective in discouraging tobacco consumption compared to specific excise taxes. 3. Hybrid Excise Tax: This tax structure combines the features of both specific and ad valorem taxes. A tobacco product would be subject to both a fixed tax per unit and a percentage tax based on its value. This approach aims to take advantage of the strengths of both types of taxes and improve the fairness and stability of revenue collection. For example, a hybrid tax might impose a 1 specific tax per 20-pack of cigarettes and also apply a 10% ad valorem tax on the price. 4. Minimum Excise Tax (MET): The MET structure aims to ensure that the total taxes on tobacco products do not fall below a certain amount, regardless of the specific or ad valorem taxes applied. This is done to discourage producers and retailers from lowering their prices to offset tax increases and maintain retail prices at a level that discourages consumption. 5. Tiered Excise Tax: This tax structure applies different rates to various categories of tobacco products based on specific criteria, such as price, quality, or type of product. For example, premium cigarettes could be subject to a higher tax rate than economy cigarettes, or cigars could have a different rate than cigarettes. This approach can increase the complexity of tax administration and have varying impacts on public health goals, depending on the differences between the rates. Each country or jurisdiction determines its preferred excise tax structure depending on various factors, including public health goals, revenue needs, and administrative capacity. Many countries use a combination of the tax structures mentioned above to optimize their strategies for reducing tobacco consumption and generating revenue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Review: /* slight spoilers */ Way back, before Evangelion was made, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans, and before Gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite, Gunbuster was made. With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time, and the famous Otakon shorts or course, Gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up. It didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before, space opera. Luckily, Gainax decided to put it out as a six-part OAV (direct to video) series. This allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film. This also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long, with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way. Besides that, they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam, and many other popular space operas. For one, the shows starts out pretty light, with Noriko in the Okinawa High School for mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little kid. This makes her life at the academy quite hard, as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors. The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school. Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (best girl in class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out. The middle bulk of Gunbuster leaves our female lead in space, focusing on both personal drama and action. A couple more characters are introduced, and parts of Noriko's past are dragged up again. Besides that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the Gunbuster, mankind's final hope, is presented. Smart as writer Okada was, he incorporated the principles of time dilation, to spice things up a bit. In short, time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. Also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated, when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base, who have aged considerably more than her. The science might not be perfect, but it's presented in a pretty believable way, with even some SD science theatre shorts in between the episodes, where Noriko, Kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series. The animation, for a series made in the 80s, is definitely good. The designs are retro 80s style of course, but it has it's charm. Animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice, although the costumes do betray some of the fanservice fascination Gainax will later exploit to the fullest. The mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too, with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and vast. The last episode was entirely done in black and white. While it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is suited perfectly for the latter part. The music is very typical space opera fair. Too bombastic in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. It does fit the series for the most part, but it can become quite annoying at times. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series he's worked on is Dragon Half. If you think 80s anime music, you will know what to expect. As the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this. Step by step the drama will be toned down, and the battles will take the front row. Neither aspect is ever left completely out though. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind, and with the last battle in sight, certain questions are presented to the audience, concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation. While they are never answered later on, they still present some interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic, with a nice, but quite predictable ending, though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course. Again, it fits the series. Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first, with alien invasions, huge battles, and some personal drama, and for the bigger part, it is. But it is done exceptionally well for a change. Instead of going for a steady mix of former elements, six episodes long, Gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism. Along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters, which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon. The show is very tightly written, although it does tend to slip up at some points. Overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided. Overall, the trip Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least it bend them a little. Highly enjoyable anime classic, but not without flaws. ***/***** What is the sentiment of this review?

Article: Store shelves are filling up with so-called \\"green\\" products promising to benefit the environment. A recent argument shows that it can be as difficult for buyers to confirm such statement as for producers to defend them. The argument concerns the GreenPlug Electricity Saver. The GreenPlug is supposed to prevent energy waste by electrical equipment whose constant -speed motors operate at less full load---as is especially true of older refrigerators. Research showed that such motors can be made to do the same work with less heat, noise, and power consumption just by lowering the voltage of the power supply.           John and Wyck Hay, started Green Technologies to apply that finding to home appliances. In  the USA, there are more than 140 million refrigerators in use, accounting for an average of 16% of  the household electric bill.  Two years of research resulted in the GreenPlug. Connecting between wall socket and refrigerator, the equipment contains a minicomputer that gives a motor full power (120 volts on average) for start-up, then reduces the power to 106 volts. Older refrigerators are the most overpowered and, thus, save the most energy with a GreenPlug. Refrigerators less than two years old are already energy-saving that a GreenPlug actually makes them waste electricity. The higher the voltage, the larger the difference a GreenPlug makes. Higher power costs shorten the payback time. The population-weighted national average is 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. But some residents in Washington State pay 1.5 cents. Some in Alaska pay 41.6 cents. Then come highly individual household differences like the number of children or refrigerator -opening age. All in all, the GreenPlug should save the average consumer 20 a year. Although the GreenPlug lowered the voltage as it was designed to do,Consumer Reports, an influential magazine, questioned how quickly---if ever---electricity savings due to the plug would repay its cost. People would be better off buying a new, high-efficiency refrigerator, the magazine... Question: We can infer from the passage that the author   _  .

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"While the suggested answer does provide information on the popularity and prevalence of egg rolls in American Chinese food, it does not directly address the main question of who invented egg rolls. Therefore, I would not recommend validating this answer as it is off-topic and not explicitly providing the information requested. To provide a more accurate and detailed response to the question \\"Who invented egg rolls\\": The exact origins of egg rolls are uncertain, though they are commonly believed to have evolved from the Chinese dish called \\"spring rolls.\\" Spring rolls have been a popular dish in China for centuries, particularly in the Guangdong province. They are typically filled with vegetables and occasionally meat, then wrapped in a thin dough and fried or baked. The transformation of spring rolls into egg rolls occurred when Chinese immigrants came to the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries. To adapt to local ingredients and preferences, these Chinese cooks modified the original spring roll recipe by using a wheat flour-based wrapper instead of the traditional rice paper and incorporating a variety of fillings, such as cabbage, bean sprouts, and various meats. This resulted in a new creation called the \\"egg roll.\\" Despite these modifications, the exact person who invented the egg roll remains unknown. The dish was popularized in American Chinese restaurants starting in the early 20th century and has continued to gain widespread acclaim for its crispy texture and delectable combination of ingredients. In conclusion, although we cannot credit the invention of egg rolls to a specific individual, they were developed by early Chinese immigrants in the United States who adapted the traditional spring roll recipe to cater to Western palates.

When Katie told me how she 'd gotten out of the fire , I did n't really know what to say there . Yeah , the cynic might say , \\" Well , she was dreaming , or hallucinating , or whatever , \\" but I ca n't say that . If my girl says God helped her get out of that burning house , then I have to accept that at face value . Think about it . Question How would one describe Katie 's outlook on life ? Answer:","output":"To describe Katie's outlook on life, it would be necessary to consider various aspects of her personality, beliefs, experiences, and the way she perceives and interacts with the world around her. Based on the given context, one can infer several key points that can help shed light on her outlook on life: 1. Faith and Spirituality: Katie is a person who appears to have a strong sense of faith and spirituality. She believes that God played a role in helping her escape the fire which indicates that she sees a divine presence in her life and possibly in the world around her. This belief in a higher power guiding her and providing support during difficult times showcases her trust in the unseen and her faith being a core aspect of her outlook on life. 2. Resilience and Courage: Facing a life-threatening situation like escaping a burning house is no easy feat. Katie's ability to successfully get out of that situation demonstrates her resilience and courage in the face of adversity. This trait could very well be a major part of her outlook on life, as it highlights her strength of character and her will to overcome obstacles. 3. Gratitude and Humility: Acknowledging that God helped her escape the fire suggests that Katie is a humble person who is appreciative of the help and support she receives, whether it is divine or human. This sense of gratitude and humility reflects her ability to recognize the importance and value of external factors and their impact on her life. 4. Openness and Honesty: The fact that Katie shared her experience of escaping the fire with the narrator shows that she is open and honest about her emotions and experiences. This openness likely extends to other aspects of her life as well, suggesting that she values authentic connections and genuine relationships. 5. Positivity and Optimism: Believing that a divine intervention helped her escape the fire shows a positive and optimistic outlook on life. Katie possibly focuses on the good in every situation and uses her faith as a source of strength and motivation. This optimism is likely to be a defining characteristic of her outlook on life. In conclusion, Katie's outlook on life can be described as one based on faith, resilience, gratitude, humility, openness, honesty, positivity, and optimism. Her experiences and beliefs are intertwined to create a unique perspective influenced by her spirituality and the way she navigates through life's challenges. This outlook not only shapes her personal growth but also impacts her relationships and the way others perceive her, as seen in the narrator's acceptance of her belief in divine intervention."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: If this was the film that was playing, I think I would give that walk a go. This has to be the worst film that Jodie Foster has ever done, and not because her acting was poor. On the contrary, she was fine for the role; however, the writing and plot were terribly formulaic. From the second of the aforementioned quote it was evident to see where the film was headed, and it did not derail from the predestined outcome. While the premise was frightening, the thriller aspect of this film just did not convey. In fact, it came across flat out hokey in several spots. I adore both Foster and Sarsgaard, but how many times has she played a victimized overprotective mother, exactly? Often enough that she should have it down by now--and she does. Sarsgaard, though, seemed bored with his lines, all but delivering them between yawns. The only real star in this film was the six year old daughter, played by Marlene Lawston. Too bad she had so little time. Answer: A:","output":"No"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: How does Optimus disable the Space Bridge? Title: Transformers: Dark of the Moon Movie plot: During the final days of the war that devastated the planet Cybertron, a spacecraft known as The Ark attempted to escape. Piloted by the great Autobot leader named Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy), the ship was said to contain special items that could help the Autobots win the war over the Decepticons. However, the ship was hit by enemy missiles, and the ship and its crew were lost into the far reaches of space.In 1961, the crash of the Ark on the moon is detected by NASA. Fearing that the Russians may beat them to finding out what this unidentified object is, President John F Kennedy pushes for NASA to land men on the moon to investigate. 8 years later, in 1969, Apollo 11 lands on the moon, and astronauts Neil Armstrong (Don Jeanes) and Buzz Aldrin (Cory Tucker) secretly explore the craft. They return with samples and pictures, and future moon missions bring back more information, before the manned moon missions are cancelled.In the present day, The Autobots are still working with the NEST Team to track down Decepticons loose on the planet, as well as anything unusual. While the Autobots Bumblebee, Sideswipe, Enzo, and Que attempt to take out an illegal Middle-Eastern nuclear plant, Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) is informed by a Ukranian official, Alexi Vokshod, about something strange going on around the Chernobyl disaster site. Lennox leads a team along with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) into the radioactive site. Inside the plant, Prime discovers a fuel cell from the Ark, and something even more shocking: the Decepticon Shockwave (Frank Welker) and a giant drilling robot at his command. After a short fight, Shockwave and the driller retreat. During the battle, a Decepticon assassin, Laserbeak (Keith Szarabajka), ambushes Vokshod kills him.Eventually, Prime and the other Autobots return to NEST's headquarters.

Solve 7*x + 0*x = 0 for x.","output":"To solve the equation 7*x + 0*x = 0 for x, we need to first simplify the equation to make it easier to work with.  First, let's recall that any number multiplied by 0 is equal to 0. In this case, the term 0*x can be simplified to 0 as: 0*x = 0 Now, we are left with a new equation: 7*x + 0 = 0 We can further simplify it by eliminating the \\"+ 0\\" term from the equation, because adding 0 to a number doesn't change its value. Therefore, our simplified equation is: 7*x = 0 Now, to solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by 7: 7*x / 7 = 0 / 7 x = 0 So the solution for the equation 7*x + 0*x = 0 is x = 0.

Summarize: The biggest risk of a Zika infection is not the infection, it is the potential complications that can develop as a result of the infection. Although complications only develop in a small minority of people, they can be severe. The two main complications that are suspected to be linked to the Zika virus are:  Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), which is a neurological condition that can lead to potential paralysis. Microcephaly, which is a birth defect that develops when women who are pregnant become infected with Zika. Infants born with microcephaly have an abnormally small head and may have developmental delays as well. Some infants may even die as a result of this birth defect. GBS has been linked as a potential complication of the Zika virus, but there is not yet a proven link between the two. Still, it is important to know the signs and symptoms of GBS if you have Zika. GBS is an autoimmune disorder that may occur following a viral infection such as Zika. It affects your nervous system by damaging the nerve coverings. Symptoms include:  Numbness in the lower extremities such as the feet, lower legs, and hands Difficulty moving Numbness and/or paralysis that gradually moves upwards Difficult breathing if the paralysis moves to the chest area Microcephaly in newborns has also been linked to the Zika infection in pregnant women (who then pass it on to their fetus in the womb). Microcephaly refers to an abnormally small head. This condition can lead to developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and, in severe cases, it may even lead to death.  When your baby is born, the doctors will take routine measurements of head circumference (both at birth, as well as at progressive intervals throughout your baby's growth). It is through abnormally small head circumference measurements that a doctor may diagnose your baby with microcephaly. Microcephaly is defined as a head circumference of less than 42cm at full growth. Doctors can use age-based growth charts to determine whether your baby's head circumference fits into the normal range at each developmental stage. If your baby is diagnosed microcephaly, it may be a sign that you have recently been infected with the Zika virus. However, GBS is treatable, so see a doctor as soon as possible if you think you have GBS. Microcephaly cannot be treated, but there are support strategies that may help your child reach as many developmental milestones as possible.","output":"The primary risk of a Zika infection lies in the possible complications that may arise, although they only affect a small percentage of people.

Haunting portrait of Andy Warhol goes on display By contrast, Neel's painting shows him posing with a corset around his stomach, which he wore to appear slimmer. Neel, whose career lasted from the 1920s until her death in 1984, was renowned for delving into the inner psychology of her sitters and for being an astute, and sometimes brutal, observer of people. Usually surrounded by celebrity friends and hangers-on from his Factory studio, Warhol, who was in his early 40s when the portrait was painted, is depicted sitting alone on a bare couch in Neel's New York studio. The painting is one of more than 60 of Neel's works that will go on show from July 8 at the Whitechapel Gallery in east London, which is staging Alice Neel: Painted Truths, the first major retrospective of her work. Jeremy Lewison, the curator of the exhibition, said: \\"Warhol always put on an impenetrable persona but Neel was a persuasive woman. It is significant that he has his eyes shut, as he is trying to put up a barrier to the feelings of shame that he might have about his personal appearance, but Neel gets right to the heart of the subject. \\"Warhol always tried to present an outwardly perfect, passive exterior, but here she penetrates through that, painting him as grotesque and imperfect and more like he really was.\\" Andrew Neel, the artist's grandson, said that Neel was \\"an expert\\" at capturing the true spirit of her sitters. He said: \\"The Warhol is an astounding portrait, depicting him like a sacrificial lamb to the machine of celebrity pop culture. \\"It also shows that behind his veneer of fame, genius and money was a very isolated, sensitive and sad man, who was less enigmatic and more human than he ever let on.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A haunting portrait of Andy Warhol by Alice Neel, renowned for uncovering the inner psychology of her subjects, reveals a vulnerable side of the artist as he sits alone on a couch, wearing a corset.

Review: In my opinion, this movie's title should be changed from \\"Only the Brave\\" to \\"All About Lane\\". I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome. Although, I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita, and Jason Scott Lee were all great. However, the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie. Sorry Lane, you are just not a film actor. Stick to what you're good at - theater acting. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful... Why weren't they cast for that role? Another major problem with this film were its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers don't look like they were fighting German soldiers... let alone anyone. Granted this was a low budget feature, but since this was a war-based film, isn't it important to show some actually fighting? This film was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth a major distribution. What is the sentiment of this review?

Process: - Humans are born as babies - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die.  Question: suppose more adults become elderly happens, how will it affect LESS babies.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect. If more adults become elderly, it implies that the population is aging, and there will likely be a decline in birth rates as older individuals are generally past their child-bearing years. As a result, there will be fewer babies born to replace the older generation.  This decrease in birth rates will cause less overall babies, but it has less direct effect on the transition between babies becoming infants or the learning experiences of children. The proportion of babies turning into infants and children learning skills will remain largely unaffected by the increase of elderly individuals in the population. The population dynamics might change, but the stages of human development will still follow the same pattern. However, it is important to note that the context of the question might influence the answer. For example, if there are inadequate resources or support systems in place for the growing elderly population and fewer babies, the strain on society might indirectly affect the quality of life and development of children in a more profound way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Another English language form established in literature is the Dales.  - Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Was he an irascible individualist? What would this English-born author of The Rights of Man--and arguably the draughtsman of U.S. independence--have been like to meet? Convivial guru or pain in the backside? A new play in London sets out to tell Paine's story, but it never quite drills down into the humanity of the fellow, real or imaginary. The play, which is showing at the open-air Globe theater, is more a work of biographical history than imaginative drama. The character of brave, reckless, fight-picking Paine himself is distinctly undercooked. Onetime Norfolk staymaker Paine did not emigrate to the American colonies until he was 37. What drove him? If we sat down today with him over a beer, what would we make of the bloke? Was he a disrespectful hell-raiser who hated all authority? Given the way he warmed to George Washington, this seems unlikely. Was he funny, prone to moods, a womanizer, a talker, a natural hack journalist? Was he maybe even, well, unreasonable? Paine is back in fashion. Barack Obama quoted him at his presidential inauguration ceremony and now we have this play, \\"A New World.\\" It does not bother with the first 37 years of his life. Time constraints would make that impossible. As it is, the show lasts for three hours; any longer than that and the audience at the Globe would have started to protest. The theater is a re-creation of a Shakespeare-era playhouse and has remarkably uncomfortable seats. Furthermore, half the audience has to stand. It would have been good to show Paine as a young man. Were there incidents that molded his ideas? Was he always a free-thinker? Or was he pushed toward disenchantment by one particular injustice? No doubt such scenes were included in playwright Trevor Griffiths' original version of the story (the work has been 20 years in the making). That was five hours long. The edited play concentrates more on Paine's political campaigns than on his rebellion against organized religion (one anti-church line in the show won a cheer of support from an elderly woman in the audience). In addition to his printed polemics against British rule, Paine became involved in the French revolution. The second half of the production has him largely in Paris. He did not have a happy time with the Frenchies. He got on the wrong side of the revolutionary feuding and was imprisoned for more than 10 months in 1794. It is a lot to expect any dramatist to imagine the disenchantment and rage that the disowned prophet must have felt as he stewed in his Parisian gaol. Griffiths, a venerable old Leftie, seems more determined to pack in historical facts than dwell on Paine's personal dilemma. Historically, this was no doubt the more honorable option, but a little imaginative juice in these scenes would have made the play more watchable. Griffiths ends his play with a prediction that Paine's revolution will eventually reach Britain. Given his Marxist past, he presumably wants the British monarchy to be overthrown. Watching the story of Tom Paine, however, it struck me that if he came back to modern Britain he would be more likely to agitate against the modern, quasi-colonial power of the European Commission. As in mid-18th century America, there are here today irritating questions of taxation and representation and the imposition of rules by an absent landlord elite. In today's Blighty, some of us feel as resentful of Brussels as Benjamin Franklin and his associates did about London. It so happens that Norfolk, Paine's old county, is a strong area for right-wing \\"Eurosceptics\\" who want Britain to tell our European masters where to go. If Paine was alive today, might he not stay at home and join enthusiastically in this fight for independence?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? aimlessness","output":"The sentiment of the single word \\"aimlessness\\" can be considered negative. However, it is essential to understand the context and emotions associated with this word, as sentiment analysis is majorly dependent on the context in which a word or phrase is used. Aimlessness refers to the lack of purpose, direction, or goals. It denotes a state where a person or entity does not have any clear objectives or aims, often leading to feelings of uncertainty, confusion, and in some cases, despair. These emotions and associated states are generally viewed as negative. The negativity of aimlessness arises from several factors, such as: 1. Inability to make progress: Without a clear purpose or direction, it's difficult for individuals or groups to make advancements, be it professionally, academically, or personally. 2. Reduced motivation: Aimlessness can lead to a lack of motivation since there are no clear objectives to work towards. This can impact productivity and create depressive feelings. 3. Wasted resources: In the case of organizations, a lack of direction can lead to inefficiencies and wasted resources, which are often viewed as unfavorable. 4. Hindered personal growth and self-awareness: For individuals, experiencing aimlessness can impede personal growth and self-awareness development, which are essential for overall well-being and a sense of fulfillment. 5. Emotional distress: Prolonged periods of aimlessness can result in emotional distress, including feelings of unhappiness, dissatisfaction, or even anxiety and depression. In general, while the word \\"aimlessness\\" is not explicitly a positive or negative term on its own, the emotional and situational context it represents is often associated with negative feelings, states, and outcomes. Therefore, we can consider the sentiment of the word \\"aimlessness\\" to be negative without additional context.

It is important to give a bit more context regarding Domagk and his accomplishment for a more detailed answer: Gerhard Domagk was a German pathologist and bacteriologist who made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of medicine. In 1932, Domagk discovered that a chemical compound called Prontosil, which was a red dye, had powerful antibacterial effects and could be effective in treating streptococcus infections. This marked the emergence of the first commercially available, synthetic antibacterial drug, which ultimately led to the development of the sulfonamide class of antibiotics. Domagk's discovery was of immense importance, as it revolutionized the way bacterial infections were treated and opened the door to the modern era of antibiotics. As a result, for his contribution to the field of medicine, Domagk was awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1939. The Nobel Prize is a highly esteemed international award that recognizes individuals for their outstanding achievements and contributions in various fields, including medicine.

Hilbert's seventh problem is one of the 23 famous mathematical problems posed by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1900 at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. These problems served to guide mathematicians for much of the 20th century, and many of them are still actively being researched today. The seventh problem specifically deals with transcendental numbers, which are numbers that are not the root of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. In other words, a transcendental number is a number that is not an algebraic number. Some examples of transcendental numbers include π (pi) and e. The problem can be formulated as follows: Given two algebraic numbers a and q (where a ≠ 0,1 and q is an irrational number), is the number a^q (a raised to the power of q) always transcendental? The British mathematician Alan Baker made significant progress towards solving the Hilbert's seventh problem in the 1960s. Baker's work focused on what is now known as the linear forms in logarithms, a method that had been previously utilized by the French mathematician Charles Hermite and the German mathematician Carl Siegel. In 1966, Baker published a groundbreaking paper that proved a theorem that would later become the foundation for answering the seventh problem. Baker's theorem states that any linear form in logarithms of algebraic numbers has a transcendental value, provided that it is not 0. This theorem essentially gives an upper bound on how well a non-zero algebraic linear form can approximate a transcendental value. By using this theorem and applying it to a broad class of numbers, Baker was ultimately able to prove that a^q is indeed transcendental when both a and q are algebraic, and a ≠ 0,1. This groundbreaking result resolved the open question of transcendence on the class of numbers described by the seventh problem. For this significant contribution to the field of mathematics, Alan Baker was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970, which is considered one of the most prestigious awards in mathematics. His work continues to be foundational in number theory, particularly in the study and understanding of transcendental numbers and Diophantine equations."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -23 = -3t - 26 for the variable t, we need to isolate t. We follow the principles of algebra in order to do this.  Here are the steps: 1. Firstly, let's try to take all constants terms to one side of the equation. Now, by adding 26 to both sides, we get an equation without any constant term on the right side. It will look like -23 + 26 = -3t - 26 +26. Simplified, that's 3 = -3t. 2. Once we have it simplified, our objective is to get t by itself. To isolate t, we should divide each side of the equation by -3. It will look like 3/-3 = -3t/-3. Simplified to -1 = t. So the solution to this equation -23 = -3t - 26 is t = -1. This means if we substitute t = -1 into the original equation, we should get the true statement. If we check it, -23 = -3*(-1) - 26 = 3 - 26 = -23, so -23 = -23, confirming that t = -1 is indeed the correct solution."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is it possible to ask a demon to possess an item (e.g., a painting or a doll)? If so, how? Is it possible for an animal to be possessed by a demon? Are there any reports of this happening? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same?  A). no;  B). yes;","output":"A) Is it possible to ask a demon to possess an item (e.g., a painting or a doll)? If so, how? The idea of demons possessing items comes from folklore, mythology, and religious beliefs rather than scientifically verifiable evidence. Belief in demons varies across cultures and religions, with various theories on how they interact with the physical world. While there is a longstanding history of stories describing instances of inanimate objects and places becoming haunted or possessed, it is crucial to note that these accounts are anecdotal and largely based on personal beliefs. For those who entertain the possibility of a demon possessing an item, there are several methods believed to encourage or compel a demon to possess an object. These methods typically involve ritualistic practices and might include: 1. Invocation or summoning: This is the process of calling upon a specific demon to request possession of an item. It often involves rituals, incantations, and the use of symbolism associated with the demon. 2. Creating a suitable vessel: Some believe that in order to attract a demon, an object must be made receptive or appealing to the entity. This may involve creating a vessel containing symbolism, engravings, or materials that match the demon's attributes. 3. Offerings and sacrifice: In some belief systems, offering sacrifices to a demon can be seen as a form of appeasement or invitation, essentially welcoming the entity to possess an object. 4. Using cursed or haunted objects: Introducing an object believed to be already cursed or containing demonic energy to the desired item can be seen as a way of transferring the demonic presence. It is important to remember that these practices are based on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs, with no scientific evidence to validate them. B) Is it possible for an animal to be possessed by a demon? Are there any reports of this happening? In the context of folklore, mythology, and religious beliefs, it is possible for animals to be thought of as 'possessed' by a demon, though this concept is also not scientifically verifiable. Reports of animals supposedly possessed by demons can be found in various religious texts and historical accounts. For instance, the Bible references a case where Jesus exorcized demons from a person and allowed them to enter a herd of pigs, which then drowned in the sea (Mark 5:1-20). In various cultural myths and stories, animals have been linked to demonic or supernatural forces. Animals such as black cats, wolves, and ravens have often been considered as symbols or manifestations of demonic entities. However, these beliefs are rooted in folklore and superstition, rather than empirical evidence. Throughout history, there have been anecdotal reports of animals deemed to be \\"possessed\\" or under the influence of evil spirits. These cases often involve unusual or aggressive behavior from animals that have chosen to interpret these events as demonic possession rather than looking for rational explanations. Modern understanding of animal behavior and psychology has minimized the likelihood of attributing strange animal actions to demonic possession. However, some individuals and groups still adhere to these traditional beliefs. To answer the multi-choice problem: A) No, these questions are not the same. They address different aspects of the concept of demonic possession. The first question pertains to the possibility of a demon possessing an item, while the second concerns the possibility of an animal experiencing possession. Although both subjects involve the idea of demonic possession, they explore different targets of possession and are not the same question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  Paragraph: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend studied less about carbon dioxide?

The plan for was hatched by Jaan Anvelt and Karl Rimm. The latter was a veteran of the Russian Civil War. The plan envisaged the main attack aimed at Tallinn, with subsequent coups in Tartu, Narva, Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere, Kunda, and Kohila. The revolt was supposed to start at 5:15 a.m. The 279 communists, mostly infiltrated from the Soviet Union, were armed with 5 Thompson light machine guns, 55 rifles, 65 hand grenades, 8 explosive devices and 150 pistols. It was mistakenly expected that the workers and soldiers would join the insurgency and would seize power in the capital together. The plan called for the establishment of an Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and of a \\"working people's government\\". Most of the schemes were spoiled by the Trial of the 149 in November 1924, which eliminated many potential communist organisers.

The story revolves around Count Almaviva, who seeks the love of the beautiful Rosina and enlists the help of the clever barber, Figaro, to win her heart. They work together to get around Rosina's guardian, Dr. Bartolo, who also has romantic intentions towards her. Rossini's opera features several well-known musical numbers, such as Figaro's famous aria \\"Largo al factotum,\\" which showcases the character's wit and charm, as well as Rosina's \\"Una voce poco fa,\\" where she introduces her strong, cunning personality. The masterful combination of comic situations, lively characters and beautiful music has made The Barber of Seville one of the most popular operas in the repertoire. It is often regarded as the epitome of Italian opera buffa and showcases Rossini's unique talent for creating memorable, energetic, and engaging music that captures the spirit of the story and characters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Locally, this period, called the \\"manor din\\" by the Assamese and \\"Chahi-Taret Khuntakpa\\" (seven years of devastation) in Meitei, is remembered with horror. It was the climactic period of the 600-year history of the Assamese kingdom. The sharp drop in population due both to depredations as well emigrations left the erstwhile kingdom in shambles. The British, who were earlier reluctant to colonise Assam, came into direct contact with a belligerent Burmese occupying force. Following the First Anglo-Burmese War they annexed not just Assam but also Burma.  - Borgohain (Ahom language: \\"Chao Thao Lung\\") was the second of the two original counsellors in the Ahom kingdom. He was selected by the Ahom king from members of the Ahom nobility (\\"Satgharia Ahom\\"), who was not eligible for the position of Ahom kingship. The other original counsellor is the Burhagohain. Both the positions existed from the time of the first Ahom king, Sukaphaa. The Borgohain administered the region south of the Dikhow river to Koliabor.  - Buragohain ( Ahom language : Chao Phrang Mong ) was the first of the two original counsellors in the Ahom kingdom . He was selected by the Ahom king from members of the Ahom nobility ( Satgharia Ahom ) , who was not eligible for the position of Ahom kingship . The other original counsellor is the Borgohain . Both the positions existed from the time of the first Ahom king , Sukaphaa . The Burhagohain administered the region north of the Dikhow river up to Sadia .  - The East India Company (EIC), also known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) or the British East India Company and informally as John Company, was an English and later British joint-stock company, which was formed to pursue trade with the East Indies but ended up trading mainly with the Indian subcontinent and Qing China.  - Assam (; \\"Ôxôm\\" ; \\"Asam\\"; \\"Âshám\\" ) is a state in northeastern India. Located south of the eastern Himalayas, Assam comprises the Brahmaputra Valley and the Barak Valley along with the Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao districts with an area of . Assam, along with Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, and Meghalaya, is one of the \\"Seven Sister States\\". Geographically, Assam and these states are connected to the rest of India via a strip of land in West Bengal called the Siliguri Corridor or \\"Chicken's Neck\\". Assam shares an international border with Bhutan and Bangladesh; and its culture, people and climate are similar to those of South-East Asia  comprising the elements in Indias Look East policy.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - The Treaty of Yandabo was the peace treaty that ended the First Anglo-Burmese War. The treaty was signed on 24February 1826, nearly two years after the war formally broke out on 5March 1824, by General Sir Archibald Campbell on the British side, and the Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side. With the British army at Yandabo village, only from the capital Ava, the Burmese were forced to accept the British terms without discussion.  - The First Anglo-Burmese War, also known as the First Burma War, (5 March 1824  24 February 1826) was the first of three wars fought between the British and Burmese empires in the 19th century. The war, which began primarily over the control of Northeastern India, ended in a decisive British victory, giving the British total control of Assam, Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia as well as Arakan Province and Tenasserim. The Burmese were also forced to pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling, and sign a commercial treaty.  - The Ahom language is a nearly extinct Tai language spoken by the Ahom people who ruled the Brahmaputra river valley in the present day Indian state of Assam between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The language is classified in a Northwestern subgrouping of Southwestern Tai owing to close affinities with Shan, Khamti and, more distantly, Thai. As the Ahom rulers of the area assimilated to the more numerous Assamese, the Indo-Aryan Assamese language gradually replaced Ahom as a spoken language, a process which became complete during the 19th century. As of 2000, Ahom was only known by approximately 200 priests of the traditional Ahom religion and only used for ceremonial or ritualistic purposes.  - Northeast India is the eastern-most region of India. It comprises of the contiguous Seven Sister States (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), and the Himalayan state of Sikkim. The Siliguri Corridor in West Bengal, with a width of , connects the North Eastern region with East India. The region shares more than of international border (about 90 per cent of its entire border area) with China (southern Tibet) in the north, Myanmar in the east, Bangladesh in the southwest, and Bhutan to the northwest.  - The Moamoria rebellion (17691806) was the 18th century conflict between the Morans, adherents of the Moamara Sattra, and the Ahom kings. This led to widespread popular discontent against the Ahom king and the nobles and to two periods in which the Ahom king lost control of the capital. Retaking the capital was accompanied by a massacre of subjects, leading to a steep depopulation of large tracts. The Ahom king failed to retake the entire kingdom, a portion in the north-east, Bengmara, became virtually independent.  - \\"Genealogically, Assamese belongs to the group of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages\\"  Assamese, Asamiya or Ôxômiya (Assamese: , \\"\\") is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language spoken mainly in the state of Assam, where it is an official language. The easternmost of the Indo-Aryan languages, it is spoken by over 13 million native speakers, and serves as a \\"lingua franca\\" in the region. It is also spoken in parts of Arunachal Pradesh and other northeast Indian states. Nagamese, an Assamese-based Creole language is widely used in Nagaland and parts of Assam. Nefamese is an Assamese-based pidgin used in Arunachal Pradesh. Small pockets of Assamese speakers can be found in Bangladesh. In the past, it was the court language of the Ahom kingdom from the 17th century.  - The Ahom kingdom (12281826, also called \\"Kingdom of Assam\\") was a kingdom in the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam, India that maintained its sovereignty for nearly 600 years and successfully resisted Mughal expansion in Northeast India. Established by Sukaphaa, a Tai prince from Mong Mao, it began as a mong in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra based on wet rice agriculture. It expanded suddenly under Suhungmung in the 16th century and became multi-ethnic in character, casting a profound effect on the political and social life in the entire Brahmaputra valley. The kingdom became weaker with the rise of the Moamoria rebellion, and subsequently fell to repeated Burmese invasions of Assam. With the defeat of the Burmese after the First Anglo-Burmese War and the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826, control of the kingdom passed into East India Company hands.  - Mong Mao, Möngmao or \\"Mao kingdom\\" (\\"Mong\\" is the etymological equivalent of Thai \\"Mueang\\", meaning nation) was an ethnically Dai state that controlled several smaller Tai states or chieftainships along the frontier of what is now Myanmar and China in the Dehong region of Yunnan with a capital near the modern-day border town of Ruili. The name of the main river in this region is the Nam Mao, also known as the Shweli River.  - Suhungmung (reign 14971539) (Swarganarayan, Dihingia Raja) (Assamese:  ) was one of the most important Ahom kings, who ruled at the cusp of Assam's medieval history. His reign broke from the early Ahom rule and established a multi-ethnic polity in his kingdom. Under him the Ahom Kingdom expanded greatly for the first time since Sukaphaa, at the cost of the Sutiya and the Kachari kingdoms. He also successfully defended his kingdom against the first Muslim invasions under Turbak Khan. During his time, the Khen dynasty collapsed and the Koch dynasty ascended in the Kamata kingdom. His general, Tonkham, pursued the Muslims up to the Karatoya river, the western boundary of the erstwhile Kamarupa Kingdom, the farthest west an Ahom king had ventured in its entire six hundred years of rule.  - The Ahom (Pron: , , people of Assam) are the descendants of the ethnic Tai people that accompanied the Tai prince into the Brahmaputra valley in 1228 and ruled the area for six centuries. Sukaphaa and his followers established the Ahom kingdom (12281826) and the Ahom dynasty ruled and expanded the kingdom until the British gained control of the region through the Treaty of Yandabo upon winning the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1826.

The establishment of the Santa Hermandad in 1480, and of the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia in 1500—a tribunal and executive body directed by the Governor-Captain General as a direct representative of the King—implied initially the submission of the Kingdom to the Crown, after a century of unrest and fiscal insubordination. As a result, from 1480 to 1520 the Kingdom of Galicia contributed more than 10% of the total earnings of the Crown of Castille, including the Americas, well over its economic relevance. Like the rest of Spain, the 16th century was marked by population growth up to 1580, when the simultaneous wars with the Netherlands, France and England hampered Galicia's Atlantic commerce, which consisted mostly in the exportation of sardines, wood, and some cattle and wine.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A black dress mannequin, with a wooden leg stand, positioned next to a suitcase, and a female dressed in a gray sweater and black pants, reading a newspaper, in a crowded city square.\\" if \\"The people are outside.\\"?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"A black dress mannequin, with a wooden leg stand, positioned next to a suitcase, and a female dressed in a gray sweater and black pants, reading a newspaper, in a crowded city square\\" when given the premise, \\"The people are outside.\\" If the people are outside, it is logical that they might be gathered at a common, open-air location such as a city square. City squares are hubs for various human activities and gatherings due to their central location and accessibility. A scenario taking place in a crowded city square could entail numerous events, performances, and people, as well as objects on display, such as the black dress mannequin in this particular situation. A black dress mannequin could be present in the city square for multiple reasons. It could be part of an outdoor marketing campaign by a nearby clothing store, an art installation, or simply a mobile retail stand with a vendor selling dresses on-the-go. Since it is positioned next to a suitcase, the mannequin may be part of a temporary or mobile setup. The suitcase could hold additional merchandise or materials required for setting up, packing up, or moving the mannequin between locations. The wooden leg stand mentioned in the scene serves a functional purpose. It provides support for the mannequin, ensuring it remains stable and does not topple over due to wind, human interference, or any other factors. A wooden leg stand is a durable, yet lightweight option for outdoor use, making it a suitable choice for an outdoor setting such as a city square. The female dressed in a gray sweater and black pants, reading a newspaper, may be an average passer-by or a visitor taking a break from her daily tasks. She could be a tourist, a local resident, or an employee on her lunch break. By including a person in the scene, the description paints a more complete and dynamic picture of a typical city square bustling with people and activity. In conclusion, the description of \\"A black dress mannequin, with a wooden leg stand, positioned next to a suitcase, and a female dressed in a gray sweater and black pants, reading a newspaper, in a crowded city square\\" can be inferred from \\"The people are outside\\" by taking into account the common characteristics of city squares, which include diverse people, activities, and items on display.

Sentence 2: One of the most important towns of Roman Provence lies at the base of the western mountains of the region. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. While both sentences discuss the notion of an important town of Roman Provence, the information alluded to in both does not share the same alignment. The first sentence provides a precise geographical direction and distance from a certain point (Orange) to reach the town along a specific route (D975). It clearly indicates that the town is located 30 km northeast of Orange. Contrastingly, the second sentence mentions only that the town is situated at the base of the western mountains of the region, without specifying any direct relation to 'Orange' or the route 'D975'. The description conveyed in each sentence does not inherently support or confirm the other. Each sentence contains distinct geographical details about the location of the town, and neither of these details can be inferred solely based on the information from the other sentence. Thus, the assertion presented in the second sentence can't be definitively drawn from the information in the first one. To establish if the second sentence is definitively entailed by the first, it would, for example, need to say something like: \\"This town, lying 30 km northeast of Orange along the D975, is one of the most important towns of Roman Provence.\\" This way it's clear that the positional details given are uniformly applicable for the mentioned town in Roman Provence, thereby connecting and confirming the information in both sentences.

Gruber tells Keira about the pot growing in Keith's backyard. That night, Keira and Lisa decide to take some of Keith's pot. While leaving, they hear what sounds like Keith and his wife having sex. Sex crazed Lisa decides to take a closer look. When Kiera joins her, the two discover that Keith isn't with his wife but with Glory! Later that night, Glory arrives at the bonfire. Keira and Lisa tell Glory about seeing her with Keith. Glory defends her actions, saying she loves Keith and he loves her. The next day, while Keira works at the food stand, Glory tells her more about Keith and her relationship with him. Wheels begin to turn in Keira's head, and after debating with herself, she decides to go to Keith's. He thinks she wants to buy pot, but she tells him she will \\"babysit\\" too. She convinces him to let her in. He tells her he's married and she's half his age, but it is obvious both are attracted to each other.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The U.S. State Department has asked American embassies and consulates around the world to identify certain groups that should get extra scrutiny when they apply for visas. A series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas. The diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \\"population sets\\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S. Even if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial. It is the first evidence of a plan for the \\"extreme vetting\\" of foreigners entering the United States that President Donald Trump promised during his campaign. The four cables sent between March 10 and March 17 do not define which groups would be considered among the \\"population sets\\" requiring more scrutiny. But in the first glimpse into what \\"extreme vetting\\" may look like under the Trump administration, one of Tillerson's memos would have added to the interview process questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses and travel history going back 15 years, as well as all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years. The questions were withdrawn in a following memo, pending approval of the list by another federal agency. The directives, first reported by Reuters, quickly drew criticism from rights groups and others who've accused Trump of discriminating against Muslims through his now-suspended ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \\"These measures could provide license for discrimination based on national origin and religion,'' human rights group Amnesty International wrote in a letter to Tillerson on Thursday. \\"They...

Summarize this article: Search engines are good way to find content, discover websites, check up on news and do your shopping online. But one day soon they may be so much more than this, and may even end up saving your life.      According to Microsoft researchers, search engines have the potential of observing and warning you of disease and physical illness, based on your search history. Perhaps the most impressive such example, is when Microsoft’s Bing was able to infer that some of its users had pancreatic cancer, even before they were diagnosed. Dr. Eric Horvitz, one of Microsoft’s researchers leading the project, explained:      We asked ourselves ‘If we heard the whispers of people online, would it provide strong evidence or a clue that something’s going on?’[...] I think the mainstream medical literature has been resistant to these kinds of studies and this kind of data. We’re hoping that this stimulates quite a bit of interesting conversation.      This achievement has now been published in a research paper in The Journal of Oncology Practice, detailing how Bing could parse anonymized data and find clear search patterns for those suffering of pancreatic cancer. Based on the order, frequency and symptoms they were searching for Bing could determine which users were experiencing cancer-related symptoms, which queries were only prompted by curiosity or anxiety rather than an actual ailment, and which users were actually suffering from pancreatic cancer.      As Dr Horvitz hinted at, this isn’t the first time that big data and search engine queries have been used for medical research. A few years ago Google tried to track the spread of the flu virus across the US based on search queries. There’s also the famous case where a big retailer discovered a young woman was pregnant before her family did, based on her changing shopping habits.      But while Google’s attempt to use its search engine to track the flu turned out to be very inexact, Microsoft’s approach in this case seems to be a very robust one, with researchers being able to identify 5% to 15% of pancreatic cancer cases, with only one false positive per 100,000 cases.      Of course, this was a limited trial of the technology and algorithms involved; more of a proof of concept than anything else. But its results were encouraging and if they can be reproduced, perhaps to even greater accuracy, we might soon see our search engines offering health services.      One of Microsoft’s researchers even gave a tantalizing clue on the direction they want to head towards when he said “What might we do? Might there be a Cortana for health some day?”. He was referring to Microsoft’s own digital assistant powered by Bing, and the company’s already public efforts in utilizing personal data and machine learning to give health suggestions in its MS Health platform.      Source: Journal of Oncology Practice Via: NYT ||||| Abstract      Introduction: People’s online activities can yield clues about their emerging health conditions. We performed an intensive study to explore the feasibility of using anonymized Web query logs to screen for the emergence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The methods used statistical analyses of large-scale anonymized search logs considering the symptom queries from millions of people, with the potential application of warning individual searchers about the value of seeking attention from health care professionals.      Methods: We identified searchers in logs of online search activity who issued special queries that are suggestive of a recent diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We then went back many months before these landmark queries were made, to examine patterns of symptoms, which were expressed as searches about concerning symptoms. We built statistical classifiers that predicted the future appearance of the landmark queries based on patterns of signals seen in search logs.      Results: We found that signals about patterns of queries in search logs can predict the future appearance of queries that are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We showed specifically that we can identify 5% to 15% of cases, while preserving extremely low false-positive rates (0.00001 to 0.0001). ||||| Summary:","output":"A research paper in The Journal of Oncology Practice has detailed how Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, was able to determine from anonymised data which users were experiencing cancer-related symptoms - and even those suffering from pancreatic cancer - based on the order and frequency of search terms.

Answer the following question: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K. We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had.

What is the answer: Who directed the 2012 film 'Django Unchained'?","output":"The 2012 film 'Django Unchained' was directed by Quentin Tarantino, an American filmmaker, screenwriter, and actor. Quentin Tarantino is widely regarded as one of the most influential directors of his generation, known for his distinctive style, sharp dialogue, and unique blend of genres in his movies. Born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tarantino developed a love for movies at a young age. He later worked at a video store called Video Archives, where he was able to further fuel his passion for cinema, watching countless films and getting inspiration for his own career. Tarantino's directorial debut came in 1992 with the release of 'Reservoir Dogs,' which established his unique style and set the foundation for his successful career. He followed it up with 'Pulp Fiction' in 1994, which went on to become a massive hit and received numerous awards, including the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.  Over the years, Tarantino has directed several other acclaimed movies, such as 'Jackie Brown' (1997), the 'Kill Bill' series (2003 and 2004), 'Inglourious Basterds' (2009), and 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' (2019).  'Django Unchained,' released in 2012, was Quentin Tarantino's homage to the Spaghetti Western film genre. The film stars Jamie Foxx as Django, a freed slave who embarks on a mission to rescue his enslaved wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (played by Kerry Washington), from a brutal plantation owner, Calvin Candie (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio). Django is aided by a German bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz), who offers to help him in his quest in exchange for Django's assistance in capturing wanted criminals. The film is rich with Tarantino's trademark style, including intense and often violent scenes, sharp and witty dialogue, and a unique blend of dark humor and drama. 'Django Unchained' gained critical acclaim and performed exceptionally well at the box office. It received several nominations and awards, including five Academy Award nominations, with Christoph Waltz winning the Best Supporting Actor accolade. Overall, 'Django Unchained' serves as a stellar example of Quentin Tarantino's masterful storytelling and directing abilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

At the Monsters, Inc. factory, skilled individuals called \\"scarers\\" access the human world through closet doors in children's bedrooms, to scare the children, and harvest their screams. It is considered dangerous work, as human children are believed to be \\"toxic\\" to monsters. Energy production is falling because children are becoming more difficult to scare, and company chairman, Henry J. Waternoose, is determined to find a solution. James P. \\"Sulley\\" Sullivan is the organization's top scarer, but is engaged in a fierce rivalry with the chameleon-like monster, Randall Boggs. One day, Sulley discovers that Randall left a door activated on the scare floor, and a small girl has entered the factory. After desperate failed attempts to put her back, Sulley takes her home. His best friend, Mike Wazowski, is on a date with his girlfriend, Celia, and chaos erupts when the child is discovered. Sulley and Mike escape the Child Detection Agency (CDA) and discover that the little girl is actually not toxic. Sulley grows attached to her and names her \\"Boo\\". They smuggle her into the factory in an attempt to send her home. Randall, discovering Boo, tries to kidnap her, but instead kidnaps Mike. Randall reveals that he has built a large machine named \\"The Scream Extractor\\" in an attempt to extract all possible screams out of captured human children to help avert the company's production problems. Randall straps Mike to the machine, but Sulley unplugs it and reports Randall to Waternoose.
