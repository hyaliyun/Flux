The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. I am facing a new situation today: United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would Mojave Desert be less or more prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta? Answer:","output":"The Mojave Desert would be significantly less prone to hypoxia than the Mississippi Delta due to their contrasting geographical characteristics, hydrological conditions, and vegetation types. Firstly, let's consider the geographical characteristics of both sites. The Mississippi Delta is a vast wetland area created by the confluence of the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers. The region is known for its alluvial soil, which is fertile and supports a variety of plant life. On the other hand, the Mojave Desert is an arid region characterized by sparse vegetation, dry and sandy soil, and extreme temperature variations. Due to these differences, the Mississippi Delta is much more likely to experience flooding and waterlogging, leading to hypoxic soil conditions. Secondly, the hydrological conditions of the two sites are markedly different. The Mississippi Delta frequently experiences flooding and high water levels due to its low elevation and the presence of numerous waterways. In contrast, the Mojave Desert is a landlocked area with very little precipitation and an overall low water table. The minimal water availability in the Mojave Desert directly contributes to reduced chances of hypoxia development in its soils. Hypoxia is most commonly associated with waterlogged or flooded soil conditions where oxygen diffusion is impeded, and anaerobic conditions prevail. Given the arid nature of the Mojave Desert, these conditions are highly unlikely to occur. Lastly, the vegetation in the Mojave Desert and the Mississippi Delta differ in terms of their adaptations and ecological functions. Wetland plants in the delta, such as water-lilies, possess aerenchyma, which is a specialized tissue that allows the transport of oxygen from the atmosphere to the plant's roots in response to hypoxic soil conditions. This adaptation is crucial in allowing these plants to survive in wet, oxygen-poor environments. Conversely, plants in the Mojave Desert have evolved to survive in arid conditions and have developed adaptations that enable them to conserve water, such as shallow root systems and waxy leaf surfaces. Since desert plants do not typically require aerenchyma or similar adaptations to deal with hypoxia, this indicates that the Mojave Desert is less prone to hypoxic soil conditions. In conclusion, the Mojave Desert is far less prone to hypoxia compared to the Mississippi Delta due to the contrasting geographical characteristics, hydrological conditions, and vegetation types found in these two regions. The arid conditions, sparse vegetation, and minimal water availability in the Mojave Desert contribute to a significantly lower risk of developing hypoxic soil conditions compared to the waterlogged and frequently flooded soils of the Mississippi Delta."},{"instruction":"Q:Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: If I lived in a small village outside a city, which general geographic area would this be?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"If there is an abundance of food available for the caterpillars to consume, it can have several effects on the subsequent cocoon formation and hatching process, which can be classified as both direct and indirect impacts on the life cycle of a butterfly. Direct Impact: 1. Increased Growth Rate: With access to plenty of food, caterpillars will have a higher chance of growing faster and larger, as they can feed constantly without any limitations. This increased growth rate will allow them to reach the cocoon formation stage more quickly, increasing the overall number of cocoons over a given time period. 2. Improved Health and Survival Rates: Ample food sources will provide caterpillars with the essential nutrients they require to maintain good health and develop properly. This will directly impact their survival rates, ensuring that more caterpillars can successfully form cocoons and transform into pupae. Indirect Impact: 1. Enhanced Cocoon Formation: If caterpillars are properly nourished, their overall health will be improved, allowing them to create more robust and well-constructed cocoons. This, in turn, can have an indirect impact on the hatching process, as stronger and healthier pupae will be better equipped to emerge as butterflies. 2. Increased Butterfly Population: If more cocoons hatch due to increased food availability for caterpillars, the overall butterfly population will experience a boost. This can indirectly affect their reproductive success, with a more significant number of butterflies being able to mate and lay eggs, further perpetuating the cycle. 3. Changes in Ecosystem Dynamics: An increase in the butterfly population as a result of more cocoons hatching can have indirect effects on the local ecosystem, promoting changes in resource availability and predator-prey dynamics. This could lead to further impacts on the life cycle of the butterflies and other species within the ecosystem. In summary, the availability of ample food for caterpillars can influence the cocoon formation and hatching process through both direct and indirect impacts. Directly, it helps caterpillars grow faster and healthier, while indirectly, it can lead to more robust cocoons, increase the butterfly population, and impact the overall ecosystem dynamics."},{"instruction":"Q: Neurons are classified based on the direction in which they carry what?

Question: suppose less stormy weather occurs happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"A greater greenhouse effect can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including changes in weather patterns such as the occurrence of stormy weather. If less stormy weather occurs, it might have several implications that could lead to a greater greenhouse effect. A. More Here are some of the reasons why less stormy weather might lead to a greater greenhouse effect: 1. Reduced cloud cover: During stormy weather, clouds cover large parts of the sky, reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface. This can lead to lower surface temperatures, which might mitigate some of the greenhouse effect. If less stormy weather occurs, there would be reduced cloud cover, allowing more sunlight to reach the Earth's surface and increasing the temperature. This, in turn, could exacerbate the greenhouse effect. 2. Weaker ocean circulation: Stormy weather can help mix the surface and deep layers of the ocean, helping to distribute heat evenly throughout the ocean. This process is important for maintaining a stable climate and mitigating some of the impacts of the greenhouse effect. With less stormy weather, there might be weaker ocean circulation, leading to a greater concentration of heat at the Earth's surface, which could contribute to a greater greenhouse effect. 3. Altered precipitation patterns: Storms are important for redistributing water vapor in the atmosphere and providing much-needed rainfall to various ecosystems. If less stormy weather occurs, certain regions might receive less rainfall, leading to changes in regional climates and ecosystems. This disruption could affect the balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbed and released by these ecosystems, potentially exacerbating the greenhouse effect. 4. Reduced aerosol concentrations: Storms can also help remove aerosols, small particles suspended in the atmosphere, through precipitation. Aerosols can have a cooling effect on the Earth's climate by reflecting sunlight back into space and increasing the Earth's albedo (the proportion of sunlight that is reflected). With less stormy weather, there might be reduced removal of aerosols, leading to higher aerosol concentrations and potentially creating a greater greenhouse effect. In conclusion, less stormy weather could indeed lead to a greater greenhouse effect. Changes in cloud cover, ocean circulation, precipitation patterns, and aerosol concentrations could all contribute to more significant warming of the Earth's surface, exacerbating the impacts of climate change."},{"instruction":"Here is a dialogue: Harriet: have you heard the big news?

And she wanted to buy cabbage juice. And she saw a 16 ounce bottle for 6. She knew it was just cabbage and water. So she decided to buy her own juicer instead. Hypothesis: The market was where she was.","output":"Based on the given context, we can draw several hypotheses to analyze and interpret the situation presented. Here, I will provide a detailed and long answer, breaking down the hypothesis you have mentioned, and also offer alternative hypotheses. Hypothesis 1: The market was where she was. This hypothesis is evidently accurate given the context. Sarah was described to be at the market, where she attempted to purchase cabbage juice. The market is the location of her shopping experience, and it is where she discovered the 16-ounce bottle of cabbage juice priced at 6. Alternative Hypothesis 2: Sarah believed the cabbage juice was overpriced. The context suggests that Sarah thought the price of the cabbage juice was not reasonable, given that it is just a mixture of cabbage and water. Her decision to purchase her own juicer is an indication that she found it more cost-effective to make the juice herself instead of buying it at the given price. Alternative Hypothesis 3: Sarah values self-reliance and cost-efficiency in her purchasing decisions. Sarah's choice to buy a juicer rather than purchasing the cabbage juice implies that she values the idea of being self-reliant and cost-efficient. By investing in a juicer, she will have the ability to make her own cabbage juice at a lower cost per ounce, as well as explore other juicing options, ultimately saving money in the long run. Alternative Hypothesis 4: Sarah may be concerned about the quality or freshness of the pre-packaged cabbage juice. While not explicitly mentioned in the context, it is possible that Sarah also prefers homemade juice for reasons other than cost. Knowing that the pre-packaged juice consists only of cabbage and water, she may desire more control over its quality or freshness. By using a juicer to make her own cabbage juice, Sarah can ensure that her juice is made from fresh, high-quality ingredients and has not been subjected to preservatives or additives. In conclusion, based on the context, we can validate your initial hypothesis that the market was where Sarah was. Additionally, we can derive alternative hypotheses, which include the possibility that Sarah believed the cabbage juice was overpriced, values self-reliance and cost-efficiency, and may have concerns about the quality and freshness of the pre-packaged cabbage juice. These hypotheses contribute to our understanding of the overall situation and the reasons behind Sarah's decision to buy a juicer instead of the pre-packaged juice."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Now Boots the chemist is the latest home-grown brand to be sold off to an American firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion. US giant Walgreens already owns a 45 per cent stake in the British chain, which it acquired for £4billion in 2012. It is now set to buy the remaining 55 per cent to become the sole owner. End of an era: Boots is the latest British brand to be sold off to a U.S. firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion. Boots is the latest in a long line of well-known British brands to be sold off to foreign companies. US supermarket chain Walmart took over Asda in 1999, while Cadbury has been owned by American firm Kraft since 2010. Italian tycoon Stefano Pessina, the chairman of Boots, is set to make around £1.5billion from the deal. He and private equity firm KKR have owned the business since 2007. Walgreens and Boots have developed several joint initiatives over the past two years – for example, Boots’ popular No7 anti-ageing serums have been sold in the US by Walgreens stores. It is now possible the British outlets will stock more American brands, and may introduce US-style health screening clinics to allow customers to test their blood glucose or cholesterol levels. Walgreens bosses are planning a major cost-cutting exercise designed to save £594million by 2017, however it is unclear how this will affect the British firm’s 70,000 staff and 2,500 stores. Mr Pessina, 73, will be appointed executive vice chairman of the new business, called Walgreens Boots Alliance. He has described the deal as more of a ‘merger’ than an American takeover, adding that several British executives from Boots have already been given high-profile jobs by Walgreens. He said: ‘I strongly believe that the merger will bring significant growth opportunities for both mature and emerging markets. ‘Today’s announcement reflects the great track record and accomplishments of our people to date and I am convinced that their skills, expertise and commitment will continue to make a positive contribution.’ The sale will mean the US retailer owns more than 11,000 shops in 12 countries, as well as the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution network in the world. Walgreens’ American boss, Greg Wasson, will run the new company as president and chief executive. Like Boots, Walgreens began as a single pharmacy. It was opened in 1901 by Charles R Walgreen Snr, and by 1919 had expanded to 20 stores selling food and drink as well as medicines. Much of its early success stemmed from selling whiskey on prescription during the prohibition era. Walgreens has come under fire for continuing to stock tobacco products alongside medicines, but the company claims this means it is more readily able to offer customers advice and products to help them quit smoking. When the deal was in its early stages, some suggested that Walgreens planned to move its headquarters from the US to Britain in order to save on corporation tax. But the firm has said this is not the case, and it will remain based at its current site in Chicago. Boots’ head office will stay in Nottingham, where the business was founded in 1849 by farm worker John Boot, a Methodist who felt strongly about the need to make medicines available to the poor. When he died in 1860 aged 45, his wife Mary and son Jesse took over the chain. By 1890, it had grown to more than 200 stores. ... but it could mean less queueing and cheaper medicines. By RUTH SUNDERLAND, Associate City Editor. Long queues to pick up a prescription at Boots could be a thing of the past after the chemist’s merger with Walgreens. The American giant, which has more than 8,000 outlets across the US, is more advanced when it comes to the technology it uses to run its pharmacy counters. Thanks to the superior systems, waiting times are usually shorter and pharmacists do not need to spend as much time rummaging around on the shelves behind the counter to find medicines. End of this headache? Customers wait to be served in a boots branch at Heathrow Airport, London. Boots in the UK could also copy Walgreens’ pharmacy apps. One allows customers to get a repeat prescription by scanning their medicine’s barcode on a smartphone. They can then pick up their order in just 30 minutes. At flagship Walgreens shops, there is also a no-appointment-needed doctor service, which could be replicated here. The US pharmacies offer many more vaccinations, including those for travellers going to exotic locations. If Boots began offering these services, it would save British customers the inconvenience of a trip to the doctor’s surgery for a jab. In the longer term, Boots’ American deal could lead to cheaper drugs, thanks to a separate partnership it has forged with a US wholesaler called AmerisourceBergen. After the Boots-Walgreens merger they will be able to hand in medicine orders together, putting them in a very strong position to achieve the lowest prices. Combined, the pair will be the biggest purchaser of non-patent drugs on the planet. And the traffic is not all one way. While Boots is a mid-market staple of the British shopping scene, pharmacies in the US are an entirely different matter. ‘Drugstores’ are typically cheap and cheerful bazaars where toiletries and vitamin pills nestle next to cheap electronic goods, lurid cuddly toys and even fridges full of beer. When it comes to cosmetics, drugstores offer budget brands, usually with no testers or ladies in white coats to advise. Women wanting a more upmarket experience have to head for the glitzy department stores and pay top dollar for designer lotions and potions. But Boots is set to bring a slice of the British high street to Walgreens, launching wider ranges of its well-known brands including No7 and Botanics in US stores, and recruiting in-house beauty advisers. It will sell well-loved products such as No7 lipsticks to US women, and remodel Walgreens stores along British lines. Finally, UK customers will be relieved to learn that the Advantage loyalty card will not be affected by the merger, and that the familiar ‘three for two’ offers on Boots products will continue as normal.","output":"Boots is a popular store that started in Nottingham in 1849 as a small herbalist shop. Over time, it became very famous in the UK. Now, it is being sold to a big American company called Walgreens for £6 billion. Walgreens already owns about half of Boots. By buying the rest, they will become the only owner. This happened before with other popular brands like Asda (sold to Walmart) and Cadbury (sold to Kraft). The man in charge of Boots, Stefano Pessina, will make £1.5 billion from this deal. Boots and Walgreens have worked together in the past, like selling Boots' anti-ageing creams in America through Walgreens. Now, we might see more American things in Boots stores in the UK, and maybe even some health screening stations to check things like blood sugar or cholesterol. Walgreens wants to save some money, so they plan to cut costs by £594 million by 2017. It is not clear how this will affect the people who work at Boots and their 2,500 stores. Walgreens started just like Boots, as a small pharmacy in 1901. Today, after buying Boots, they will own over 11,000 shops in 12 countries and have the biggest network for distributing medicine. Boots might get some good things from this deal too. Walgreens has better technology for serving customers at the pharmacy counter, which means shorter waiting times. They also have some cool apps for getting prescriptions and doctor services without appointments. These could be introduced to Boots."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Why did Meade lose his civil rights? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - politicians stripped him of his civil rights. - he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier. - not enough information - he became a convicted felon.

In a new release Thursday, WikiLeaks announced what it's calling \\"The Detainee Policies,\\" a collection of more than a hundred once-secret files outlining America's military detainee practices from Guantanamo to Iraq since 2002. WikiLeaks says it plans to release the files in chronological order to paint a picture of the evolution of America's military detainee practices since September 11th in prisons from Guantanamo to Iraq to Europe. Unlike other recent releases, with the Detainee Policies WikiLeaks seems to be focusing on history more than news: Its first release is the 2002 Guantanamo Camp Delta standard operating procedure manual, a kind of prequel to the 2003 and 2004 manuals from camp it's already published in past years. Other documents in the collection, WikiLeaks says, will show American attempts to \\"disappear\\" detainees by delaying the process of entering them into the detainment system's records, or detail psychological torture methods. \\"[The document collection] shows the excesses of the early days of war against an unknown 'enemy' and how these policies matured and evolved, ultimately deriving into the permanent state of exception that the United States now finds itself in, a decade later,\\" Assange writes in a statement to the press. \\"We call upon lawyers, NGOs, human rights activists and the public to mine the 'Detainee Policies' and investigate important issues...to help us better understand the evolution in these policies and why they have occurred.\\" WikiLeaks' latest publication breaks with its two previous releases of 2012 from the private intelligence firm Stratfor and the Syrian government, both of which consisted of millions of hacked emails rather than a small collection of leaked documents. Just how WikiLeaks obtained the new documents isn't clear--its anonymous submission system has been down for more than two years, with no new conduit for secure document leaks in sight. Lately even members of Anonymous, the hacker group that has long supported WikiLeaks and took credit for supplying the Syria and Stratfor leaks, publicly broke with the group after it created a donation-based paywall around its content. With the Detainee Policies, however, WikiLeaks seems to have removed that pop-up fundraising page. Guantanamo and the fate of its non-citizen detainees has been a recurring theme for WikiLeaks, beginning with its leak in 2007 of the 2003 operating manual for the camp through its 2011 release of 759 Guantanamo detainees' secret files. With WikiLeaks' founder now cooped up in London's Ecuadorean embassy and facing potential criminal charges in the United States, the subject may weigh on Assange's mind more than ever.

The latest release by the anti-secrecy site comes as Assange, who faces charges of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, remains holed up in the Ecuadoran embassy in London with what Quito says are health problems. Assange said in a statement that the newly released documents exposed military detention policies at camps in Iraq and at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Among the documents is the 2002 manual for staff at Camp Delta at Guantanamo, shortly after it was set up by US President George W. Bush to house alleged Al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees from the \\"war on terror\\". \\"This document is of significant historical importance. Guantanamo Bay has become the symbol for systematised human rights abuse in the West with good reason,\\" said Assange, the founder of the website. He added: \\"'The 'Detainee Policies' show the anatomy of the beast that is post-9/11 detention, the carving out of a dark space where law and rights do not apply, where persons can be detained without a trace at the convenience of the US Department of Defense. \\"It shows the excesses of the early days of war against an unknown 'enemy' and how these policies matured and evolved, ultimately deriving into the permanent state of exception that the United States now finds itself in, a decade later.\\" US President Barack Obama vowed within hours of taking office in January 2009 that he would close Guantanamo Bay, saying it was acting as a recruiting tool for Islamist extremists. But Obama has so far failed to do so in the face of deep opposition in Congress to moving inmates to the US mainland, and several people accused of involvement in the 9/11 plots are on trial at the camp. WikiLeaks first enraged Washington in 2010 by publishing a flood of secret military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as a huge cache of diplomatic cables from US embassies across the world. Assange, 41, walked into the Ecuadoran embassy in London on June 19 seeking asylum in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces questioning over alleged rape and sexual assault. He was granted asylum on August 16 but Britain has refused to grant him safe passage out of the country, and he remains in the embassy. Ecuador said on Wednesday it has requested a meeting with Britain to discuss the health of Assange, who it says is losing weight and suffering vision problems. Copyright © 2012 AFP.

One of its more notable releases is called \\"The Detainee Policies,\\" which comprises over a hundred once-secret files outlining America's military detainee practices from Guantanamo to Iraq since 2002. The files reveal the evolution of the U.S. military's detainee practices in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, shining a light on the treatment of detainees and the conditions they faced in various detention facilities. These documents exposed the darker side of the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which has been a symbol of human rights abuse in the Western world. The disclosure of Camp Delta's standard operating procedure manual from 2002, psychological torture methods, and attempts to \\"disappear\\" detainees by delaying their entry into the detainment system's records were some of the primary focuses in this collection of leaked files. Julian Assange's intention behind releasing these files is to uncover important issues related to the detainee policies, understanding their development, and scrutinizing the reasons behind their existence. He calls upon lawyers, NGOs, human rights activists, and the public to utilize these documents to investigate and raise awareness about the injustices faced by detainees in these facilities. WikiLeaks obtained these documents from an unknown source, as its anonymous submission system has been down for more than two years.

It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home.

Step 1: Analyze the context - Ash had been dumped earlier that day, which suggests she was experiencing emotional distress. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers - a) Cry at the table - This answer focuses on Ash's emotional state but does not address her need for sustenance. b) Still have dinner - This answer addresses Ash's need for sustenance and acknowledges her emotional state by eating alone. c) Starve herself - This answer assumes Ash's emotional state would lead her to not eat at all, but the context states she ate dinner. Justification: Although Ash was upset after being dumped, she still recognized the need to eat and take care of herself. Eating dinner alone allowed her to have the necessary sustenance while also providing space to process her emotions."},{"instruction":"This article: Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

Solve 11*x = 51*x - 3*x - 3*x for x.","output":"The first step in solving the equation is to simplify the equation if it can be. We can simplify the equation 11*x = 51*x - 3*x - 3*x. The right side of the equation contains common terms, which are \\"3*x\\" and \\"3*x\\". We can add these two together: 11*x = 51*x - 6*x Now, simplify it further by subtracting 51x and 6x: 11*x = 45*x That's the simplified version of the problem. Now we can continue the solving process. To solve the equation for 'x', we usually get 'x' on one side of the equation by performing the same operation (either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on both sides of the equation. To achieve this, I will use subtraction operation to get rid of one of the 'x's. I'll subtract 45x from both sides of the equation: 11*x - 45*x = 45*x - 45*x That simplifies to: -34*x = 0 Now to isolate x, we will perform division. We will divide both sides of the equation by -34: x = 0 / -34 So, x equals 0.

Options: (A) 9 sec (B) 6 sec (C) 8 sec (D) 10 sec (E) 11 sec Stream of consciousness:","output":"To find the time it takes for the train to pass the telegraph post, we need to determine the distance it needs to travel (its length) and its speed. We are given the train's length (60m) and its speed (36 km/h). Let's break down the steps to solve this problem: Step 1: Convert the train's speed from km/h to m/s. We know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. So, 36 km/h * (1000 meters / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 36 * (1000/3600) m/s = 10 m/s Step 2: Determine the distance the train needs to travel to pass the telegraph post. The train needs to travel its entire length, which is 60 meters.

Opening a minimum wage debate Wednesday, he said that if “Americans are searching for an answer” to why Republicans “would refuse to raise the minimum wage, they should look no further than Republicans’ billionaire benefactors — I repeat, billionaire benefactors — the Koch brothers.” After Republicans blocked a minimum wage increase with a filibuster, Reid went to the Senate TV gallery and complained that “Republicans are defending . . . the Koch brothers, while they come to the floor and oppose raising the minimum wage.” A reporter asked a question about a proposed constitutional amendment that would limit campaign contributions. Reid answered with a non sequitur: “The Koch brothers, of course, have — they scored this vote,” he said. “In effect what they did is say, ‘If you vote yes, we’re not going to be with you anymore.’ ” I caught up with Reid in the hall outside and asked whether he was concerned that all these Koch mentions were turning him into a Koch addict. “I tried that line; nobody picked it up,” he said. “I said they were Koch addicts.” He did, on March 4: “Senate Republicans are addicted to Koch.” But somebody picked it up: The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative Web site, included it in a montage it made this month of the 134 times Reid uttered the Koch name, nearly all since he first tried a Koch line on Feb. 26. These include: “Koch dollars,” “Koch money,” “Koch ads,” “Kochs’ immorality,” “Koch brothers’ radical philosophy,” “Koch brothers’ lies,” “Koch-Ryan budget” and “I’m not afraid of the Koch brothers.” Reid also described the Kochs as Las Vegas illusionists and “power-drunk billionaires.” Reid went too far when he suggested that the Kochs’ attempt to “buy America” made them “about as un-American as anyone I can imagine.” That is factually incorrect. The Roberts Supreme Court has made it downright patriotic to buy elections. The senator recognizes that in modern politics it works to demonize the enemy — and as ultra-secretive oil tycoons, the Kochs come from bogeyman central casting. Conservatives did the same thing — and worse — to liberal billionaire George Soros, who endured attacks by Glenn Beck in 2010 that had anti-Semitic overtones. Tom DeLay, Nancy Pelosi, Karl Rove and Reid himself, among many others, have served as demons. Some Democrats have joined Reid in his Koch campaign, but a search of the Congressional Record finds that of the 74 occasions on which the Kochs have come up during this Congress, Reid was responsible for 29 of them. In Wednesday’s Senate debate, Reid found a way to blame the Kochs for the Republicans’ opposition to the minimum-wage increase. “Absolutely no one was surprised yesterday when Americans for Prosperity, which is only one of the Koch-funded political organizations, instructed Republicans in Congress to vote against a minimum-wage increase,” he said. “If you vote yes, you’re not going to get the help of Charlie and Dave.” Reid went on to contend that “the will of the Koch brothers seems to be the top priority for my Republican colleagues” and that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) “will need to check with the Koch brothers first” before drafting legislation. After Democrats fell six votes short of breaking the filibuster, Reid told reporters that “six Republicans have rushed to defend Dave and Charlie, the Koch brothers. . . . If the same number of Republicans voted with us, we would have minimum wage.” An aide said Reid was referring to public remarks by six Republican senators defending the Kochs. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) called the pair “the left’s latest bizarre obsession,” while David Vitter (La.) proclaimed “God bless the Koch brothers” and Ted Cruz (Tex.) spoke of the “impropriety” of Reid trying to turn “two private citizens” into “characters almost out of Dr. Seuss.” The Louisiana Republican Party filed an ethics complaint against Reid, saying he used his government-funded Web site to attack the brothers. Good luck with that. An ethics complaint is weak medicine for an advanced Koch dependency. Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

Cellular respiration consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and the electron transport chain. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, releasing a small amount of energy in the form of ATP and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The pyruvate molecules are then transported into the mitochondria of the cell, where they undergo the citric acid cycle and are broken down into carbon dioxide, yielding more ATP, NADH, and another energy carrier, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). The NADH and FADH2 produced in the previous stages supply electrons to the electron transport chain, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As the electrons pass through a series of protein complexes and other molecules, they release energy that is used to pump hydrogen ions across the membrane, generating an electrochemical gradient. This gradient drives the synthesis of the majority of the cell's ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. Oxygen, which was released by the heme within small capillaries and diffused into the cells, serves as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, forming water as a byproduct of the reaction. The ATP produced during cellular respiration is then used by the cells to power various cellular activities, such as muscle contraction, signal transmission between neurons, active transport of ions and molecules across cell membranes, and synthesis of new macromolecules like proteins and nucleic acids. In summary, the final step of the process described is the utilization of the released oxygen in cellular respiration to produce energy in the form of ATP, which is then employed by the cells for carrying out a wide range of biological functions and maintaining homeostasis in the body."},{"instruction":"Options are: (i). negative; (ii). positive; What would be an example of an (ii). review?","output":"Imagine you went to a park and had a great time.

Answer:","output":"Alkalinity is a key parameter in assessing the buffering capacity of an aqueous solution, specifically its ability to neutralize acids and resist changes in pH. In the context of a stream's ability to counteract acidic pollution such as acid rain or other forms of acidic precipitation, alkalinity plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems. Acid rain or acidic precipitation is characterized by its unusually high concentrations of hydrogen ions (H+), which lower the pH of the water. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being considered neutral. Acidic substances have a pH less than 7, while alkaline substances have a pH greater than 7. Acid rain typically has a pH between 4.2 and 4.4, but can be as low as 2 in some cases. When assessing a stream's ability to neutralize acidic pollution, measuring alkalinity helps determine the degree to which the stream can buffer and maintain a stable pH. Alkalinity in water primarily comes from the presence of carbonate ions (CO3 2-), bicarbonate ions (HCO3 -), and hydroxide ions (OH-). These ions react with hydrogen ions, effectively neutralizing the acid and preventing drastic pH changes. A higher alkalinity indicates a greater buffering capacity to withstand acidic input. Healthy freshwater ecosystems usually have a pH between 6.5 and 8.5, which provides optimal living conditions for most aquatic organisms. Therefore, when measuring the alkalinity of a stream that can effectively neutralize acidic pollution from acid rain or other acidic precipitation, one would expect to see a pH value within this range. However, it is important to note that the specific pH requirement may vary depending on the particular species inhabiting the water. In summary, alkalinity represents the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution, such as a stream, to neutralize acid and is essential in determining the stream's ability to cope with acidic pollution, such as acid rain or other forms of acidic precipitation. Ideal alkalinity would maintain the pH of the stream within the range of 6.5 to 8.5, which supports the health of most freshwater ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Article: Research has shown that 85 percent of communication is nonverbal, so choosing what to wear to an interview is clearly an important part of your overall presentation.

How to treat hepatitis a Get lots of rest. Symptoms of hepatitis a are often described as flu-like and include fatigue (tiredness), weakness, loss of appetite and a low-grade fever. To combat these symptoms, get plenty of rest, especially during the initial stages of the infection, and temporarily reduce your activities and exercise regiment.","output":"Continuing from the initial advice on treating Hepatitis A, the most logical next event would involve incorporating further measures to manage and alleviate symptoms while ensuring that the patient recovers effectively. It is crucial to adopt a comprehensive treatment plan that covers different aspects of physical wellbeing, mental health, and lifestyle changes. The following steps can be implemented: 1. Maintain hydration: Hepatitis A can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration. Make sure to drink plenty of water and consume fluids containing electrolytes like coconut water or sports drinks. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages, as these can further dehydrate the body and exacerbate liver damage. 2. Consume a nourishing diet: A well-balanced diet is essential to support recovery and meet the body's nutritional demands. Make sure to eat meals rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, and include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources. Limit the intake of fatty or processed foods to reduce stress on the liver and decrease inflammation. 3. Medication management: Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen can be taken to alleviate fever and minor body aches. However, avoid taking any prescription or non-prescription drugs, supplements, or herbal remedies without consulting a healthcare professional. Some medications can harm the liver and impede recovery. 4. Medical follow-up: Regular check-ups with a healthcare professional throughout the course of the infection are essential to monitor progress, address any complications, and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Blood tests are often conducted to evaluate liver function and ensure that recovery is progressing well. 5. Practice good hygienic habits: Hepatitis A spreads through the fecal-oral route, so it is essential to practice good hygiene to prevent transmission to others. Wash hands thoroughly and frequently, especially after using the restroom, before preparing or eating food, and after changing diapers. Additionally, disinfect any contaminated surfaces such as toilet seats, handles, and faucet knobs. 6. Emotional support: Recovering from Hepatitis A can be physically and mentally draining. Enlisting the support of family, friends, or mental health professionals can help cope with anxiety, stress, or depression during the recovery process. 7. Preventing reinfection and spreading: To prevent reinfection or spreading the virus to others, avoid sharing personal items like toothbrushes, towels, and eating utensils. Also, practicing safe food handling techniques can reduce the risk of transmission. 8. Vaccination and post-infection immunity: Once a person has recovered from Hepatitis A, they usually develop lifelong immunity against the virus. However, it's essential to recognize that immunity to Hepatitis A does not grant protection against other hepatitis viruses like B and C.

Context: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: Why was Patch hungry?

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room.

It describes the epidemic of tobacco use among youth ages 12 through 17 and young adults ages 18 through 25, including the epidemiology, causes, and health effects of this tobacco use and interventions proven to prevent it. Scientific evidence contained in this report supports the following facts: We have made progress in reducing tobacco use among youth; however, far too many young people are still using tobacco. Today, more than 600,000 middle school students and 3 million high school students smoke cigarettes. Rates of decline for cigarette smoking have slowed in the last decade and rates of decline for smokeless tobacco use have stalled completely. Every day, more than 1,200 people in this country die due to smoking. For each of those deaths, at least two youth or young adults become regular smokers each day. Almost 90% of those replacement smokers smoke their first cigarette by age 18. There could be 3 million fewer young smokers today if success in reducing youth tobacco use that was made between 1997 and 2003 had been sustained. Rates of smokeless tobacco use are no longer declining, and they appear to be increasing among some groups. Cigars, especially cigarette-sized cigars, are popular with youth. One out of five high school males smokes cigars, and cigar use appears to be increasing among other groups. Use of multiple tobacco products—including cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco—is common among young people. Prevention efforts must focus on young adults ages 18 through 25, too. Almost no one starts smoking after age 25. Nearly 9 out of 10 smokers started smoking by age 18, and 99% started by age 26. Progression from occasional to daily smoking almost always occurs by age 26. Tobacco use by youth and young adults causes both immediate and long-term damage. One of the most serious health effects is nicotine addiction, which prolongs tobacco use and can lead to severe health consequences. The younger youth are when they start using tobacco, the more likely they’ll be addicted. Early cardiovascular damage is seen in most young smokers; those most sensitive die very young. Smoking reduces lung function and retards lung growth. Teens who smoke are not only short of breath today, they may end up as adults with lungs that will never grow to full capacity. Such damage is permanent and increases the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Youth are sensitive to nicotine and can feel dependent earlier than adults. Because of nicotine addiction, about three out of four teen smokers end up smoking into adulthood, even if they intend to quit after a few years. Among youth who persist in smoking, a third will die prematurely from smoking. Youth are vulnerable to social and environmental influences to use tobacco; messages and images that make tobacco use appealing to them are everywhere. Young people want to fit in with their peers. Images in tobacco marketing make tobacco use look appealing to this age group. Youth and young adults see smoking in their social circles, movies they watch, video games they play, websites they visit, and many communities where they live. Smoking is often portrayed as a social norm, and young people exposed to these images are more likely to smoke. Youth identify with peers they see as social leaders and may imitate their behavior; those whose friends or siblings smoke are more likely to smoke. Youth who are exposed to images of smoking in movies are more likely to smoke. Those who get the most exposure to onscreen smoking are about twice as likely to begin smoking as those who get the least exposure. Images of smoking in movies have declined over the past decade; however, in 2010 nearly a third of top-grossing movies produced for children—those with ratings of G, PG, or PG-13— contained images of smoking. Tobacco companies spend more than a million dollars an hour in this country alone to market their products. This report concludes that tobacco product advertising and promotions still entice far too many young people to start using tobacco. The tobacco industry has stated that its marketing only promotes brand choices among adult smokers. Regardless of intent, this marketing encourages underage youth to smoke. Nearly 9 out of 10 smokers start smoking by age 18, and more than 80% of underage smokers choose brands from among the top three most heavily advertised. The more young people are exposed to cigarette advertising and promotional activities, the more likely they are to smoke. The report finds that extensive use of price-reducing promotions has led to higher rates of tobacco use among young people than would have occurred in the absence of these promotions. Many tobacco products on the market appeal to youth. Some cigarette-sized cigars contain candy and fruit flavoring, such as strawberry and grape. Many of the newest smokeless tobacco products do not require users to spit, and others dissolve like mints; these products include snus—a spitless, dry snuff packaged in a small teabag-like sachet—and dissolvable strips and lozenges. Young people find these products appealing in part because they can be used without detection at school or other places where smoking is banned. However, these products cause and sustain nicotine addiction, and most youth who use them also smoke cigarettes. Through the use of advertising and promotional activities, packaging, and product design, the tobacco industry encourages the myth that smoking makes you thin. This message is especially appealing to young girls. It is not true—teen smokers are not thinner than nonsmokers. Comprehensive, sustained, multi-component programs can cut youth tobacco use in half in 6 years. ||||| He may have a licence to kill, but it turns out James Bond is becoming increasingly aware of risks to his health. Renowned for his shaken (not stirred) martinis, fictional spy James Bond has long been seen as quite attached to his cigarettes - shown smoking in bed, while driving and once even while flying a hang glider. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Sean Connery as James Bond with a cigarette in hand in Diamonds Are Forever (1971). Photo: United Artists Corporation But new analysis of all 24 films has found that 007 has kicked the habit for 15 years now, with his final smoke in 2002 in Die Another Day. The study, published on Tuesday in international journal Tobacco Control, has shown the films are still riddled by images of smoking, with only one film in the 55-year franchise smoke-free - Casino Royale (2006). SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The latest film in the franchise Spectre (2015) did not feature smoking by any major associate of Bond. Photo: Stephen Vaughan As the longest-running and highest-grossing global movie franchise, researchers have previously been concerned by the impact of Bond's lifestyle habits on audiences, with studies focusing on his alcohol consumption and violence. The new study, conducted by the Department of Public Health at the University of Otago, marked the first analysis of 007's smoking habits since the films began in 1962. Advertisement The study found Bond's on-screen smoking peaked in the 1960s, when he lit up for 83 per cent of screen time. On average, 007 reached for a cigarette within the first 20 minutes of each film. But over the past few decades his smoking habits have decreased, as he became smoke-free during the 1990s and stopped in 2002. Since 1967, references to dangers of smoking have increased, beginning with one villain's quip: \\"It won't be the nicotine that kills you Mr Bond\\". Mr Bond also seems to have outgrown the \\"smoking-related spy gadgetry\\" which featured in four out of five films of the 1970s, including guns disguised as cigarettes, stun gas-releasing cigarettes and radio-transmitting lighters. However, the researchers are concerned that images of smoking remain prevalent in the films, given \\"links between smoking in movies and teens taking it up\\". According the study's authors, Professor Nick Wilson and Anne Tucker, the spy is still subject to secondhand smoke from Bond girls and villains, the latest example his love interest Sévérine in Skyfall (2012). Its successor Spectre (2015) did not portray any smoking by Bond's \\"major associates\\", but did show other characters smoking indoors. \\"While there are some favourable downward smoking-related trends in this movie series, the persisting smoking content remains problematic from a public health perspective, especially given the popularity of this movie series,\\" the authors wrote. \\"One estimate for [Spectre] indicates 261 million 'tobacco impressions' for the 10 to 29-year age-group in the USA alone.\\" Bond is still likely to die another day: the study also noted that the risks to Bond from his lovers' smoking was likely reduced due to \\"the typically brief nature of his relationships\\" and their \\"typically... short lives with a cumulative mortality from violence\\". ||||| Bond himself no longer smokes, but is still exposed to second-hand smoke Smoking related imagery is conspicuous by its absence from only one Bond movie since 007 first graced cinema screens in 1962, finds an analysis in Tobacco Control. And while Bond himself has stubbed out his last cigarette, with no smoking after 2002, he continues to be exposed to second-hand smoke, including from his sexual partners, the findings show. Given the links between smoking in movies and teens taking it up, and that the James Bond series of movies is the longest running and highest ever grossing movie franchise globally, these findings are of concern, say the researchers. While several studies have delved into various aspects of Bond's lifestyle, there hasn't been any detailed consideration of smoking related content and its potential health impact since the spy first lit up in 1962. The researchers therefore analysed these themes in the 24 Bond movies screened by Eon Productions, from 1962 (Dr No) up to the latest, Spectre, in 2015. They found that Bond's on screen smoking peaked during the 1960s, when he puffed away in 83% of the movies produced in that decade, after which it declined until he took his last puff in 2002 (Die Another Day). When he was a smoker, he lit up, on average, within 20 minutes of the start of the film. While smoking has declined among Bond's sexual partners over the decades, it is still happening, as seen most recently in 2012 in Skyfall. Smoking by his sexual partners would have exposed Bond to considerable levels of second- hand cigarette smoke, although the typically brief nature of his romantic liaisons would have at least curbed some of the impact, suggest the researchers. Smoking related spy gadgetry had a relatively short lifespan in Bond movies, peaking in the 1970s in 80% of the films produced during that decade, but never to be seen again after 1989. And cigarette branding featured in two movies: in 1979 (Marlboro in Moonraker); and in 1989 (Lark in License to Kill), as part of a product placement deal with Philip Morris to open up the Japanese cigarette market. Overall, smoking related imagery was absent in only one movie in 2006 (Casino Royale). In the most recent movie, in 2015, none of Bond's major associates smoked, but other characters still did, adding up to an estimated 261 million 'tobacco impressions' for 10-29 year olds in the USA alone. The researchers note that there have been attempts in the Bond series to mention/depict the hazards of smoking, the first of which came in 1967 (You Only Live Twice), with subsequent references made in 1974, 1979, 1997. And in 1999, Miss Moneypenny hurls Bond's gift to her of a cigar into the bin in disgust (The World Is Not Enough). But while there have been some \\"favourable downward smoking related trends in this movie series, the persisting smoking content remains problematic from a public health perspective, especially given the popularity of the series,\\" write the researchers. And they suggest that while smoking seems to be at odds with Bond's need for physical fitness and his level of educational attainment, it does fit with his disregard for other risks to his health. After all, 007 has dodged thousands of bullets, he drinks a lot of alcohol, and often drives very fast, they point out. And that's without a goodly proportion of his sexual partners (nine out of 60) attempting to disable, capture, or kill him..... # Commentary: Die Another Day, James Bond's smoking over six decades http://tobaccocontrol. bmj. com/ content/ early/ 2017/ 01/ 04/ tobaccocontrol-2016-053426. short?g= w_tobaccocontrol_ahead_tab About the journal: ||||| Write a summary.","output":"James Bond, the fictional British spy, has not smoked since 2002, according to research in medical journal, Tobacco Control.

In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in the New Mexico desert are attacked by Letch. A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the United States Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and Amber (Jessica Stroup). The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group Amber is attacked by Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and the sergeant is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others attempt to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen they are forced to try to find another way down. The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves.

Do you have assignments left to be submitted, or only the final exam? Make a list of all the classes you currently have, what needs to be done for each class, and the due dates for all assignments and exams. In order to get the “big picture,” use a calendar to mark out all your assignment due dates and exam dates. Sit down and think about how you’ve been studying up until this point. Analyze what has worked and what hasn’t - then ask yourself why. Make a list of things you want to avoid doing in the future (e.g., procrastination) - and don’t do them. Figure out what your motivations for studying are and take advantage of them. This is a good opportunity to learn how to do a S.W.O.T. (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats) analysis. The SWOT analysis method was designed for businesses, but can easily be adapted to your personal academic situation. Ask your teacher(s) for advice on how you can improve, and where you might have gone wrong. Keep in mind that this conversation could go one of several ways. If you’ve been a lazy student up until this point, and you’re now asking for help, some teachers are not going to be impressed. Make sure you approach them sincerely and then actually follow through on their advice. If you ask for their help and then don’t follow it, they’re probably not going to be too thrilled to help you again in the future. Ask your teacher if there are any assignments you can do for extra credit. Ask your teacher if you can hand-in any outstanding assignments, even those past the deadline. Or if you can re-do any assignments you did badly on. Ask for help as soon as you know you're having trouble. Do not wait until the last minute to ask for help, or to ask for things such as extra credit. In most cases it will be too late for you. Your parents don’t want you to get bad grades, and if you admit you’re having problems, they will likely want to help. Even if all you need them to do is constantly follow-up with you to make sure you’re doing your work, asking for help is a good idea. Keep in mind that showing this initiative to your parents may help them provide additional support to you in the future. For example, if they see you’re having a lot of trouble with math, they may be able to hire a math tutor to work with you the next semester or during the summer. Look through your calendar of things you still have to do and make a detailed schedule. Assign specific study goals to yourself everyday, and the times each day that you’ll spend on studying. Try not to schedule large amounts of time for one topic unless absolutely necessary. Try to study more than one topic per day if possible. Remember that smaller chunks of daily study time are more effective than a huge cram session or two. If you're in college, you should plan to study 2-3 hours per week for each credit hour you're enrolled. So, if you're in a 3-hour history class, you should plan on studying an additional 6-9 hours per week for that class. If that sounds like a lot, that's because it is -- and it's what it usually takes to get good grades. Don’t forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals. These rewards just need to be small things to keep you motivated to move forward day-by-day - such as allowing yourself an hour to watch your favourite TV show, or an hour to play a video game. Save the big rewards for when the semester is done! While not the best advice, if you are down to the wire, cram. Stuff in as much as you can, in whatever time you have left. Drink lots of caffeinated beverages. Forego (some) sleep. Consider this your “hail mary” play and do the best you can. Avoid getting distracted during cram sessions. Turn off your phone and the TV. Don't listen to music with lyrics. You have very limited time, so use it wisely. This is, of course, assuming this wasn’t the last semester of school you’re ever going to take! If school is not over, take this opportunity to get yourself ready for the next year or semester. Buy yourself an academic calendar or organizer. Review your course syllabi before classes begin. Make sure you have all the materials you need for each course before the start of the semester, if possible. Organize your study space. Research the various ways of getting academic support on your campus (i.e. success centres, writing centres, tutors, etc.). No one likes going to class in the summer, but if you’re looking to improve your grades this is definitely an option. You may want to consider re-taking a class over the summer (to increase your grade) or taking a supplemental class to help you prepare for a hard class you have coming up. At the post-secondary level there are additional benefits to taking one or more classes in the summer term: you can reduce your workload in the fall and winter terms, or reduce the total amount of time you spend in college; some summer programs are offered in other countries or at other colleges, giving you a chance to travel; if you’re aiming to take a specific course with a prerequisite, you can get the pre-req out of the way early.","output":"In summary, improving your grades in one or multiple classes requires a strategic and organized approach. Firstly, create a list of all your classes, assignments, and exams along with their respective due dates. Utilize a calendar to get an overview of your academic schedule. Reflect on your previous study habits and consider what was effective and what was not. Identify areas of improvement and avoid making the same mistakes in the future. Consider performing a SWOT analysis to identify your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in your academic journey. Seek advice from your teachers and inquire about extra credit opportunities or the possibility of submitting late or revised assignments. Remember to approach them sincerely and follow through on their recommendations. Engage your parents or guardians for support when needed and show initiative in managing your academic responsibilities. Create a detailed study schedule and assign specific goals for each day, dividing study time into smaller, manageable portions. Allocate 2-3 hours of study time per week for each credit hour you're enrolled in. Reward yourself for reaching milestones and stay motivated. In dire situations, resort to cramming while avoiding distractions. However, this should be the last resort. Make an effort to better prepare yourself for upcoming semesters by obtaining an academic calendar, reviewing course syllabi, and organizing your study space. Also, explore academic support resources available on your campus. Lastly, consider taking summer classes to improve your grades or better prepare for future courses. Summer courses can help reduce workload during regular semesters, give you an opportunity to travel, or assist in fulfilling prerequisite requirements. Adopting these strategies and seeking support from teachers, parents, and support centers, will contribute to achieving better grades and a healthier academic record."},{"instruction":"Gang of bikers attack driver in front of family after high-speed chase An unidentified 30-year-old man was attacked in front of his wife in child in New York City after his vehicle was pursued by a gang of motorcyclists in a high speed chase. It is not clear what started the altercation, but a video apparently taken by one of the bikers shows the gang surrounding the man’s Range Rover SUV on Manhattan’s West Side Highway Monday afternoon, the New York Post reports. In the video, at least one biker is seen slowing down and parking his bike in front of the man’s vehicle, causing him to stop. Another biker began walking threateningly toward the vehicle before the driver gunned it and smashed into several bikes and riders. The group then pursued the driver at high speeds until he got caught in traffic. At that point, another biker tried to rip open the SUV’s door, but the driver sped off again. The chase came to an end in the upper Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights when the driver was caught in traffic a second time. One biker in the video is shown ripping off his helmet and using it to smash the driver-side window of the SUV. Police sources told the New York Post that the man was slashed in front of his wife and child, who were inside the vehicle. The man was brought to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital to get stitches.

Such keywords can be directly from the given abstract or outside it. Q: Abstract: The objective of this study was to find naturally occurring anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies to anti-human thyroglobulin (anti-hTg) idiotype in sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sera from normal subjects were tested for the presence of anti-Id antibodies against mouse anti-hTg monoclonal antibodies (McAb) in indirect ELISA and in indirect solid-phase RIA. Microtitration plates were coated with six McAb, five of them directed against different epitopes on hTg molecule, and then incubated with patients' sera. The bound antibody was detected with either peroxidase or 125I-labeled anti-human IgG. The specific positive reaction was observed in four of 40 patients with HT, in two of 26 patients with GD, in seven of 58 patients with RA, and in none of 20 normal subjects. The detected binding was due to the presence of anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies and not to Tg-anti-Tg circulating immune complexes, as the positive sera did not contain hTg when resolved on SDS-PAGE, nor did they bind to all anti-hTg McAb tested. The binding was dose dependent, and titers of anti-Id antibodies varied from 1:243 to 1:2187. The binding could be inhibited up to 50% by hTg, but not by the thyroid microsomal antigen, indicating that some of those anti-Id might represent the internal image of the antigen. Serum from the patient 3403, showing the strongest reactivity against McAb A-3, was chosen for IgG purification and F(ab')2 fragment isolation. The 3403 F(ab')2 fragment, but not the Fc fragment, was found to react specifically with four mouse anti-hTg McAb but not with the control mouse IgG. Thus, the obtained results permit the conclusion that anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies could occur naturally during the course of thyroid autoimmune disorders. A:","output":"anti-idiotypic antibodies in autoimmune thyroid disease To come up with this answer, I identified the main focus of the study from the abstract, which was to find \\"anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies to anti-human thyroglobulin (anti-hTg) idiotype in sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.\\" This phrase captures the key element of the research and its contribution to the understanding of autoimmune thyroid disease."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Find the phone number: Before dialing, make sure you have the phone number of the person or business you wish to call. The number should consist of an area code (if required) and the local number. 2. Prepare the rotary phone: Place the rotary phone on a flat surface, like a table or desk, and ensure that the phone line is connected to the wall. 3. Pick up the handset: Lift the handset off the phone, and hold it to your ear. You should hear a dial tone. This signifies that the phone line is active and ready for you to dial the number. 4. Dial the area code (if required): If you need to include an area code, locate the first digit of the area code on the rotary dial. With your finger in the hole, rotate the dial clockwise until it reaches the metal stopper. Release the dial, allowing it to return to its starting position. Repeat this process for each digit of the area code. Remember to wait for the dial to return to its starting position before moving on to the next digit. 5. Dial the local number: Dial the local number by rotating the dial for each digit, just as you did for the area code. Ensure you wait for the dial to return to its starting position between each digit. 6. Allow the phone to connect: Once you have finished dialing the complete phone number, the telephone network will begin to connect your call. After a few seconds, you should hear ringing on the other end. Wait for the person you are calling to answer the phone. 7. Speak with the person: When the person on the other end picks up, you can begin your conversation. Hold the handset close to your mouth and speak clearly. 8. End the call: Once you finish your conversation, gently place the handset back onto the cradle of the phone. This action disconnects the call and returns the phone to a ready state for the next call. By following these steps, you'll successfully make a call on an old rotary phone while respecting the mechanical process involved in dialing and connecting to the desired phone number."},{"instruction":"Pořádně nechápu, co vlastně je.

Here's how I would make popcorn, step by step, following option A: 1. Gather the necessary ingredients and utensils, including popcorn kernels, oil, a large pan with a lid, and a heatproof spatula. 2. Place the pan on the stovetop, and add an appropriate amount of oil. This may vary depending on the size of the pan, but generally, a thin layer that covers the entire bottom of the pan is sufficient. 3. Turn on the stove to medium heat, allowing the oil to warm up evenly. The proper temperature is important for effective popping. It would be good to also test if the oil is hot enough by dropping one or two kernels; if they pop quickly, the oil is ready. 4. Once the oil reaches the correct temperature, add a single layer of kernels to the pan, ensuring they are evenly distributed in the oil. It is necessary not to overcrowd the pan to prevent some kernels from burning before others have a chance to pop. 5. As soon as the first few kernels begin to pop, quickly place the lid on the pan to avoid any popped corn from flying out of the pan and to keep in the steam that helps the kernels pop. 6. Using a heatproof spatula, occasionally shake the pan gently to move the kernels around, preventing them from burning at the bottom of the pan, promoting even heat distribution, and encouraging more kernels to pop. 7. Keep cooking the kernels until the popping significantly slows down or ceases. At this point, it is safe to assume that most of the kernels have popped. 8. Turn off the heat and, carefully using an oven mitt or heatproof handle if necessary, remove the pan from the stove. Wait for a few seconds for any last few pops, and then slowly lift the lid away from your face to avoid any steam. 9. Pour the popped popcorn into a large bowl and season it to taste with salt, butter, or your preferred spices and enjoy. I choose this option because it is a simple yet effective way of making popcorn, and it allows for more control over the cooking process. This method is also widely used and produces consistent results."},{"instruction":"The Towle WC aka Towle TA-1 was a custom built aircraft for a 1929 round-the world flight.

Devonte Hart and his sister Hannah, 16, have yet to be found since the wreckage was discovered March 26 by a passer-by off Route 1 near Westport, California. The crash killed Jennifer Hart and Sarah Hart, both 38, and their children, Markis Hart, 19; Abigail Hart, 14; Jeremiah Hart, 14; and Sierra Hart, 12. Sierra Hart's legal name is \\"Ciera.\\" Here's a timeline of what we know so far: March 2004: Earliest known public record that shows Jennifer Hart and Sarah Gengler, both from South Dakota, residing in Alexandria, Minnesota. April 2005: The couple is licensed to provide child foster care in Douglas County, Minnesota, for almost two years beginning April 1, 2005. May 2005: Sarah Hart petitions to change her last name from Gengler to Hart. August 2006: A Harris County District Court (Texas) judge orders the parental rights of the biological parents of Devonte, Jeremiah, Sierra and a fourth child terminated. September 2006: Jennifer and Sarah Hart adopt siblings Markis, Abigail and Hannah. December 2006: The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services removes Devonte, Jeremiah, Sierra and a fourth child from the care of an aunt, Priscilla Celestine, after a caseworker visit. The children are then placed in foster care. May 2007: The aunt, Celestine, files a petition to adopt all four children while they are being cared for by the state of Texas. The petition is denied in Harris County District Court the next year. The aunt files a motion for a new trial, and that is denied as well. September 2008: According to a police report from Alexandria, Minnesota, Hannah, then 6, tells authorities that one of her mothers bruised her with a belt. Asked about the beating, Jennifer and Sarah Hart tell a police investigator and social worker the girl had fallen down the stairs. October 2008: Celestine appeals to a Texas appeals court to overturn the adoption petition and new trial dismissals. February 2009: Jennifer and Sarah adopt Devonte and two of his siblings — bringing their number of children to six. An article from Paper Trail, a New Zealand-based news outlet, describes his adoption. The article said by age 4, the boy had been abused, neglected, shot at and had endured other traumas. The fourth child, Dontay Davis, is not adopted by the Harts. July 2010: A Texas appeals court turns down Celestine's attempt to adopt Devonte Hart and three of his siblings, court records show. November 2010: Police in Alexandria, Minnesota interview Abigail Hart, 6 at the time, after a teacher discovers bruises stretching from her sternum to her navel. The girl says Jennifer Hart hit her with a closed fist, put her head in a cold bath, then hit her again, court records show. She was then grounded, the girl told police, which meant she had to stay in bed and miss lunch. April 2011: Sarah Hart pleads guilty to abusing Abigail Hart and is sentenced to a year of probation for misdemeanor domestic assault, court records show. Sarah told police she was the one who hit Abigail, even though the girl told authorities her mother Jennifer had done it. The next day, all six of the Hart children are taken out of public schools. They never attend public school again. October 2011: The family lives in Alexandria, Minnesota, for a time and takes part in local activism. Hart family members including Devonte and Jennifer Hart participate in an Occupy Minneapolis demonstration. 2012: According to friends in Oregon, Sarah Hart travels to Portland to look for work. Jennifer Hart and their children later join her. 2013: After the family moves to West Linn, family friend Alexandra Argyropoulos tells Oregon child welfare officials that the Hart parents have been depriving their kids of food as punishment, she says. The Harts break off contact with her when they learn of it. Argyropoulos says she was told the Hart children had been interviewed by Oregon officials; it was apparent that each child had been coached by their mothers on what to say; and nothing more could be done by the Oregon Department of Human Services. July 2013: The police department responds to a call to the Hart's house. November 2014: Family members participate in a Portland protest of a Missouri grand jury declining to indict a Ferguson police officer in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. Devonte and a Portland police officer hug, and the photo of the moment goes viral. March 2016: Family members join U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont onstage during a presidential campaign rally in Vancouver. May 2017: Jennifer and Sarah Hart buy a two-story, 3-bedroom home on 2 acres of land in the Woodland area of Clark County, Washington, property records show. November 2017: Steve Frkovich, a relative of the Harts' neighbors, tells a dispatcher that he is concerned about the children. He says he feels the kids are \\"being highly abused\\" and recounts Hannah Hart jumping out a window and seeking help. The incident happened a few months prior to his call to authorities, and a neighbor — Frkovich's daughter — says there have been no other issues since that one. March 23, 2018: The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services opens a Child Protective Services investigation in which the Hart children are \\"identified as potential victims of alleged abuse or neglect.\\" March 23, 2018: The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services attempts without success to make contact with the Hart family. March 24, 2018: Sarah Hart sends a 3 a.m. text message to a friend, saying she's so sick she might have to go to the hospital. The friend, Cheryl Hart, never hears from Sarah again. March 24, 2018: The family is in or around Newport, Oregon, around 8:14 a.m., police say. It's believed they continue south on Route 101 until they reach State Route 1 in Leggett, California. March 24, 2018: The Harts travel south on State Route 1 until they reach the Fort Bragg area in Mendocino around 8 p.m.. The family stays there until about 9 p.m. March 25, 2018. March 26, 2018: Cheryl Hart calls a Clark County emergency dispatcher at at 1:15 p.m., asking the Clark County Sheriff's Office to do a welfare check at the family's Woodland, Washington, home. March 26, 2018: The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services again unsuccessfully attempts to make contact with the Hart family. March 26, 2018: A passer-by along Highway 1 in Westport, California, calls 911 after looking down a 100-foot embankment and seeing an SUV upside down on the rocky shoreline. Five people are found dead: three children outside the SUV and two women inside. March 27, 2018: The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services makes a third unsuccessful attempt to contact the Hart family. March 28, 2018: The women are identified by the Mendocino County's Sheriff's Office as Jennifer and Sarah Hart and their children as Markis, Jeremiah and Abigail. Three of their other children: Devonte, Hannah and Sierra, remain missing. Sheriff Tom Allman said a search is ongoing for the remaining three children. March 29, 2018: Police continue to search for the three missing children, including Devonte, and to investigate why the SUV plunged off the California cliff. Authorities don't know if the kids were also in the car, but are basing their search on the assumption that they were thrown from the car into the cliffs or the surf. March 31, 2018: Officials reveal the speedometer on the Harts' wrecked SUV was \\"pinned\\" at 90 mph. April 2, 2018: Officials say the crash may have been intentional, saying data taken from the family's SUV shows the vehicle came to a complete stop at the Route 1 pullout before speeding off the cliff.

The FBI has posted missing person fliers for both children on its website. — The Oregonian/OregonLive ||||| Updated 6:30 p.m. Devonte Hart, a boy who in 2014 was at the center of a viral photo showing his tender embrace with a Portland policeman, is missing and at least five family members are dead after their SUV plunged off a cliff along the Northern California coast. Devonte, now 15, is believed to have been in his family's vehicle as it went off a Pacific Coast Highway cliff Monday, killing his parents and at least three siblings. Authorities continued late Wednesday to scour the crash scene, including the ocean, in search of the children believed to have been in the car, the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office said. The victims, former West Linn residents who had moved to Woodland, Washington, plunged to their deaths when their 2003 GMC veered off Route 1 near the town of Westport and fell 100 feet, eventually landing on its roof on a large rock at the shoreline. The three children killed weren't using seat belts and \\"came out\\" of the vehicle at some point, the California Highway Patrol said. The women were found inside wearing safety restraints. Authorities on Wednesday identified the adults as Jennifer Jean Hart, the driver, and Sarah Margaret Hart, both 38. The Hart children killed were Markis, 19, Abigail, 14, and Jeremiah, 14. The sheriff's office said they can't find siblings Devonte, Hannah, 16, and Sierra, 12. All six kids were adopted by the married couple, the sheriff's office said. The crash occurred days after authorities in Washington tried to visit the family home multiple times after receiving reports of abuse and neglect concerning the children. At a news conference Wednesday, Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman said officials have \\"every indication to believe\\" all six children were in the vehicle when it went off the cliff. \\"We have no evidence and no reason to believe this was an intentional act,\\" Allman said. He also said there are no skid marks or brake marks indicating why the vehicle went off the cliff. He said an investigation is ongoing. The sheriff appealed for the public's help in retracing where the family had been in recent days. In 2014, a photograph of a tear-streaked Devonte hugging Sgt. Bret Barnum during a tense \\"Black Lives Matter\\" demonstration in downtown Portland garnered global attention. The photo, originally published by The Oregonian/OregonLive, was featured in national media, reached No. 1 on the social-sharing website Reddit and drew widespread Facebook attention. \\"Jen and Sarah were the kinds of parents this world desperately needs,\\" said Portland photographer Zippy Lomax, who had known the family since 2012. \\"They loved their kids more than anything else.\\" The Hart family was a regular at Oregon festivals and shows, Lomax said, including the Beloved festival in Tidewater. They also joined presidential candidate Bernie Sanders onstage during a 2016 rally in Vancouver. \\"They weren't plugged in to the technology,\\" she said. \\"They preferred to lay [around] and read books and hang out with their chickens.\\" Devonte frequently wore the \\"Free hugs\\" sign that produced the famous photograph. Lomax said the sign prompted other memorable interactions as Devonte and strangers embraced. But the reaction to that 2014 moment overwhelmed the family, Lomax said, with much negative attention focused on the multiracial family with lesbian parents. \\"They got a lot of negativity from that, and they kind of closed off for a while, honestly,\\" Lomax said. The family frequently traveled together, Lomax said, taking scenic routes to explore new places and new vistas. She imagines that's what they were doing when the fatal crash occurred. Court records and recent neighbors, however, portray a family that was at times strained. The Harts and their children left their home Friday shortly after no one answered the door for a visit by the authorities, according to neighbors and the Clark County Sheriff's Office. Bruce and Dana DeKalb, who lived next door, said they rarely spoke with the family, which about 10 months ago moved to the remote wooded area in northern Clark County. Dana DeKalb said Devonte had come to their home a dozen times to ask for food, saying his parents had withheld it as a form of punishment. The teen would ask the couple to leave the food by the fence they shared so his parents wouldn't know, she said. Such interactions prompted the DeKalbs to contact authorities, they said Wednesday outside their home. A Clark County deputy accompanied Cowlitz County Child Protective Services to the Hart family's home Friday but nobody answered the door, Sgt. Brent Waddell, a Clark County Sheriff's Office spokesman, told The Oregonian/OregonLive on Wednesday. The family and its SUV were gone the next day, Bruce DeKalb said. Norah West, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, on Wednesday said the agency attempted to contact the family three times after receiving reports of abuse or neglect but was unsuccessful. Court records in Minnesota show Sarah Hart received a 90-day suspended jail sentence and a year of probation in 2011 after her six-year-old daughter arrived at school with bruises on her stomach and back. The girl told a teacher, \\"Mom hit me,\\" according to records. Shortly after, the family moved to West Linn, where they lived until relocating to Woodland. Bill Groener, who lived next door to the family in West Linn, said they kept to themselves and the kids mostly stayed indoors – even in good weather. Groener said the only contact he had with the family is when they went out to get the mail. \\"Something,\\" Groener said, \\"just didn't seem right.\\" Oregonian/OregonLive staff writers Eder Campuzano, Tom Hallman, Jr., Mike Rogaway and Molly Young, along with The Associated Press, contributed to this report. -- Shane Dixon Kavanaugh skavanaugh@oregonian.com 503-294-7632 || @shanedkavanaugh ||||| CLOSE Devonte Hart was captured hugging a police officer during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, MO.

USA TODAY Investigators with the California Highway Patrol work at the scene where a couple and several of their children plunged in their SUV off Highway 1, Wednesday, March 28, 2018, near Fort Bragg, Calif. (Photo: Chris Calder, AP) PORTLAND, Ore. — Three children were still missing Wednesday after an SUV went over a cliff this week along the Northern California coast, killing their parents and three of their siblings. One of the missing children is Devonte Hart, an African-American boy who gained widespread attention in November 2014 when a photo of him hugging a police officer during a Ferguson-related protest in Portland went viral. Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman said investigators believe all six children were in the SUV during the crash, but a search is continuing as part of the investigation. “We have every indication to believe all six children were in there; however, only three bodies have been recovered,\\" Allman said. According to the California Highway Patrol, Devonte's adoptive parents, Jennifer and Sarah Hart, both 39, died Monday when their 2003 GMC Yukon drove off a cliff on the Pacific Coast Highway, plunging about 100 feet into the rocky ocean. Devonte Hart’s siblings, 19-year-old Markis, 14-year-old Jeremiah and 14-year-old Abigail, were also killed. In this Nov. 25, 2014, file photo provided by Johnny Nguyen, Portland police Sgt. Bret Barnum, left, and Devonte Hart, 12, hug at a rally in Portland, Ore., where people had gathered in support of the protests in Ferguson, Mo. Authorities have said two women and three children were killed Monday, March 26, 2018, when their SUV fell from a cliff along Pacific Coast Highway in Mendocino County. Hart is one of the three other children still missing after the vehicle fell off a cliff. He had gained fame when this picture of him hugging the white police officer during the protest went viral. (Photo: Johnny Huu Nguyen, AP) The two women were still in the vehicle and their children's bodies were found out of the vehicle. Police are still looking for 15-year-old Devonte and his other siblings, 16-year-old Hannah Hart and 12-year-old Sierra Hart. The California Highway Patrol has not determined why the vehicle went off the overlook. Investigators have no reason to believe the crash was intentional, he said. Officials in Oregon and Washington, where the family has lived, have not been able to find the missing children at their home in a small city outside Portland, Ore., or with family members and friends. Bill Groener, 67, was a next-door neighbor of the family when they lived in West Linn, Ore., and described the siblings as foster children.

The kids were all home-schooled. They stayed indoors most of the time, even in really nice weather,” Groener told AP. Devonte Hart, who was 12 at the time that the photo was taken, hugged Portland Police Sgt. Bret Barnum during a rally in Portland the day after a grand jury decided not to charge Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. A photo of the hug, taken by freelance photographer Johnny Nguyen and first published on OregonLive.com, went viral and was shared several hundred thousand times on Facebook. Barnum told The Oregonian he saw Hart standing in the crowd, with tears in his eyes and holding a sign that read, \\"Free Hugs.\\" He called Hart over and they talked briefly about the protest and other topics, like art, school and life. He then asked Hart for a hug.

Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding the pesticide safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

Step 1: Determine the hobbies for each friend I decide that David's hobby is model building, while Anna's hobby is gardening. These hobbies are different but share some commonalities, which will make the discussion interesting. Step 2: Write a conversational opening I start with a casual and friendly greeting to set the tone for the dialogue and create a sense of familiarity between the friends. --- David: Hey Anna, it's been a while! How have you been? Anna: Hi David! I'm doing well, thanks. Just been busy with my gardening. How about you? Step 3: Introduce the topic of hobbies In this step, I make sure that the conversation transitions smoothly into the topic of hobbies since that's the primary focus of the dialogue. --- David: Ah, gardening. That's a great hobby. I've been spending a lot of time working on my model building lately.

Options: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","output":"(3). No, it is incorrect to assume that all of Clint Eastwood's films are action films or that they all subvert the action genre. Clint Eastwood, as an actor and filmmaker, has an extensive filmography that spans over several genres, including westerns, crime dramas, suspense thrillers, and even romantic dramas. While some of Eastwood's films like the \\"Dirty Harry\\" series, \\"A Fistful of Dollars,\\" \\"For a Few Dollars More,\\" and \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" exemplify his most iconic contributions to the action genre, many of his other movies are not action films. Some of the non-action films in which Eastwood starred or directed include \\"Play Misty for Me,\\" \\"Tightrope,\\" \\"The Bridges of Madison County,\\" \\"Gran Torino,\\" \\"Million Dollar Baby,\\" and \\"Sully.\\" It is essential to analyze each of Eastwood's films individually to determine if they subvert the action genre. In some cases, Eastwood's films contain elements that comment on or challenge traditional action conventions. In his revisionist westerns such as \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"High Plains Drifter,\\" Eastwood deconstructs the archetypal western hero and challenges the narrative of the Man with No Name made famous in the \\"Dollars Trilogy.\\" These films invite viewers to question the ethics and morality of the actions taken by the protagonists. In \\"Gran Torino,\\" Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a retired and grumpy Korean War veteran who confronts a local gang causing trouble in his neighborhood. Although it is a drama, the film does contain some suspenseful and tense moments reminiscent of an action film. However, it deviates from the classic action formula by focusing on themes such as intergenerational relationships, cultural diversity, and redemption. Similarly, Eastwood's Academy Award-winning film \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" tells the story of an aging boxing trainer who takes a female boxer under his wing. While boxing action is present in the film, it is primarily a sports drama focusing on the emotional bonds formed between the characters. In conclusion, it is not accurate to say that all of Clint Eastwood's films are action movies or that they all subvert the action genre. His filmography comprises an array of genres, including dramas, westerns, thrillers, and romantic films. While some of his movies, particularly his westerns and crime films, can be seen as subverting or commenting on the action genre's conventions, it is crucial to consider each work separately and recognize Eastwood's diverse contributions to the film industry as both an actor and a filmmaker."},{"instruction":"Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Have I seen a worse movie? Perhaps only \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate\\" dragged more than \\"Dukes\\". I had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point. Let's touch on a few... There was a noticeable script death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the Dukes and they don't respond. He shrugs and moves on, since neither the Knoxville or Scott know what he's talking about (nor do we). It was like the engine died and was restarted. The few times the General Lee flew through the air weren't even that exciting. Nothing I haven't seen on the TV Series. Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo is upset at Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it (although roughly). The rest of the time it seems distant and forced. Seann William Scott's awful, horrendous accent (or lack thereof). I hated Willie Nelson's performance. Were bad jokes supposed to be endearing? I wanted him to disappear. Jessica Simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen. She actually felt like one of the better actors in the film. That's telling you how horrible this movie is. She's a goddess. During the climax of the film, I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. A nuclear bomb would have sufficed. This is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film, but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film. If only we could erase and start over...","output":"The sentiment of the given review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses considerable disappointment and frustration with various aspects of the movie, such as the plot, script, acting, and chemistry among the actors. They compare the film to another notoriously bad movie, \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate,\\" which sets the tone of dissatisfaction from the beginning. The reviewer points out several issues with the film, including: 1. The script's inconsistencies, awkward transitions and failure to engage the audience. 2. A lack of excitement in the action sequences, specifically mentioning the General Lee stunt scenes. 3. Poor chemistry between the lead actors, Knoxville and Scott, with their interactions feeling distant and forced. 4. Seann William Scott's unconvincing accent. 5. A distaste for Willie Nelson's performance and his character's attempts at humor. 6. A preference for the supposed villain's (Boss Hogg) victory during the climax, as opposed to siding with the protagonists. However, there is a single positive sentiment mentioned in the review. The reviewer praises Jessica Simpson's performance and refers to her as one of the better actors in the film, calling her a \\"goddess.\\" In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is primarily negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration at the missed opportunity to create a heartwarming film and a desire to erase and start over."},{"instruction":"Produce a brief English sentence that would be considered grammatically acceptable","output":"Though the task only requires a brief and grammatically acceptable English sentence, it is worth discussing various aspects of the English language which contribute to grammar and sentence construction, before finally presenting the requested sentence. The English language is characterized by a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, which represents the typical structure for a sentence. A grammatically acceptable sentence consists of a subject (person, place, or thing performing an action), a verb (the action being performed), and often an object (the recipient of the action). Furthermore, there are multiple aspects of grammar that can be considered while forming an English sentence, such as tense, which represents the time an action takes place. Tenses include past, present, and future, and can have different forms, such as simple, continuous, perfect, and perfect continuous. Other essential elements to consider are articles like \\"a,\\" \\"an,\\" and \\"the,\\" prepositions like \\"in,\\" \\"on,\\" \\"at,\\" parts of speech including nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions like \\"and,\\" \\"but,\\" \\"or.\\" It is not enough to consider just the sentence, but also its usage in a context, as context can dictate the appropriateness of a sentence based on its construction, topic, intent, tone, and vocabulary. A well-constructed sentence should not only abide by grammatical rules, but flow naturally and convey the intended information effectively. Additionally, English is a highly flexible language with various styles such as informal, formal, colloquial, and technical, which further broadens the range of possible grammatically acceptable sentences. However, understanding some basic principles can help create a structure that is easily understood and adheres to linguistic norms. Now, considering all the elements mentioned above, a brief, accurate, and grammatically acceptable English sentence that encapsulates a subject, verb, and object can be presented as follows: \\"The dog chased the ball.\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What key details about mohan munasinghe can be extracted from the following bio?

Translate to French","output":"Cette période est incluse dans la période excédentaire. La période excédentaire fait référence à un laps de temps pendant lequel les ressources, les biens ou les services disponibles sont supérieurs à la demande. Ce concept est souvent utilisé pour décrire des situations économiques, commerciales ou agricoles. Lorsqu'on dit que \\"cette période est incluse dans la période excédentaire\\", cela signifie que la période en question fait partie d'une phase où un excédent est observé. En termes économiques, un excédent peut être bénéfique pour les consommateurs car il contribue généralement à la baisse des prix. En effet, lorsque l'offre dépasse la demande, les producteurs et les vendeurs sont incités à réduire leurs prix pour attirer les clients et écouler leur stock. Cette situation profite également aux exportateurs, qui peuvent vendre leurs surplus sur les marchés internationaux. Néanmoins, un excédent prolongé peut avoir des conséquences négatives sur l'économie. Par exemple, si les agriculteurs produisent trop de nourriture et qu'ils ne peuvent pas la vendre rapidement, ils pourraient être confrontés à d'importantes pertes financières. De même, une surproduction chronique dans le secteur industriel peut entraîner des fermetures d'usines et des pertes d'emplois. En ce qui concerne la période mentionnée dans votre demande, cette période est considérée comme faisant partie d'une période excédentaire. Cela peut signifier que, pendant cette période, il y a eu une abondance de ressources ou de biens disponibles pour les consommateurs ou les entreprises. Pour analyser les implications de cette situation, il est important de considérer les causes de l'excédent et les éventuelles mesures à prendre pour éviter une crise économique. En somme, la traduction « Cette période est incluse dans la période excédentaire » fait référence à un moment où un excédent est observé. Les effets de cette situation dépendent largement de la durée de l'excédent, des mesures prises pour le gérer et de l'industrie concernée."},{"instruction":"Information: - The City of Shepparton was a local government area in the Goulburn Valley region, about north of Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia.

I wanted a pleasant dinner, but instead, I was left with a bewilderingly poor experience that still haunts me. Upon entering the restaurant, the first thing that struck me was the pervasive odor. The smell of stale grease permeated the entire establishment. I would have hoped it was only a passing scent, but unfortunately, it lingered throughout the entire meal. With high expectations, I was hoping for exceptional service, but this was another area where The Homestead fell short. The hostess who greeted us was visibly uninterested in her job and seemed more preoccupied with her phone than accommodating the patrons. After waiting for over 15 minutes without acknowledgement in the half-empty restaurant, we were finally led to a table in a corner near the restrooms – an area that only seemed to exacerbate the foul smell. The atmosphere of The Homestead was the exact opposite of inviting and warm. The dim lighting made it difficult to fully admire the plates set before us, and the tables were arranged haphazardly with some placed too close for comfort. Moreover, the dining area was punctuated by a cacophony of sounds, which strangled our conversations throughout the meal. Given the issues mentioned above, I was hoping that the cuisine would compensate for the disappointing dining experience. However, the food was lackluster and uninspired. I ordered the beef stroganoff, which arrived with an unappetizing presentation and a bland taste. How could a dish with such an array of flavors and ingredients be so devoid of taste? I cannot fathom it. The meat in the dish was also tough and chewy, making it difficult to enjoy. My partner had the audacity to order the seafood linguine, and it proved to be an unfortunate choice. Not only was the pasta severely undercooked – practically crunchy – but also the seafood component seemed to be bordering on dangerously inedible due to questionable freshness. To add insult to injury, our server was not attentive in any regard. After the initial introduction, they seemed to vanish into thin air, and our attempts to get their attention went unanswered. When we finally managed to request the check, we were met with the pièce de résistance – a bill that was astronomically overpriced for the ghastly experience. In conclusion, The Homestead Restaurant left me feeling rather betrayed and frustrated.

Dora is a young Latina girl who goes on various adventures in an animated world with her talking purple backpack and an anthropomorphic monkey named Boots. Created by Chris Gifford, Valerie Walsh, and Eric Weiner, the show 'Dora the Explorer' debuted on Nickelodeon and is popular among pre-school age children. Dora was designed to introduce viewers to Spanish. Throughout each episode, Dora teaches Spanish words or phrases to the viewers. For instance, she often asks viewers to say a Spanish word or phrase along with her to overcome a problem. This interactive component quickly became a signature part of the show, contributing to its popularity and success. Plus, making language learning a part of an epic adventure with fun characters makes the learning feel more like play than a chore. The anthropomorphic blue-booted monkey named Boots is Dora's best friend and main travel companion. He's called Boots because of his striking red boots. Boots is always seen on Dora's various trips and provides her assistance and information during their adventures. His friendly, enthusiastic personality, and undying optimism, charm children who are watching. The character of Swiper is a sneaky fox who tries to throw Dora and Boots off track during their missions. Swiper is always out to steal something from Dora, hence the name \\"Swiper\\". Dora and Boots often prevent Swiper from stealing by saying, \\"Swiper, no swiping!\\" three times. Despite his usual antagonistic role, Swiper is not a traditional villain. At times, he's shown to have a good heart and even helps Dora and Boots on occasion. The show gained massive popularity and critical acclaim globally not only for its entertainment value but also for its educational content. Dora the Explorer was a trailblazing show that popularized the incorporation of learning a foreign language into kid's TV programs. Over the years, it has inspired several spin-offs, merchandise, video games, and even a live-action movie adaptation. It has left a remarkable impact on kids' TV programming and continues to be loved by many."},{"instruction":"Jony Ive appeared to attack the Moto Maker scheme in an interview in which he criticised the idea of giving consumers huge choice over how their handsets were made to appear. Rick Osterloh, president of Motorola, told the BBC his company had a \\"different philosophy\\". And he criticised Apple in turn, calling its prices \\"outrageous\\". Sir Jonathan specifically asked the New Yorker magazine not to name the company he had been \\"scathing about\\", but a campaign launched by Motorola in late 2013 matches the description he gave. \\"Their value proposition was, 'Make it whatever you want.

Mr Osterloh of the scheme: \\"Our belief is that the end user should be directly involved in the process of designing products. \\"We're making the entire product line accessible. \\"And frankly, we're taking a directly opposite approach to them [Apple].\\" He added that he believed this difference in strategy went wider than design. \\"We do see a real dichotomy in this marketplace, where you've got people like Apple making so much money and charging such outrageous prices.

Brannan's ex-girlfriend Christine Corley says that he falsely accused her of hitting him and is a 'master manipulator' Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Tennis Pro Accused of Assault: The Twisted Tale of Ivan Brannan, Master Manipulator In a recent shocking revelation, Ivan Brannan, 28, has accused a professional tennis player of assaulting him in a Florida gym on Valentine's Day. Brannan, a former tennis prodigy himself, has been embroiled in a tumultuous relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Christine Corley, who now claims that Brannan is a \\"master manipulator\\" and has a history of making false accusations. The alleged assault reportedly occurred on the romantic holiday, when Brannan claims that he had been punched by the unnamed tennis pro. The incident has sent shockwaves through the sports community, as it would signify severe misconduct on the part of a professional athlete. A police report has been filed, and an investigation is currently underway to determine the veracity of Brannan's allegations. However, it seems that Brannan's credibility is being called into question by none other than his ex-girlfriend, Christine Corley. In an exclusive interview, Corley revealed that Brannan had falsely accused her of hitting him in the past. She described her former flame as a \\"master manipulator\\" with a penchant for twisting the truth to serve his purposes. Corley's allegations against Brannan paint a troubling picture of a man who may stop at nothing to create drama and attention. In her words, Brannan used the accusations against her to manipulate and control her, turning their relationship into a toxic, emotionally fraught experience. With her account in mind, it begs the question: could Brannan be fabricating the assault charges against the tennis pro? While the investigation is still ongoing, the unraveling story raises important concerns about character assassination and the consequences of manipulating the truth. Not only do false allegations damage the reputations of the accused, but they also have a lasting impact on the credibility of actual victims of assault. Should Brannan's claims prove to be unfounded, there may be severe repercussions for both his reputation and the credibility of similar accusations in the future. In the world of professional sports, personal drama can often overshadow the talent and dedication of athletes. Fans and the media alike have long been captivated by controversies and scandals. However, it is crucial to maintain a balanced perspective and recognize the importance of due process, especially when dealing with serious accusations like Brannan's. As the investigation into these allegations continues, it remains to be seen whether Ivan Brannan's claims hold any truth or if they are simply the machinations of a \\"master manipulator\\". Either way, it is a disheartening story that reminds us that even in the world of professional sports, personal drama can still cast a long shadow."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A man in a camouflage tank top standing next to a man in a gray t-shirt with a fountain in the background.\\" can we conclude that \\"Two men pose in front of a fountain while touring a national exhibit.\\"?

Gills are essential for the survival of many fish species, including groupers, and set them apart from air-breathing animals. Therefore, the appropriate selection from the given options would be outside the provided list, as \\"gills\\" is not included in the available choices. To understand the significance of gills in the survival of aquatic animals like groupers, it is crucial to delve deeper into their structure, function, and the conditions that can affect their ability to function effectively. Gills are typically composed of thin, flat filaments that are covered in tiny, finger-like projections called lamellae. These specialized structures provide an extensive surface area to facilitate the exchange of gases, enabling the fish to extract oxygen from the water and expel carbon dioxide, a byproduct of cellular respiration. The density and arrangement of these filaments and lamellae vary depending on the species, with some fish possessing more or less, according to their specific needs and habitat conditions. Water, rich in dissolved oxygen, is drawn into the fish's mouth and forced over the gills as it swims or pumps its gill covers (operculum). Oxygen molecules in the water pass through the thin walls of the gill filaments and into the fish's bloodstream, while carbon dioxide diffuses out from the blood into the water. In the case of the grouper, they are typically found in saltwater environments such as coral reefs, rocky seabeds, and mangroves. However, some species can also inhabit estuaries or brackish waters, adjusting their gill function to accommodate fluctuations in water salinity. Now, let's briefly discuss why the other multi-select options are not suitable: 1. Tips: While some fish possess special adaptations to increase sensory perception — such as barbels or whisker-like projections near their mouths — these structures are not responsible for gas exchange or breathing in water. 2. Noses: Fish do possess nostrils, which lead to their olfactory organs responsible for detecting scents and chemicals in their aquatic environments. However, these structures do not participate in breathing or extracting oxygen from the water. 3. Neck slits: Fish do not have necks like terrestrial animals, and therefore there are no \\"neck slits\\" that would facilitate the exchange of gases underwater. 4. Wings: Some fish, such as flying fish, are equipped with specialized fins that they use to glide above the water surface for short distances. Nevertheless, these structures play no role in the respiratory process of the fish. In conclusion, a grouper will breathe beneath the surface of a pond, or any other aquatic environment, due to its specialized respiratory structures called gills. The given options do not accurately describe the means by which a grouper can extract dissolved oxygen from water; thus, the correct response is not present in the available choices."},{"instruction":"Give a quick stream of consciousness before answering the following question.

Zeus Answer:","output":"Title: The Divine Quest of Perseus Genre: Fantasy, Adventure, Action Plot: In the celestial realm, a bitter rivalry arises between the gods as they compete for influence over the mortal world. Demigods and heroes are granted special favors by their divine parents to undo their rival's works, but Zeus, the King of the Gods, is wary of the escalating conflict. Frustrated by the gods' interference, he devises a plan to demonstrate the true power of the divine - a quest that no mortal or god has ever completed. Zeus selects Perseus, his demigod son, to undertake this divine quest. However, to ensure Perseus doesn't receive unfair help from other gods, Zeus declares that only one gift may be offered to him - Athena's intellect and wisdom. Thus, Zeus commands Athena to give Perseus her legendary and wise owl, Bubo. The owl Bubo is gifted to Perseus and serves as a wise and intelligent guide to help him fulfill this impossible task. They set off on their journey, gathering a crew of skilled warriors and misfits, each with unique abilities crucial to the success of their quest. Together, they embark on an epic adventure through a mythological world filled with treacherous landscapes, cursed creatures, and powerful sorcery. As their journey unfolds, they uncover a fiendish plot orchestrated by Hades, the God of the Underworld, who seeks to usurp Zeus and seize control of the heavens. To do so, Hades conspires with titans and monsters long thought vanquished, terrorizing the world and provoking chaos. Perseus and his crew must navigate the twisted machinations of divine politics and confront their own inner fears as they draw closer to their final confrontation with Hades. The climax of the film sees Perseus and his companions infiltrate Hades' stronghold within the Underworld, where they must face their most lethal trials yet. Through their courage, cunning, and the wise guidance of Bubo, they thwart Hades' minions and persevere against overwhelming odds. With the celestial realm hanging in the balance, Perseus confronts Hades in an epic battle of power, fate, and destiny. In the end, Perseus triumphs, not through brute force but through his wisdom and intellect, revealing the true power of Zeus and Athena's gift. The gods, humbled by the might of Perseus' resilience and wisdom, finally recognize the importance of harmony and balance between the celestial and mortal worlds. Zeus restores peace among the gods and decrees that they must act with restraint in guiding humanity's destiny. With his quest complete, Perseus returns to the mortal realm as a legend, the embodiment of wisdom and heroism. The tale of his divine quest and triumph echoes through the ages, inspiring countless generations to strive for wisdom and greatness in the face of adversity.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"A war involving major oil producing nations would certainly have various direct and indirect effects on the process of greenhouse gas emissions, potentially leading to a temporary reduction in emissions. However, it is essential to consider all the factors, both positive and negative, that would contribute to this reduction and to analyze the consequences and implications of such a conflict on the global environment. Direct Effects: 1. Disrupted oil production and distribution: As the major oil producing nations are involved in a war, it is reasonable to expect that oil production and distribution would be significantly disrupted. With reduced access to oil, the global demand for this fossil fuel will outweigh its supply, leading to reduced burning of oil and, subsequently, lower carbon dioxide emissions from engines that rely on it. 2. Reduced industrial activity: Due to the disruption of oil supplies, industries and manufacturing plants that depend on oil for energy-related needs will likely experience a slowdown or even temporary closure. This, in turn, would lead to less energy consumption, fewer emissions, and less waste generated by those industries. 3. Limited transportation: Fuel shortages resulting from the war would restrict transportation activities, both personal and commercial. Fewer vehicles on the road would mean less engine-produced carbon dioxide, further driving down greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect Effects: 1. Economic impact: A war involving major oil producing nations would have severe economic repercussions, not only for the warring countries but also for the global economy. The resulting economic slowdown or recession could lead to lower production and consumption levels, bringing down greenhouse gas emissions as a side effect. 2. Changes in energy sources: The lack of oil availability might force countries and industries to explore alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. The transition to cleaner energy sources would reduce carbon dioxide and methane emissions. 3. Waste reduction: As industries generate less waste, there will be a corresponding decline in waste decomposition that produces methane. However, it's important to note that waste from other sources (households, agriculture, etc.) may not experience a similar decline, thereby not significantly impacting methane production on a wider scale. Despite these effects pointing towards a temporary reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, several consequences should be taken into account as well, such as: 1. Environmental damage: The physical destruction resulting from the war may exacerbate environmental problems. For instance, attacks on oil infrastructure can lead to oil spills, which are detrimental to both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. 2. Carbon emissions from military activities: Wars often involve significant military operations that consume resources and produce emissions, such as the burning of fossil fuels in tanks, airplanes, or other military vehicles. These emissions could offset some of the reductions from disrupted oil production and distribution. 3. Long-term implications: Once the war ends, there will likely be a drive to ramp up oil production to replenish global reserves and revive economies. This could lead to increased oil production and, subsequently, a substantial rise in carbon dioxide emissions. In conclusion, a war involving major oil producing nations could cause a temporary reduction in greenhouse gas emissions due to disrupted production and distribution, economic impacts, changes in energy sources, and waste reduction. However, the environmental damage caused by the war, carbon emissions from military activities, and the potential for a long-term increase in emissions due to post-war recovery efforts must also be taken into consideration. The perturbation posed by the war does indeed have direct and indirect effects on the process, but it is crucial to weigh these against the many detrimental factors that such a conflict would precipitate."},{"instruction":"What is the title of this article: When Zeus struck down Apollo's son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting Hippolytus from the dead (transgressing Themis by stealing Hades's subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.

Ultrasonic tells the tale of Simon York – music teacher, married, soon to be father. Simon plays in a band and dreams of one day getting paid to write music. For now, however, money is tight and Simon shelling out 2000 to record an album is an additional cause of stress on his marriage to Ruth. Jonas is Ruth's troubled brother and spends his days handing out flyers and trying to, \\"open peoples' eyes,\\" to his theories of conspiracies and injustices in the world.

His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins.

In the first sentence, \\"He held the title for two years,\\" the word \\"title\\" refers to a position, rank, or distinction that a person holds, typically in a competitive or hierarchical setting. This usage often refers to sporting events, where athletes compete to win various championships or titles. Alternatively, it could refer to an expert in a particular field who is recognized and labeled as such. In this context, \\"title\\" signifies a victory or an accomplishment. The sentence implies that the person maintained this prestigious status for the duration of two years. In the second sentence, \\"He had no documents confirming his title to his father's estate,\\" the word \\"title\\" has a different meaning altogether. Here, it refers to a legal document that signifies a person's ownership rights over a specific property or piece of land. In this context, title plays a key role in the transfer process of property among individuals. The sentence suggests that the individual could not prove legal ownership over his father's estate due to a lack of appropriate documentation. In summary, while the word \\"title\\" is used in both sentences, it carries distinct meanings and different connotations.

Yes 2). No If I tell you that A solar panel converts sunlight into electrons in motion, and ask you the question \\"what does a solar panel convert sunlight into?\\", is the correct answer \\"adding heat\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"adding heat.\\" A solar panel converts sunlight into electricity through a process called the photovoltaic effect. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation of how solar panels work and the process of converting sunlight into electricity. A solar panel, also known as a photovoltaic (PV) module, is made up of numerous solar cells. These cells are typically made from silicon, a semiconductor material that is abundant in the Earth's crust. The silicon cells in the solar panels can be either monocrystalline or polycrystalline. The process of converting sunlight into electricity using a solar panel involves the following steps: 1. Absorption of sunlight: When sunlight, in the form of photons, strikes the surface of the solar panel, it may either be absorbed by the solar cells, reflected off the surface, or pass through the panel. 2. Generation of electron-hole pairs: When photons with sufficient energy are absorbed by the semiconductor material in the solar cells, they transfer their energy to the electrons present in the material's atoms. This energy transfer causes the electrons to break free from their parent atoms, leaving behind an empty space called a \\"hole.\\" This generation of free electrons and holes is the initial step in the conversion of sunlight into electricity. 3. Separation of charge carriers: In a solar cell, a p-n junction is created by introducing impurities into the semiconductor material. The p-n junction separates the solar cell into two regions with different electric charge concentrations: the p-type region with an excess of positive charges, and the n-type region with an excess of negative charges. When free electrons and holes are generated by the absorption of sunlight, they are quickly separated by the electric field established at the p-n junction. The electrons move towards the n-type region, while the holes travel towards the p-type region. 4. Collection of charge carriers: As the negatively charged electrons are attracted towards the n-type region and the positively charged holes towards the p-type region, these charge carriers are collected by metal contacts placed on the top and bottom surfaces of the solar cell. This creates a flow of electric current from the top contact to the bottom contact. 5. Conversion of direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC): The current generated by a solar panel is direct current (DC). However, most electrical devices and appliances used in homes and businesses operate on alternating current (AC). Therefore, the DC current generated by the solar panel needs to be converted into AC using a device called an inverter. In summary, a solar panel converts sunlight into electricity by absorbing photons, generating free electrons and holes, separating the charge carriers, collecting them via metal contacts to produce an electric current, and finally, converting the generated direct current into alternating current for use in homes and businesses.

The correct ending to the paragraph should be \\"[iii] are playing ping pong.\\" This option maintains the focus on the boys playing ping pong and concludes the idea introduced in the first sentence. Here are the explanations for why the other answers are wrong: [i] up and the boy in a red shirt gives him a hard time - This option seems unrelated to the main idea and introduces a conflict that isn't supported by the given information. [ii] up and throw the ball up onto the orange striped pole - This sentence doesn't fit the original idea of describing the boys playing ping pong. Instead, it talks about a specific action of throwing the ball onto a pole, which doesn't make sense in the context of playing ping pong. [iv] up and sit on a green ping pong table and play - This option is problematic because sitting on a ping pong table is not how the game is played. It also doesn't make sense considering the boys are already playing the game in a big room, and the description of the table as green is not relevant to the main idea."},{"instruction":"Q: Q: What kind of ions are named by adding the suffix -ide to the end?

Answer choices: - a cuticle - bones - Joules - neurons - the skin - loose soil - fibrils - muscle A:","output":"The correct answer is: fibrils. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue found in many areas of the body, including the joints, ears, nose, bronchial tubes, and between the bones of the spine and ribs. It's a flexible and robust material that functions to support, connect, and cushion various body structures. The fundamental component of cartilage is a protein called collagen, which arranges itself into an overlapping network of long, thin structures known as fibrils. These fibrils intertwine and bundle together to provide cartilage with its characteristic strength and elasticity. Let's debunk the other choices: - A cuticle, in biology, refers to the outermost protective layer found in various organisms like plants and insects. It is non-living material and is not a part of human cartilage. - Bones are rigid structures that make up the skeleton. They provide support and protection for the body and are not a part of the cartilage, although they do interact with cartilage. - Joules is a unit of measurement for energy or work in the International System of Units. It is utterly unrelated to the biological makeup of cartilage. - Neurons are the basic units of the nervous system. They are specialized cells that are involved in transmitting signals and carrying out the functions of the nervous system. They are not involved in the structure of cartilage. - The skin is the body's largest organ. It serves to protect the body from the outside environment. While skin and cartilage both fall under the category of connective tissue, they are composed of different types of cells and serve different functions. - Loose soil does not have any association with cartilage. This term is a geologic concept and is irrelevant to the composition of cartilage. - Muscles are tissue that contracts and relaxes to create movement. Muscles and cartilage are separate types of tissue with different structures and roles within the body. So, it is clear that among the given choices, fibrils are the foundational components of the tough cartilage tissue."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

They gave us someone to write to from that school. For three months, I've written to a girl called Louisa, who is the same age as me. It' s been more interesting to hear about her life. She' s told me all about her school and described her daily life. I can' t believe that her School doesn' t. have any electricity. She goes to 'school from eight o' clock in the morning until six. O'clock. in the evening. I can' t believe how lucky we are here! She' s also told me that she often can' t go to school because she has to look after her baby brother and sister.

How many bricks of other types than mentioned is he going to use?","output":"Step 1: Determine the number of type A bricks required. Mike needs at least 40 bricks of type A. Step 2: Determine the number of type B bricks required. He needs half as many type B bricks as type A bricks, so the number of type B bricks required is 40 / 2 = 20 bricks. Step 3: Calculate the total number of type A and type B bricks. The total number of type A and type B bricks is 40 (type A) + 20 (type B) = 60 bricks. Step 4: Determine the number of other types of bricks required. To find out how many bricks of other types than mentioned he is going to use, subtract the total number of type A and type B bricks from the total number of bricks he needs to use (150 bricks).

Earlier, UK police said they had stopped sharing information with the US as a consequence but those ties have now been resumed. The decision to end the suspension was taken after assurances were received by counter-terrorism officers in the UK. A diplomatic tiff broke out after the New York Times published photos on Wednesday appearing to show debris from the crime scene, including bloodstained fragments from the bomb. The move outraged British police and government officials, and prompted Mr Trump to address the matter during a visit to Brussels. \\"These leaks have been going on for a long time,\\" he said.

The raid comes after Salman Abedi blew himself up at the end of an Ariana Grande concert three days ago, killing 22 people and injuring 116.

In total 10 people have been arrested in the UK since Monday night. A man and a woman have since been released without charge. Eight men remain in custody as part of the ongoing investigation.

Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent It could be over in hours - or it could take weeks. That's how unknowable an acute counter-terrorism investigation can be for MI5 and the police. While there is a sense that there has been significant headway in the last 24 hours, we should be careful about reading too much, too soon, into how long it will take Greater Manchester Police and their colleagues to be sure they have dealt with every single possible lead after Monday's events. In recent years, we've got a greater understanding of how the more secretive end of these massive operations play out. At any one time, MI5 is handling in the region of 500 active investigations involving 3,000 \\"SOIs\\" - \\"subjects of interest\\" in security world jargon. Read more from Dominic here.

It is also being reported that a Libyan government spokesman said 15 minutes before he blew himself up, Abedi called his mother and brother.

Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning ||||| The bomber in the Manchester terrorist attack appeared to have carried a powerful explosive in a lightweight metal container concealed either within a black vest or a blue Karrimor backpack, and may have held a small switch in his left hand, according to preliminary information gathered by British authorities. Remnants of backpack The initial analysis of the bomb, based on evidence photographed and collected at the crime scene and distributed by British authorities, does not specify the size or type of explosive used in the bomb’s main charge but suggests an improvised device made with forethought and care. Possible switch located in suspect’s left hand Law enforcement images of metal nuts and screws propelled by the blast, and of damage nearby, show that the bomb’s makeshift shrapnel penetrated metal doors and left deep scuffs in brick walls. Nuts and screws used as shrapnel And the authorities’ review of the blast site shows that many of the fatalities occurred in a nearly complete circle around the bomber, Salman Abedi, whose upper torso was heaved outside the lethal ring toward the Manchester Arena entrance.

The location of the bomber’s torso, and the apparent absence of fatalities in a line between the blast site and where his remains landed, was said by one explosive disposal technician who examined the images to indicate that the explosive charge was more likely in a backpack than in a vest, and propelled the bomber away from the blast. Manchester Arena Exit Stage Exit Exit Parking Exit Blast area People seen running down these stairs in video. Victoria Station Train tracks Manchester Arena Exit Stage Exit Exit Exit Blast area Victoria Station Train tracks The New York Times Certain details of the bomb further suggest a desire by a bomb-maker to reduce the risk of a dud. The authorities found a mangled Yuasa 12-volt, 2.1 amp-hour lead acid battery at the scene, which is more powerful than batteries often seen in backpack bombs or suicide vests. The battery, used for emergency lighting and other applications, can be bought for about 20. 12-volt battery that was possible power source A possible switch to initiate the explosion, carried in the bomber’s left hand, was also unusual in a suicide device, in that it appears to have contained a small circuit board soldered inside one end. It is not clear from the law enforcement images if the object was a simple plunger switch, or included a timer or a receiver that could be operated remotely via radio signal – or some combination, or something else. Such redundancy, if the object was the switch, could give the bomber or a cell more than one option for deploying the device, and suggest that the bomb was not as simple in design as many terrorist devices, which often are crude and prone to failure or haphazard effect. One independent analyst of improvised explosive devices, Michael C.L. Johnson, suggested that the object might be an electronic cigarette and unrelated to the bomb’s detonation – an understandable case of investigators focusing on a crime-scene detail early in a case. ||||| The New York Times on Thursday defended publishing crime scene photos from the Manchester terror attack, even as President Donald Trump was blasting leaks about the investigation to the Times and other media outlets that emanated from American sources.

Trump ordered the Justice Department to launch a full investigation into leaks from the Manchester bomb probe. Following the release of crime scene photos from the bombing, President Trump has asked for \\"a complete review\\" of leaks from U.S. government agencies. The president is expected to get an earful from May following the apparent leak at the NATO summit. The British prime minister said she planned to \\"make clear to President Trump that intelligence that is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure.\\" A British official told Fox News that they were \\"pleased that U.S. authorities have launched launched an investigation into breaches of this principle,\\" adding that the U.S. is Britain's \\"closest and most trusted partner\\" and the leaks have not deterred them from working closely on future issues. In the statement, Trump said \\"there is no relationship we cherish more than the Special Relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,\\" and promised that his administration would get to the bottom of the matter. The Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said intelligence sharing with the U.S. relating to the Manchester probe has been suspended. Earlier on Thursday, Manchester police threatened to stop sharing probe information if the leaks to U.S. media continued, according to a British official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. MANCHESTER TERROR ATTACK: BOMBER REPORTEDLY VISITED GERMANY DAYS BEFORE ATTACK Greater Manchester Police condemned the leaks on behalf of the National Counterterrorism Policing units in a statement that suggested a severe rupture in trust between Britain and the United States, whose law enforcement officials have traditionally shared intelligence at the highest levels. \\"When the trust is breached it undermines these relationships, and undermines our investigations and the confidence of victims, witnesses and their family,\\" the statement said. \\"This damage is even greater when it involves unauthorized disclosure of potential evidence in the middle of a major counterterrorism investigation.\\" FATHER, BROTHERS OF MANCHESTER BOMBING SUSPECT ARRESTED Home Secretary Amber Rudd complained the leaks could cost police \\"the element of surprise\\" in their bid to prevent future attacks. Eight men have now been detained in connection with Monday's attack. Those include Abedi's two brothers, Hashim and Ismail, as well as his father, Ramadan Abedi. A woman was arrested late Wednesday, but was released without charge. Manchester police said the arrests were \\"significant\\" and the investigation continues with searches that will take place for several more days. They added they've uncovered items during the raids and searches across the city that are believed to be important to the investigation.

The President's Cup follows a format similar to that of the Ryder Cup, comprising various types of matches, including Foursomes, Fourballs, and Singles. Over the four-day event, a total of 30 points are up for grabs, with each match contributing 1 point. The event has been held for 13 editions, and the distribution of matches and points has slightly evolved over the years. Since 2015, the point structure has been as follows: - On Day 1, there are 5 Fourball matches - On Day 2, there are 5 Foursomes matches - On Day 3, there are 4 Fourball matches in the morning and 4 Foursomes matches in the afternoon - On Day 4, there are 12 Singles matches Thus, a total of 30 points are available, and a team needs to score at least 15.5 points to secure a win. If the overall score is tied at 15-15 at the end of the competition, the President's Cup is shared between the two teams, and both the teams are declared co-champions.

After first-half tries from Ollie Roberts, Jermaine McGillvary and Aaron Murphy, the Giants scored twice more within seven minutes of the restart through Paul Clough and Jordan Turner. Jake Mamo crossed too before McGillvary and Murphy each added a second. Mamo also had two tries chalked off, with Warrington's only response coming through a Tom Lineham try on 53 minutes. Former Salford, Hull and St Helens utility back Turner scored on his debut as Huddersfield's third victory in five matches moved them within a point of Catalans Dragons, who they face next Saturday. Turner, who joined from Canberra last week, was one of two changes, coupled with the key return from a two-match ban of half-back Brough, who kicked five goals.

Therefore, I will delve deeper into the concept of generating an effective and concise sentence by examining its various components, as well as discussing strategies for constructing such sentences. A sentence is a collection of words that conveys a complete thought, typically consisting of a subject and a predicate. The subject refers to the person, place, thing, or idea that the sentence is about, while the predicate contains the verb and provides information about the subject. A brief sentence, in particular, is a short, clear, and precise statement that communicates the necessary information with minimal words. To create a successful brief sentence, consider the following tips: 1. Focus on the main point: Identify the core idea you want to convey and build your sentence around it. Remove any unnecessary or irrelevant information that distracts from this central message. 2. Use precise language: Choose words that accurately capture your intended meaning and avoid ambiguity or vagueness. This may involve selecting specific terms, using active verbs, or employing a direct and concise writing style. 3. Eliminate wordiness: Be mindful of redundancy, and avoid using more words than necessary to convey your point. This can include eliminating repetitive phrases, redundant pairs, and excessive qualifiers. 4. Restructure your sentence: Experiment with different sentence structures and combinations to find the most concise and effective arrangement. This may involve breaking complex sentences into simpler ones or combining related ideas into a single sentence. 5. Edit and revise: Once you have drafted your brief sentence, take the time to carefully review and revise it, making further adjustments to improve clarity and conciseness. Here's an example of refining a sentence to make it more concise: Original sentence: \\"In order to achieve success in the field of business, it is of utmost importance that an individual must have excellent communication skills as well as possess the ability to work effectively with a team.\\" Revised (concise) sentence: \\"Successful business professionals require strong communication and teamwork abilities.\\" In conclusion, crafting a brief sentence involves focusing on the main point, utilizing precise language, eliminating wordiness, restructuring the sentence, and editing and revising for optimal clarity and conciseness.

Context: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"Based on the provided article, most commentators have considered suicide to be the more likely cause of Philip Heseltine's death. Heseltine, also known by his pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. He was found dead in his Chelsea flat on December 17, 1930, from apparent coal gas poisoning. During the inquest held on December 22, the jury could not conclusively determine whether Heseltine's death was accidental or suicide, and thus an open verdict was returned. Despite the open verdict, suicide is considered the more probable cause by most commentators for various reasons. For instance, Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and his partner, Barbara Peache, have both recalled him threatening to take his life by gas in the past. Furthermore, an outline of a new will was discovered among the papers in his flat, which could potentially indicate a premeditated decision to end his life. Another theory, proposed by Heseltine's son Nigel, suggests that his father was murdered by a certain Van Dieren, who was the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will and was supposedly going to be replaced if the new will were finalized. However, this theory is not considered plausible by most commentators. Additionally, it is worth noting that before turning on the lethal gas, Heseltine reportedly put his young cat outside of the room, which some argue further supports the suicide theory. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the article, most commentators believe that suicide is the more likely cause of Philip Heseltine's death."},{"instruction":"Sasha sent her son to college to further his education and learn.

The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system. - ELF Corporation ( or élf) was an eroge studio. One of its most popular games is \\"Dkysei\\", a pioneering dating sim, which has had a sequel, and been turned into video and TV series. The character design of the main villains from the \\"-saku\\" series is the company mascot. They are also known for role-playing video games such as the \\"Dragon Knight\\" series and visual novel adventure games such as \\"YU-NO\\". - Dragon Knight II (II) is a fantasy-themed eroge role-playing video game in the \\"Dragon Knight\\" franchise that was originally developed and published by ELF Corporation in 1990-1991 only in Japan as the first sequel to the original \\"Dragon Knight\\" from 1989. The game is an erotic dungeon crawler in which a young warrior Takeru fights to lift a witch's curse that has turned girls into monsters. - MSX is the name of a standardized home computer architecture, first announced by Microsoft on June 16, 1983, and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then Vice-president at Microsoft Japan and Director at ASCII Corporation. Microsoft conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various hardware makers of the period. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - An is a Japanese pornographic video game. History. Japanese eroge, also known as H-Light novels or hentai games, have their origins in the early 1980s, when Japanese companies introduced their own brands of microcomputer to compete with those of the United States. Competing systems included the Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7, MSX, and NEC PC-8801. NEC was behind its competitors in terms of hardware (with only 16 colors and no sound support) and needed a way to regain control of the market. Thus came the erotic game. The first commercial erotic computer game, \\"Night Life\\", was released by Koei in 1982. It was an early graphic adventure, with sexually explicit images. That same year, Koei released another erotic title, \\"Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku\\" (\\"Seduction of the Condominium Wife\\"), which was an early role-playing adventure game with colour graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the NEC PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - Koei Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game publisher, developer, and distributor founded in 1978. The company is known for its historical simulation games based on the novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", as well as simulation games based on pseudo-historical events. - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems. - Knights of Xentar is an eroge role - playing video game published for the PC DOS in North America by Megatech Software in 1995 and has been originally published as Dragon Knight III in Japan in 1991 . It is part of the Dragon Knight series of games created by Japanese game developer ELF , who originally released the game for the NEC PC - 8801 computer in 1991 , followed by ports for the Sharp X68000 and PC Engine CD platforms .

Dates have a naturally sticky texture due to their high sugar content (glucose and fructose). While this is one of the main reasons for their popularity, it can also make them challenging to work with. Here are some practical tips to avoid gummy dates: 1. Select high-quality dates: When purchasing dates, look for firm, plump, and shiny ones. The skin should not be broken or have any visible signs of mold. If the dates are packaged, make sure the container is airtight and properly sealed. 2. Store dates correctly: To maintain their texture and prevent them from becoming gummy, it is essential to store dates in a cool, dry, and dark place. You can keep them in an airtight container or plastic bag to protect them from humidity, heat, and air exposure. If you live in a hot and humid climate, consider storing dates in the refrigerator to extend their shelf life. 3. Cut the dates right before using: To prevent excessive sticking and gumminess, cut the dates just before incorporating them into your recipes. This will help maintain their texture and minimize the stickiness. 4. Dust with flour: If you're using dates in a baked item or mixing them with other ingredients, try lightly dusting them with a little bit of flour before cutting or blending. The flour will absorb some of their moisture and help prevent them from sticking together or becoming gummy. 5. Use a sharp knife or kitchen scissors: When chopping or cutting dates, use a sharp knife or kitchen scissors to make clean, smooth cuts. This will prevent the dates from getting squished or compressed, which can result in a gummy texture. 6. Oil your knife or scissors: To minimize sticking, lightly coat the blade of your knife or the blades of your scissors with cooking oil or non-stick cooking spray. This will help the dates slide off the blade more easily and reduce gumminess. 7. Pulse in a food processor: If you're using a food processor to chop or blend dates, pulse the machine in short bursts instead of continuously running it. This will help maintain the structure of the dates, preventing them from becoming over-processed and gummy. 8. Separate the dates: When layering or incorporating chopped dates into a recipe, gently separate any clumps of dates stuck together to ensure even distribution and minimize gumminess. 9. Rehydrate dry dates: If you're working with overly dry dates, rehydrate them by soaking in warm water or juice for about 10-15 minutes. Drain well and pat dry before using. This will revitalize their texture and make them less likely to become gummy. 10. Practice patience: When handling dates, it's essential to work gently and patiently. Avoid applying excessive pressure and take the time to separate sticky pieces if necessary. By following these tips, you will be better equipped to prevent dates from becoming gummy, ensuring your recipes turn out delicious with just the right texture."},{"instruction":"Review: Love it, love it, love it!

Its population is approximately 800,000 people. Aden's ancient, natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano which now forms a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a low isthmus. This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC. The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula. Aden gives its name to the Gulf of Aden. - The Horn of Africa (, \\"yäafrika qänd\\", \\"al-qarn al-'afrq\\") (shortened to HOA) is a peninsula in Northeast Africa. It juts hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. The area is the easternmost projection of the African continent. The Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. - Monsoon is traditionally defined as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation, but is now used to describe seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation associated with the asymmetric heating of land and sea. Usually, the term monsoon is used to refer to the rainy phase of a seasonally changing pattern, although technically there is also a dry phase. The term is sometimes incorrectly used for locally heavy but short-term rains, although these rains meet the dictionary definition of monsoon. - In geography, a plain is a flat area. Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains. - The term highland or uplands is used to denote any mountainous region or elevated mountainous plateau. Generally speaking, upland (or uplands) tends to refer to ranges of hills, typically up to 500-600 m. Highland (or highlands) is usually reserved for ranges of low mountains. - The Gulf of Aden (\\"\\") is a gulf located in the Arabian Sea between Yemen, on the south coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and Somalia in the Horn of Africa.

He was born with spina bifida, for which he had corrective surgery as an infant. Mellencamp formed his first band, Crepe Soul, at the age of 14 and later played in the local bands Trash, Snakepit Banana Barn and the Mason Brothers. When Mellencamp was 18, he eloped with his pregnant girlfriend Priscilla Esterline. Country music star Keith Urban has consistently cited Mellencamp's influence on his music. It originated when Mellencamp's Lonesome Jubilee tour went to Australia in 1988; Urban was in attendance at one of the concerts and described the experience as an \\"epiphany.\\" \\"'I Need A Lover' and 'Hurts So Good' were massive hits in Australia\\", Urban told the Vancouver Sun in 2016. \\"I played so many of those songs in my cover bands. But for me, The Lonesome Jubilee was the defining record and tour. I've since gotten to know John a little bit and it was one of the greatest opportunities I've ever had to meet a hero and tell him about a concert you went to when you were a nobody and how much of an effect that concert had on me. \\"I just remember that moment: Here's that full-on rock section, with Kenny Aronoff on drums and Larry Crane a rock guitarist with swagger. But there was also Lisa Germano on fiddle, they had an accordion player, there was an acoustic guitarist. I was hit by lightning by that concert. I said to John, 'I didn't walk away thinking: I want to do that. I walked away feeling: I get it -- just put all the things you love into what you do.' It was singularly the most important concert I've ever been to in my life because it showed me the way.\\" Urban went into more detail on the impact Mellencamp's Lonesome Jubilee Tour concert had on him when CMT asked him about the concert that most influenced him: \\"The most impactful one for me was probably John Mellencamp in '88 or '89 on the Lonesome Jubilee Tour. It was singularly the most epiphany experience I'd ever had at a concert. Prior to that, from the age of 6 or 7, I was somewhere in between Top 40, country and, 'Who the hell am I and what do I do?' But The Lonesome Jubilee came out. I loved 'Paper in Fire' and 'Check It Out' because it was such a melting pot of things. But when I went to see him live, his band was so phenomenally good. Great, great band. And I remember watching the concert - and the light went off. There's a rock rhythm section, but there's acoustic guitar, electric guitar. This fiddle, this accordion. He's singing these rural lyrics, but he's got swagger and attitude for days. It was like everything came together. I got to talk to John years later, and I said to him how much that concert changed my life. I didn't leave that concert thinking 'I want to be Mellencamp.' I went away going, 'Take all of your influences and make your own thing.' It was such a liberating experience for me.\\" Urban has covered numerous Mellencamp songs in his concerts over the years, including \\"Hurts So Good\\", \\"Jack and Diane\\", \\"Authority Song\\", and \\"Rumbleseat\\". In 2015, Urban and Mellencamp performed \\"Pink Houses\\" together twice during nationally televised events. Urban's 2015 hit single \\"John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16\\" further illustrated Mellencamp's influence on his music. Why was it defining","output":"The Lonesome Jubilee Tour concert by John Mellencamp was a defining moment for Keith Urban for several reasons: 1. Appreciation for its musical blend: Keith Urban found the mix of instruments and musical styles played during Mellencamp's concert to be incredibly enlightening. The rock rhythm section, the acoustic guitar, electric guitar, fiddle, and accordion, all together created a unique, compelling sound that deeply affected Urban. 2. Epiphany regarding personal style: Urban didn't walk away from the concert wanting to emulate Mellencamp. Instead, the concert gave him an epiphany about taking all the musical influences he loved and creating his own unique style. It guided him to adopt an eclectic music style incorporating all the elements he loved. 3. Impact on Urban's own music: The concert greatly impacted Urban's own approach to music. Mellencamp's blend of rural lyrics with rock and roll swagger showed Urban a new way to approach his music, one that he would carry forward throughout his career. Urban has covered numerous Mellencamp songs in his concerts over the years, driven by the influence that Mellencamp has had on his music. 4. Personal connection: Urban also got to know Mellencamp personally, reinforcing the impact that Mellencamp's music had on him. This was further evidenced by Urban highlighting Mellencamp's influence in his 2015 hit single \\"John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16\\". In summary, the concert served as a crucial turning point in Urban's musical journey which helped him embrace his unique musical identity. It provided both musical inspiration and a template for creating his own individualised path in music, making it a truly defining moment for him."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: \\"Older white male in a pig'n' whistle white t-shirt polishes his sunglasses while looking at traffic.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"A man polishes his sunglasses while looking at the beach.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?

Question: suppose Predator tries to eat more eggs happens, how will it affect LESS birds. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"If a predator tries to eat more eggs, it will result in fewer birds. The increase in predation will reduce the number of eggs that hatch and survive, which directly affects the second effect mentioned, which is the incubation of eggs by the parent(s). This increased predation would have a negative impact on the bird population, as fewer eggs will survive to hatch, reducing the number of baby birds that can be taken care of by the mother and/or father. Consequently, fewer baby birds will grow up, develop flight feathers, learn to fly, leave the nest, and eventually find mates and mate themselves. As mentioned, the increased predation influences the second effect by causing fewer birds, specifically leading to less successful incubation of the eggs by the parent(s) due to the reduced number of eggs that are able to hatch and survive."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: In modern color theory, also known as the RGB color model, red, green and blue are additive primary colors.

These are two of the additive primary colors in the RGB color model."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Kidneys The kidneys participate in several complex endocrine pathways and produce certain hormones. A decline in blood flow to the kidneys stimulates them to release the enzyme renin, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system, and stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water. The reabsorption increases blood flow and blood pressure. The kidneys also play a role in regulating blood calcium levels through the production of calcitriol from vitamin D3, which is released in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In addition, the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in response to low oxygen levels. EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone marrow, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. You may have heard of EPO as a performance-enhancing drug (in a synthetic form).

Choices: - thyroids - kidneys - lungs - kidneys A: The answer is:","output":"- kidneys"},{"instruction":"This is some data: Alhambra, owner, P&O (company); Alhambra, powerType, Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes; Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes, location, Deptford; Alhambra, builder, Samuda Brothers. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"Based on the given data, the Alhambra is a maritime vessel that is owned by the P&O company. The P&O company, which stands for Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, is a British shipping and logistics enterprise. Established in the early 19th century, P&O has a rich history and played a significant part in the growth of maritime transportation globally. The Alhambra is powered by a system devised by Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes. Power generation systems for a ship may include diesel engines, steam turbines, or gas turbines, among others. Specific details about the power generation system by Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes are not provided; however, the inclusion of their names suggests that it is a unique or notable configuration, possibly a custom or specialized design for the Alhambra. The company Humphrys, Tennant, and Dykes is located in Deptford, a district in South East London, England. Deptford has a long-standing association with the British Royal Navy and maritime activities since the time of Henry VIII. Operating from this historic location, Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes likely have access to specialized knowledge and resources, which may have influenced their work on the Alhambra's power system. Another piece of information about the Alhambra is that it was built by the Samuda Brothers. This indicates that the vessel was constructed by a renowned shipbuilding firm, which might have had a strong reputation for producing quality ships. The Samuda Brothers were a prominent shipbuilding company during the 19th century, operating out of the Isle of Dogs in East London. Founded by brothers Joseph d'Aguilar Samuda and Jacob Samuda, the company notably constructed several iron steamships and had a significant impact on the advancement of shipbuilding technology during their time. In summary, the Alhambra is a maritime vessel owned by the P&O company, featuring a power system designed by Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes. The vessel was constructed by the Samuda Brothers, a prominent shipbuilding company in the 19th century, and the power system company Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes is located in the historically significant maritime district of Deptford. From this data, we can infer that the Alhambra is a well-crafted vessel resulting from the collaboration between accomplished engineers and shipbuilders."},{"instruction":"Information: - A court painter was an artist who painted for the members of a royal or noble family, sometimes on a fixed salary and on an exclusive basis where the artist was not supposed to undertake other work. Especially in the late Middle Ages, they were often given the office of valet de chambre. Usually they were given a salary and formal title, and often a pension for life, though arrangements were highly variable. For the artist, a court appointment had the advantage of freeing them from the restriction of local painters' guilds, although in the Middle Ages and Renaissance they also often had to spend large amounts of time doing decorative work about the palace, and creating temporary works for court entertainments and displays. In England the role of Serjeant Painter was set up for this, leaving the \\"King's painter\\" (and the queen's) free to paint mostly portraits. See category of \\"Italian art collectors\\" for lists that included non-aristocratic patrons. Some artists, like Jan van Eyck or Diego Velázquez, were used in other capacities at court, as diplomats, functionaries, or administrators. - The Northern Renaissance was the Renaissance that occurred in Europe north of the Alps. Before 1497, Italian Renaissance humanism had little influence outside Italy. From the late 15th century, its ideas spread around Europe. This influenced the German Renaissance, French Renaissance, English Renaissance, Renaissance in the Low Countries, Polish Renaissance and other national and localized movements, each with different characteristics and strengths. - Lucas Cranach the Younger (\\"Lucas Cranach der Jüngere\\"; 4 October 1515 25 January 1586) was a German Renaissance painter and portraitist, also known as the son of Lucas Cranach the Elder. - Matthias Grünewald ( 31 August 1528) was a German Renaissance painter of religious works who ignored Renaissance classicism to continue the style of late medieval Central European art into the 16th century. His first name is also given as Mathis and his surname as Gothart or Neithardt. Only ten paintingsseveral consisting of many panelsand thirty-five drawings survive, all religious, although many others were lost at sea in the Baltic on their way to Sweden as war booty. His reputation was obscured until the late nineteenth century, and many of his paintings were attributed to Albrecht Dürer, who is now seen as his stylistic antithesis. His largest and most famous work is the Isenheim Altarpiece created 1506 to 1515 or perhaps 1512 to 1516. - The German Renaissance, part of the Northern Renaissance, was a cultural and artistic movement that spread among German thinkers in the 15th and 16th centuries, which developed from the Italian Renaissance. Many areas of the arts and sciences were influenced, notably by the spread of Renaissance humanism to the various German states and principalities. There were many advances made in the fields of architecture, the arts, and the sciences. Germany produced two developments that were to dominate the 16th century all over Europe: printing and the Protestant Reformation. - Lucas Cranach the Elder (\\"Lucas Cranach der Ältere\\" , c. 1472 16 October 1553) was a German Renaissance painter and printmaker in woodcut and engraving. He was court painter to the Electors of Saxony for most of his career, and is known for his portraits, both of German princes and those of the leaders of the Protestant Reformation, whose cause he embraced with enthusiasm, becoming a close friend of Martin Luther. He also painted religious subjects, first in the Catholic tradition, and later trying to find new ways of conveying Lutheran religious concerns in art. He continued throughout his career to paint nude subjects drawn from mythology and religion. He had a large workshop and many works exist in different versions; his son Lucas Cranach the Younger, and others, continued to create versions of his father's works for decades after his death. Lucas Cranach the Elder has been considered the most successful German artist of his time. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - Albrecht Altdorfer ( c. 1480 -- February 12 , 1538 ) was a German painter , engraver and architect of the Renaissance working in Regensburg . Along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Wolf Huber he is regarded to be the main representative of the so - called Danube School setting biblical and historical subjects against landscape backgrounds of expressive colours . As an artist also making small intricate engravings he is seen to belong to the Nuremberg Little Masters . - The Danube School or Donau School (German: \\"Donauschule\\" or \\"Donaustil\\") was a circle of painters of the first third of the 16th century in Bavaria and Austria (mainly along the Danube valley). Many also were innovative printmakers, usually in etching. They were among the first painters to regularly use pure landscape painting, and their figures, influenced by Matthias Grünewald, are often highly expressive, if not expressionist. They show little Italian influence, and also represent a decisive break with the high finish of Northern Renaissance painting, using a more painterly style that was in many ways ahead of its time.

I disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described *Guns, Germs and Steel* as \\"politically correct\\" and \\"neo-Marxist.\\" They cannot have watched the same series that *I* did. The series *I* watched depicted the history of European colonisation in the Americas and southern Africa with no particular inaccuracies. I saw nothing in the series that portrayed Europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky, though Europeans often *were* lucky - and there's nothing wrong with luck. Neither did I see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things. If anything, the Inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners, if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power.

Despite his diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s. His 1930 season with the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season hitting performances in baseball history. Highlights included 56 home runs, the National League record for 68 years; and 191 runs batted in, a mark yet to be surpassed. \\" Wilson made his major league debut with the Giants on September 29, 1923 and became the starting left fielder the following season. By mid-July he was ranked second in the National League (NL) in hitting. He ended the season with a .295 average, 10 home runs, and 57 runs batted in (RBIs) as New York won the NL pennant. In the 1924 World Series he averaged only .233 in a seven-game loss to the Washington Senators. Multiple stories exist to explain the origin of Wilson's nickname: By one account, a New York newspaper held a nicknaming contest; the winning entry was \\"Hack\\" because he reminded many fans of another stocky athlete, the popular wrestler Georg Hackenschmidt. In another version, McGraw is said to have remarked that Wilson's physique was reminiscent of a \\"hack\\" (slang for taxicab in that era). Giants teammate Bill Cunningham claimed that the nickname was based on Wilson's resemblance to Hack Miller, an outfielder with the Chicago Cubs. The New York Times printed the first documented usage of \\"Hack\\" on June 10, 1924. Early in the 1925 season Wilson hit the longest home run on record at Ebbets Field against the Brooklyn Robins, but fell into a slump in May, and was replaced in left field by Irish Meusel. On July 2 he hit two home runs in one inning, tying Ken Williams' major league record set in 1922, but his hitting slump continued. In August McGraw told reporters that he had \\"...made the mistake of rushing [Wilson] along,\\" and sent him to the Giants' minor league affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. At season's end, a front office oversight--or possibly, deliberate inaction--left him unprotected on the Toledo roster, and the last-place Chicago Cubs acquired him on waivers. \\"They let go the best outfielder I ever played alongside\\", said Giants right fielder Ross Youngs, \\"and they're going to regret it.\\" During the 1925 World Series -- between the Senators and the Pittsburgh Pirates -- Wilson's son, Robert, was born. Was he a good fielder","output":"Hack Wilson was an amazing baseball player, but when it comes to fielding, he wasn't the best. His main strength was hitting the ball with power, and he was known for being a great hitter. While he did play positions in the outfield, like left fielder, his fielding skills were not as impressive as his hitting abilities. So, you can say that he was an okay fielder, but what made him famous was his strong skills in hitting the ball and scoring home runs and runs batted in."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: It was Putin's third trophy. \\"Don't be surprised if you see my balls time and time again\\" The World Cup is over for another four years.

Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. This hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago, The Fairmont was among the classiest brands. No more. My 29th floor room was expansive, but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. The upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. Worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. It was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. Other reviewers remarked that this hotel \\"needs updating,\\" but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame. For instance, someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. I couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (I am not unusually tall.)

Consider age, health, and location of potential agents. Consider the agent's religion and lifestyle preferences.","output":"Title: Choosing the Ideal Trust Agent: What to Consider Introduction In life, it is crucial to have someone you can trust to act on your behalf, make decisions for you, or share sensitive information with, especially during critical moments. This person, known as a trust agent, must possess certain characteristics and share similar values with you. Selecting the perfect trust agent requires profound consideration. This article presents a guide on factors to consider when choosing a trust agent, including age, health, location, religion, and lifestyle preferences. 1. Age of Your Trust Agent The first aspect to consider when choosing a trust agent is their age. Understandably, a younger person might be more agile and innovative, while an older individual might possess more experience and wisdom. Therefore, it is important to weigh these factors and choose an age range that best suits your needs and expectations. Try to select someone who not only possesses maturity but also has the potential to adapt to future changes. 2. Health of Your Trust Agent In addition to age, the health of your potential trust agent is another critical factor. Your trust agent must be physically and mentally able to handle any responsibilities and tasks assigned to them. An individual with good health will have fewer limitations in making decisions and fulfilling their role effectively. It is important to have an honest conversation about their health status, ensuring that they are committed to the long-term responsibilities of being a trust agent. 3. Location of Your Trust Agent Geographical proximity can impact the efficiency and effectiveness of a trust agent. Ideally, your trust agent should be located within accessible distance, allowing prompt communication and decision-making when necessary. In cases where long-distance communication is unavoidable, it is essential to establish a dependable line of communication, either through phone calls, emails or video conferences. 4. Religion and Cultural Background of Your Trust Agent Religion and cultural background play an essential role in shaping a person's values, beliefs, and decision-making process. It is crucial to choose a trust agent who shares your religious and cultural values to ensure that the decisions made on your behalf align with your beliefs. Discussing significant religious or cultural practices relevant to you and your trust agent will help create a strong foundation for a successful, understanding partnership. 5. Lifestyle Preferences of Your Trust Agent Finally, lifestyle preferences should be taken into consideration when selecting an ideal trust agent. These preferences include factors such as their personal habits, hobbies, financial management, and professional endeavors. By selecting someone with similar lifestyle preferences, you ensure they can understand and address your concerns with empathy and familiarity. This congruence of preferences will enable your trust agent to make decisions that genuinely reflect your desired outcomes. Conclusion Selecting the right trust agent is a process that involves an evaluation of age, health, location, religion, cultural background, and lifestyle preferences. By carefully considering these factors, you can identify the ideal individual who will diligently and faithfully perform their role on your behalf. Remember that honest and open communication is key for establishing mutual understanding and trust between you and your chosen trust agent."},{"instruction":"Student: If \\"A man cutting a piece pf paper.\\" does that mean that \\"A woman is cutting material for a dress.\\"?

After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink. His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges.

The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella.

The Solomon Islands is a group of islands located in the South Pacific Ocean, east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu. It is part of a region known as Melanesia, which also includes Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and New Caledonia. The country is made up of nearly 1,000 islands, 347 of which are inhabited, and covers a total area of approximately 28,400 square kilometers. The islands are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, a zone of heightened volcanic and seismic activity that encircles the Pacific Ocean and is home to 90% of the world's earthquakes and 75% of the world's volcanoes. This makes the Solomon Islands an area rich in volcanic activity. There are 11 confirmed active volcanoes on the Solomon Islands. They include: 1. Simbo: A complex of closely-spaced volcanic cones, including two main peaks – Ove and Matangi. The most recent eruption occurred in 1950. 2. Kana Keoki: Located on the western half of Ranongga Island, it is an underwater volcano that last erupted in 1957. 3. Kolombangara: A dormant volcano with a summit at 1,800 meters above sea level. 4. Tinakula: Located in the Santa Cruz Islands, it is an active, stratovolcano with frequent eruptions recorded since the 16th century. Tinakula's last eruption was in 2018. 5. Savo: A stratovolcano located on the island of the same name. It has not experienced a confirmed eruption since the 19th century, but its fumarolic activity indicates that it is still volcanic. 6. Bagana: An active cone-shaped volcano, its eruptions have been recorded since 1842, with the most recent one happening in 2017. 7. Balbi: A central mountain peak on Bougainville Island, it is active but dormant, with the most recent eruption in the early 20th century. These volcanoes contribute to the geological and ecological diversity of the Solomon Islands. The volcanic islands have fertile soil that supports lush tropical rainforests and allows for agricultural cultivation. The volcanoes also contribute to the formation of new islands and help shape the landscape through processes like erosion and lava flow deposition. Apart from being geologically significant, the Solomon Islands provide a unique melting pot of cultural and biological diversity. It is home to over 90 distinct languages and 5,000 plant species; roughly 76% of those plant species are endemic to the islands. The lush rainforests and rich marine biodiversity make the Solomon Islands an ecological treasure. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Вулканы Соломоновых Островов\\" translates to \\"Volcanoes of the Solomon Islands\\" in English. The Solomon Islands is a volcanic-rich region located in Melanesia, and it is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. The country boasts 11 confirmed active volcanoes, contributing to the geological, ecological, and cultural diversity of the islands."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: In order to comply with this obligation, the depositary shall: Czech:","output":"Aby splnil tuto povinnost, depozitář musí:"},{"instruction":"Thecelebrityofthisyear’sawardshowisnotquiteinplace.

At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him.

Securely fastened with bland tropes, low-grade dialogue, and cringe-worthy performances, this film comprises a train-wreck of storytelling haphazardly held together with the hope that its enchanting premise could redeem it. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. Upon entering the theater, I held high expectations for “Timeless Tragedy,” given the glowing pre-release hype and the on-paper potential for a gripping sci-fi thriller. The premise was simple: A father and son duo, Alex and Jimmy, discover a time-travel device, accidentally embarking on a whirlwind adventure to get back to their original timeline. Yet, even with this alluring foundation, the film immediately falls flat on its face with the onset of the first act. At the heart of any respectable film is the narrative. Unfortunately, it's clear that the writing team has thoroughly missed the mark, delivering a clichéd and half-baked script that drags its viewers through a painful descent into monotony. The dialogue appears to have been entirely assembled from a second-hand cardboard box, filled with worn-out trope-laden lines and predictable plot devices. The audience is force-fed inane banter alongside the characters' supposed development, ultimately rendering the heroes flat and profoundly one-dimensional. The film’s protagonists, our beloved time-traveling father and son duo, lack the complexity and motivation required for viewers to invest in their journey. Alex, played by Bryan Henderson, is a generic scientist dad who struggles to relate to his son, while James Roberts delivers an equally pedestrian performance as teen rebel Jimmy. The duo's chemistry is non-existent, as their banal interactions squander the opportunity to portray a genuine bond between these familial actors. Frequently teetering on the edge of groan-worthy and entirely forgettable, their dialogue poorly serves their already-struggling performances. Adding insult to injury, these tired tropes are not only present within the main cast but frequent the entire film. One-dimensional antagonists seem to multiply tenfold as the plot thickens, demonstrating the shallow imagination of the creative team who could have taken this opportunity to expand on fascinating themes of historical manipulation or dystopian geopolitics. Visually, the film attempts to cheat its way into the audience's good graces. While some scenes boast dazzling visual effects reflective of today's CGI-driven cinematic climate, these shallow tricks cannot swindle their way into redeeming the lackluster story at hand. Egregiously transparent attempts at topping up the film's “wow” factor are solely hampered by the plot holes that an elephant could step through and the time-travel devices that we now collectively roll our eyes at. As I exited the theater, still digesting the less-than-appetizing slog I had just endured, I couldn't help but think of how many hours I had invested in this wretched production. I pondered the thousands of other possibilities that awaited me in a world filled with more gripping and altogether superior material. In the end, while “Timeless Tragedy” tries desperately to stand out in the crowded world of science-fiction filmography, it ultimately can't escape its own flawed self. In an attempt to dazzle its audience with shiny bells and whistles, it instead leaves you feeling empty, bewildered, and utterly exhausted."},{"instruction":"Background: Manic Street Preachers are a Welsh rock band, formed in 1986 in Blackwood, Caerphilly and consisting of James Dean Bradfield (lead vocals, lead guitar), Nicky Wire (bass guitar, lyrics) and Sean Moore (drums, percussion, soundscapes). They are often colloquially known as the Manics. Following the release of their first single, \\"Suicide Alley\\", the band was joined by Richey Edwards as co-lyricist and rhythm guitarist. The band's early albums were in a punk vein, eventually broadening to a greater alternative rock sound, whilst retaining a leftist politicisation. Context: In late 2005, both Bradfield and Wire announced that they intended to release solo material prior to a new album by the band. A free download of Nicky Wire's debut solo offering I Killed the Zeitgeist was posted on the band's website for just one day, Christmas Day 2005, while \\"The Shining Path\\" was released exclusively on iTunes for download. In addition, a promotional album sampler had been sent out to the press and certain other people which included \\"I Killed the Zeitgeist\\", \\"Goodbye Suicide\\", \\"Sehnsucht\\", and \\"Everything Fades\\". The album was officially released in September 2006. It charted at No. 130 in the UK. The sound of the album, which Nicky referred to as his \\"nihilistic anti-everything album\\", was inspired by, among others, Neu!, the Plastic Ono Band, Einsturzende Neubauten, the Modern Lovers, Richard Thompson and Lou Reed. Only one official single was released, \\"Break My Heart Slowly\\", which charted at No. 74. Nicky toured small intimate venues across the UK with his band the Secret Society. Bradfield's solo album, The Great Western, was released in July 2006, to positive reviews from critics. It reached No. 22 in the UK. The sound of the album was inspired by, among others, Jeff Beck, Badfinger, Simple Minds and McCarthy. Two singles were released: \\"That's No Way to Tell a Lie\\" (No. 18) in July, which was also the background music to the BBC's Match of the Day's 'Goal of the Month' competition, and then \\"An English Gentleman\\" (No. 31) in September. The latter is in remembrance of the first Manics manager Philip Hall, to whom The Holy Bible had been dedicated. The initial pressings of the red 7\\" single were actually made with black vinyl, some of which were sent out to distributors by mistake. James toured the album with a band that included Wayne Murray, who would subsequently play second guitar for Manics live performances. James' solo gigs featured covers of the Clash songs \\"Clampdown\\" and \\"The Card Cheat\\", both from the album London Calling. In a later interview, when the band were collectively asked what they had learned from making a solo album, Sean Moore dryly quipped \\"Not to do one\\".

The factors contributing to this correlation include: 1. Energy intake: Bees primarily forage on flowers for nectar, which is their primary source of energy for wax production. When there is an abundance of food or more flowers in their environment, they have easier access to the nectar they need for energy. This, in turn, fuels their wax production. 2. Efficient foraging: Access to a larger quantity of food leads to the bees spending less time and energy searching for nectar-bearing flowers, allowing them to dedicate more time and resources to other hive-related activities such as producing wax and honey. 3. Hive expansion: The greater the availability of food, the more rapidly the colony can grow. A larger bee population will require an increase in hive size, which necessitates the production of more wax for construction purposes. Worker bees are responsible for secreting wax scales and constructing new honeycombs to accommodate the growth of the colony. 4. Increased honey production: As more food is available, bees can collect and process more nectar to make honey. In order to store the honey, honeycombs made of beeswax are needed, which prompts the bees to produce more wax. 5. Brood growth: A consequence of increased food availability is an increase in brood (young bees). An expanding brood requires additional space in the hive in the form of cells built using beeswax, leading to increased wax production. 6. Improved health and well-being: Ample food availability supports a more robust immune system and the overall health of individual bees. Healthy bees are more capable of producing wax, contributing to a more structurally sound and maintained hive. 7. Supporting colony functions: An abundance of food maintains colony cohesion and efficiency, allowing bees to maintain their various tasks effectively, which includes wax production. In conclusion, the answer is A: more wax will be created. When more food is available for bees, it has a positive effect on their energy intake, enables efficient foraging, and supports the overall growth and well-being of the colony. This, in turn, translates to an increased need for expansion and storage, which triggers the increased production of beeswax by the worker bees within the colony."},{"instruction":"This is a correct answer to the following question about List of Presidents of the United States.

The \\"ability of a system to perform work\\" is a common description, but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms.

Common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature. All of the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy.

The two-day meeting of FIFA's executive committee in Zurich will also consider allegations that migrant workers employed on huge World Cup-related construction projects are being abused. Dozens of workers' rights protesters, waving flags and brandishing red cards, gathered outside the complex ahead of the meeting as they delivered a letter to FIFA President Sepp Blatter calling on soccer's world governing body to ensure fair labor practices. A FIFA official took the letter inside, saying that FIFA is taking the matter seriously. Members of the executive committee, known as ExCo, declined to answer reporters' questions as they entered. In addition to the issues of Qatar's summer heat and concerns over labor conditions, the committee is expected to hear an update from Qatar 2022 organizers on their preparations for the World Cup. FIFA has been considering the option of moving the tournament because of fears that players and fans could be adversely affected by temperatures that sometimes reach 122 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer. All 54 member associations of UEFA, Europe's governing body, last month voted against holding the tournament in the Qatari summer, adding to speculation that a move to the winter was in prospect. But a winter World Cup would cause chaos with the European domestic season, with many clubs fearing they could lose out financially. Decision, or no decision? The final decision lies with FIFA's executive committee. Its verdict had been widely expected to come Friday -- but UEFA President Michel Platini has reportedly cast doubt on that. \\"There will be no decision. It is impossible,\\" he is quoted by Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper as saying Wednesday in Zurich. Platini reportedly added that he was \\"much more concerned\\" by the allegations of abusive labor practices in Qatar than the question of when the tournament is played. FIFA said last week that it would raise the issue of workers' rights with the Qatari authorities and that the executive committee would discuss claims that migrant workers are being exploited. A CNN report in May highlighted allegations by rights groups that thousands of construction workers building the infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup have been abused, denied their wages and trapped in a situation from which they cannot escape because, under Qatar's visa system, they cannot leave the country without their employer's consent. Allegations made by The Guardian newspaper last week added to concerns. The world professional footballers association, FIFPro, said that \\"Qatar must respect the rights of the key people who will deliver the 2022 FIFA World Cup: the workers who build the World Cup stadia and infrastructure and the professional footballers who play in them.\\" The Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee has said it is committed to ensuring workers' safety and well being. Labor ministry: More inspectors, translators. Ali Al Khulaifi, an international relations adviser at Qatar's Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, told CNN that Qatar is taking concrete steps to ensure its labor rules are enforced, including making it easier for workers to report abuses by their employers. \\"We have a plan to double the number of inspectors by the end of the year,\\" he said. \\"Since many of the migrant workers don't speak Arabic, we are hiring translators to submit complaints.\\" The Ministry of Labor says it plans to increase the number of branches it has from the current two in the capital, Doha, and five outside, but has not given details. Conditions for workers in Qatar have come under increased scrutiny since a report in The Guardian last week alleging that dozens of Nepali migrant laborers died there over the summer. \\"We are a member of the ILO (International Labour Organization). We have ratified the forced labor convention. So we're hiring an international firm to look into the allegations,\\" Al Khulaifi said. \\"Work-related deaths are really unfortunate. But the numbers are less than what was published.\\" He said the ministry would investigate any claims that some companies are holding the passports of workers, preventing them from leaving, as has been alleged. The ministry has commissioned an international law firm, DLA Piper, to carry out independent investigation into the allegations and report back to the government, the state-run Qatar News Agency reported Wednesday. Legal action threatened. The question of any shift in the calendar for the 2022 Qatar World Cup -- or, more drastically, any move to take it away from the wealthy Gulf nation -- will be closely watched around the world. Australia, which lost out to Qatar along with South Korea, the United States and Japan, believes it should be compensated if the World Cup is held in the winter rather than the summer and has threatened legal action. A move to the winter months could also have big cost implications for European clubs and for broadcasters. Moving matches means shifting many of the events that the latter have paid multimillions for and, importantly, would be wanting to tie up in contracts for the future. Blatter, the FIFA president, recently said that it would not be feasible to hold a summer World Cup in Qatar. But Qatar disagrees. Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee, told CNN last week that it is \\"absolutely not\\" too hot during the summer to stage the tournament then. He acknowledged that summer in his country is hot, but said, \\"Other nations have hosted similar World Cups in similar if not more severe conditions.\\" In addition, he said, Qatar is investing in cooling technologies for stadiums, training areas and fan areas. This, he said, \\"adds more confidence to us in terms of our ability to host a very successful and very memorable World Cup.\\" CNN's Alex Thomas reported from Zurich and Leone Lakhani from Doha, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Schams Elwazer contributed to this report.","output":"- FIFA officials meet in Switzerland to discuss the possibility of changing the dates of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar due to concerns over extreme heat during the summer months. - Worker's rights protesters gather outside of the meeting, calling for FIFA to ensure fair labor practices amidst allegations of migrant worker abuse in World Cup-related construction projects. - UEFA, Europe's governing body, has voted against holding the tournament in the Qatari summer, raising speculation for a possible winter World Cup, which could lead to scheduling chaos and financial loss for European football clubs. - FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that a summer World Cup in Qatar might not be feasible, while Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee secretary general Hassan al-Thawadi argued that it is not too hot and that cooling technologies for stadiums, training and fan areas will be implemented. - Labor practices and conditions in Qatar are under scrutiny after allegations of abusive working conditions have surfaced, leading the Ministry of Labor to make efforts to increase inspectors, translators, and branches to monitor and enforce labor rules."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: How to optimize a press release<br>Decide the overall goal of the press release.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The scenario of a big party happening can indirectly impact a step of the rust formation process. To understand how a big party could affect rust formation, let's break down the situation: A large gathering of people can lead to many factors that could indirectly influence the rust formation process. Here are some possible factors and their indirect impacts: 1. Increased heat and humidity: A large number of people in one area can generate more heat and humidity. Higher humidity levels may lead to more condensation and moisture on iron surfaces, potentially accelerating the rust formation process. 2. Movement and physical contact: During a party, people might inadvertently bump into or touch iron objects, removing protective coatings or introducing contaminants that could facilitate rusting. 3. Spills and stains: Food and beverages can be spilled during parties, leading to substances contacting iron surfaces. Certain substances, like acidic juices or sauces, could potentially speed up the rusting process by providing additional acidic compounds that contribute to rust formation. Taking these factors into account, a big party happening could indirectly impact a step of the rust formation process by creating environmental conditions more conducive to rusting or by altering the surface of the iron object. The presence of a large number of people might bring forth higher levels of moisture, physical contact, and substances that can influence the rust formation process compared to a pristine environment. However, it's important to note that these factors do not directly modify the rust formation steps themselves; instead, they affect conditions in which the process unfolds."},{"instruction":"First question: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to Colombia's? Second question: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to that of other countries? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let us address the two questions you've asked. Question 1: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to Colombia's? Question 2: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to that of other countries? While both questions focus on Bolivia's unique geographical location, the first question specifically seeks a comparison with Colombia, whereas the second question is open to comparison with any country. Thus, although similar in intent, these questions are not exactly the same. Now, let's provide detailed answers to both questions. Question 1: Bolivia's geographical location is unique in the region for several reasons. Located in western-central South America, Bolivia is a landlocked country, bordered by Brazil to the north and east, Paraguay and Argentina to the south, and Chile and Peru to the west. In contrast to other South American nations, Bolivia lacks direct access to the ocean, which has had a profound impact on the country's development, trade, and relations with neighboring countries. Bolivia's geography can primarily be divided into three regions: the Andean region, which includes the Altiplano plateau and the Cordillera mountain ranges; the Sub-Andean region or Yungas, which is a transition zone between the Altiplano and the Amazon rainforest; and the Llanos, or lowlands, which consist of the Gran Chaco and the Amazon Basin. Comparing Bolivia's geography to Colombia's, several differences stand out. Colombia is located in the northwest of South America, with coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Its geography is characterized by four main regions: the Andean highlands, the Caribbean coastal lowlands, the Pacific coastal lowlands, and the Eastern Llanos. While both countries share the Andean mountain range, Bolivia's Altiplano plateau is unique, being the world's second-highest plateau after Tibet. Additionally, Colombia experiences greater biodiversity due to its two coastlines and the country's proximity to the equator. Question 2: To address how Bolivia's geographical location is unique in the region and how its geography compares to that of other countries, we'll focus on two key aspects: its landlocked nature and its diverse topography. As mentioned earlier, Bolivia is a landlocked country, one of only two in South America (the other being Paraguay). This absence of a coastline presents distinct economic challenges and makes the country more reliant on its neighbors for maritime access. Around the world, other landlocked countries, such as Austria, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, or Uganda, face similar issues. Each of these countries has its own distinct topography and geopolitical situation, which, combined with their lack of coastline, contributes to the uniqueness of their geography. In terms of diverse topography, Bolivia boasts an array of distinct environments, including high plateaus, mountain ranges, and lowland plains. This broad spectrum is exemplary of the diversity seen in other geographically diverse countries—such as the United States, which spans arid deserts, towering mountains, fertile plains, and vast coastlines, or India, with its range of landscapes that stretch from the Himalayan peaks to tropical forests and coastal regions. In conclusion, while the two questions are similar in theme, they ask for different comparisons. Bolivia's geography has several unique features, notably its landlocked position and diverse landscapes. When comparing Bolivia to Colombia or other geographically diverse countries around the world, these unique aspects help to highlight the country's distinct position within South America and globally."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - Hamelin (or ; German: \\"Hameln\\") is a town on the river Weser in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the capital of the district of Hamelin-Pyrmont and has a population of roughly 56,000. Hamelin is best known for the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. - Josef Kramer ( 10 November 1906 -- 13 December 1945 ) was the Commandant of the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp . Dubbed \`\` The Beast of Belsen '' by camp inmates , he was a notorious German Nazi war criminal , directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of people . He was detained by the British army after the Second World War , convicted of war crimes and hanged on the gallows in Hamelin prison by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint . - Commandant (or ) is a title often given to the officer in charge of a military (or other uniformed service) training establishment or academy. This usage is common in English-speaking nations. In some countries it may be a military or police rank. It is also often used to refer to the commander of a military prison or prison camp (including concentration camps and prisoner of war camps). - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Pied Piper of Hamelin (also known as the Pan Piper, the Rat-Catcher of Hamelin) is the subject character of a legend from the town of Hamelin (Hameln), Lower Saxony, Germany. The legend dates back to the Middle Ages, the earliest references describing a piper, dressed in multicolored (\\"pied\\") clothing, who was a rat-catcher hired by the town to lure rats away with his magic pipe. When the citizens refuse to pay for this service, he retaliates by using his instrument's magical power on their children, leading them away as he had the rats. This version of the story spread as folklore and has appeared in the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning, among others. - To be hanged, drawn and quartered was from 1351 a statutory penalty in England for men convicted of high treason, although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of King Henry III (12161272). Convicts were fastened to a hurdle, or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where they were hanged (almost to the point of death), emasculated, disembowelled, beheaded and quartered (chopped into four pieces). Their remains were often displayed in prominent places across the country, such as London Bridge. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead burned at the stake. - The Weser is a river in Northwestern Germany. Formed at Hannoversch Münden by the confluence of the rivers Fulda and Werra, it flows through Lower Saxony, then reaching the Hanseatic-town Bremen (see: Hanseatic League), before emptying further north at Bremerhaven into the North Sea. On the opposite (west) bank is the town of Nordenham at the foot of the Butjadingen Peninsula; thus, the mouth of the river is in Lower Saxony. The Weser has an overall length of . Together with its Werra tributary, which originates in Thuringia, its length is . - Albert Pierrepoint (30 March 1905 10 July 1992) was a long-serving hangman in England. He executed at least 400 people, including William Joyce (\\"Lord Haw-Haw\\") and John Amery. In Germany and Austria after the war, he executed some 200 people who had been convicted of war crimes. In England, Timothy Evans was hanged by Pierrepoint for a crime committed by his neighbour John Christie, who was also hanged by Pierrepoint. - Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom. The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff. - The War Office was a department of the British Government responsible for the administration of the British Army between the 17th century and 1964, when its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Defence. - A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the law of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility. Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners, torture, destroying civilian property, taking hostages, perfidy, rape, using child soldiers, pillaging, declaring that no quarter will be given, and using weapons that cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. - A gallows (or scaffold) is a frame, typically wooden, used for execution by hanging, or as a means of torture before execution, as was used when being hanged, drawn and quartered. - Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck. The \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" states that hanging in this sense is \\"specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck\\", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain \\"hanging\\". Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times, and is the official execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first account of execution by hanging was in Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". In this specialised meaning of the common word \\"hang\\", the past and past participle is \\"hanged\\" instead of \\"hung\\". - John Amery (14 March 1912 19 December 1945) was a British fascist who proposed to the Wehrmacht the formation of a British volunteer force (that subsequently became the British Free Corps) and made recruitment efforts and propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany. He was executed for treason after the war. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'occupation'.

She is in love with the woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), but her parents Cesaire (Billy Burke) and Suzette (Virginia Madsen) have promised wealthy blacksmith Adrian Lazar (Michael Shanks) that Valerie will marry his son Henry (Max Irons) hoping Valerie will marry into wealth so she and they can live off Lazar's money.Valerie plans to run away with Peter, but their plans are put on hold when the town sirens erupt, telling the couple that the werewolf who terrorizes their village has struck again. On closer inspection of the victim (found among a field of haystacks), it is found to be Lucy, Valerie's older sister. The townspeople offer a monthly sacrifice to the beast and stay away from the woods but Lucy ventured there after discovering that Valerie had been promised in engagement to Henry, whom Lucy loved.Adrian, Henry, Peter, Cesaire, and the other men venture out into the woods to a mountain cave hunt the Wolf. Against Henry's protest, the group splits into two groups and Henry and his father are attacked. The others manage to behead the wolf, but it kills Adrian in the process. The men bring back the head of a common gray wolf, thinking it is the one that has been terrorizing the village.Valerie sees Suzette crying over Adrian's body and confronts her. Suzette admits that she and Adrian once had an affair and that Lucy is actually his daughter as well as Henry's half-sister. This is the reason why she could not be offered to him. Valerie also learns that Cesaire is seemingly unaware of this.The townspeople decide to celebrate the death of the wolf, but their preparations are interrupted by the arrival of famous witch hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), who reveals that the townspeople did not slaughter the real Wolf because it would have changed back into its human form if they did.

Given the above question, please answer with reasoning first!","output":"No, a crane (the bird) cannot perform a slam dunk in the traditional sense that we associate with basketball. There are several reasons for this: 1. Lack of Physical Abilities: Cranes are tall birds known for their long legs and elegant necks, but they do not possess the physical abilities needed to perform a slam dunk such as grasping or holding an object, like a basketball, with their feet or beak. Their wings are designed for flying and their feet for wading or walking, not for manipulating objects. 2. Different Aerial Skills: While cranes are adept at flying, their physical abilities and flight patterns do not accommodate the fast, dynamic movements needed to perform a slam dunk in a basketball game. Most cranes glide and soar and are not agile enough for the quick maneuvering of a slam dunk. 3. Lack of Cognitive Understanding: Cranes, like other birds, do not have the cognitive ability to comprehend the rules and objectives of a basketball game or the concept of a slam dunk. These birds are adapted to their natural environment, where their main focus is foraging for food, breeding, and avoiding predators—not understanding or participating in human sports. In conclusion, a crane (the bird) cannot perform a slam dunk due to their physical, aerial, and cognitive limitations. The concept of a crane slam dunking a basketball is purely hypothetical and not grounded in reality."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person that notes the large amount of locales in the opera written by the man who had practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man? In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person that notes the large amount of locales in the opera written by the man who had practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man is Macdonald. Hugh Macdonald is the biographer for Massenet, and he lists a great number of locales depicted in Massenet's operas."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: who led a team of soldiers/ If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\".

Desktop users may find the USB ports on the back or the front of the desktop tower, though iMacs have the USB ports on the back of the monitor itself. There are two main types of USB ports found on modern computers: USB 3.0 — A thin, rectangular slot that's about 3/4 of an inch (a little under two centimeters) wide. You should see a chunk of plastic in the upper half of this slot. USB 3.0 slots are found on the majority of Windows computers and on most Mac computers manufactured prior to 2016. USB-C — A thin, oval slot that's about 1/2 of an inch (a little over a centimeter) wide. These are most commonly found on MacBook and MacBook Pro computers, though some Windows laptops also have USB-C ports. If your computer has both types of port, you're free to use whichever port you like depending on your USB flash drive type. Look at the metal connector end of your flash drive: If the connector is rectangular and has a piece of plastic taking up part of the connector, you have a USB 3.0 flash drive. If the connector is oval and has no piece of plastic inside of it, you have a USB-C flash drive. If the flash drive that you want to use is a USB 3.0 version but your computer uses USB-C ports, you'll need to buy a USB-C adapter and plug it into the USB-C port on your computer. This is most common on MacBooks and MacBook Pros from 2016 and up, though some Windows computers also have only USB-C ports. If you're using a USB 3.0 flash drive, make sure that the plastic piece in the flash drive's connector is at the bottom of the flash drive so as to slide under the piece of plastic that's at the top of the USB 3.0 port. USB-C flash drives can be inserted either way. If you're using a USB-C adapter, you'll plug your USB flash drive into a USB 3.9 slot in the adapter instead.

How many hours does Steve spend with his family in a day? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Identify the fractions of the day spent sleeping, in school, and on assignments. Steve spends 1/3 of the day sleeping, 1/6 of the day in school, and 1/12 of the day on assignments. Step 2: Determine the total fraction of the day spent on these activities. To find the total fraction of the day spent on these activities, you simply add the three fractions together: (1/3) + (1/6) + (1/12) Step 3: Find the common denominator for combining the fractions. In this case, the common denominator would be 12. So, we will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 12: (4/12) + (2/12) + (1/12) Step 4: Add the numerators while the denominator remains the same. (4/12) + (2/12) + (1/12) = (4+2+1)/12 = 7/12 Steve spends 7/12 of the day sleeping, in school, and on assignments. Step 5: Subtract the total fraction spent on these activities from 1 to find the remaining fraction of the day spent with his family. 1 - (7/12) = (12/12) - (7/12) = (12-7)/12 = 5/12 Steve spends 5/12 of the day with his family. Step 6: Calculate the hours spent with his family. There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how many hours Steve spends with his family, multiply the fraction of the day he spends with them by the total number of hours in a day.

Ashley Collman. Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels really wants to end debate that his show lacks diversity. In addition to hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member on the sketch comedy show, he's also added two new black comediennes to join the white male-dominated writer's room. Comediennes LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones tried out for the opening cast member position last month, and the show's producers were so impressed with their auditions that they were hired to write the jokes. Scroll down for video. New hires: LaKendra Tookes (left) and Leslie Jones (right) were hired as Saturday Night Live writers after auditioning for a cast member position last month. They will join a mostly white male-dominated writer's room on the sketch comedy show as creator Lorne Michaels seeks to address lack of diversity complaints. The new writer announcement comes after Zamata's hiring was made official on Monday. Zamata will be the first black female cast member in six years when she makes her debut on the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. Jones was a finalist for Zamata's cast member slot, and has guest starred on such shows as The League and Sullivan & Son. She has performed at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles and her stand-up special 'Problem Child' was broadcast on Showtime. Tookes on the other hand is a former news reporter from Florida who has performed her comedy at iO West theater in Los Angeles. While neither women is slated to perform on the show, many SNL writers in the past have made the transition from writer to performer. Tina Fey and Jason Sudeikis made the jump, as well as current featured player Mike O'Brien. Hired: It was announced on Monday that Sasheer Zamata will be the newest addition to Saturday Night Live, filling a black female cast member void created when Maya Rudolph left the show in 2007. Live from New York: Zamata will make her debut on Saturday Night Live during the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. Rumors that a new player might be added. to the cast started last month, when Gothamist reported that auditions. were held earlier at the Groundlings theater for black. female comediennes in LA. The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times. that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the. first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season. 'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.' Michaels. also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was. initially hiring for the current season this past fall. He. saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their. performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for. the final auditions. 'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said. That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season. Michaels. says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of. the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them. into the last episodes of the season. While many have criticized the show. for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady. Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do. with his hiring decision. 'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.' This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live. has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the. 1985-86 season on the show. No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since. The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag. As a result, there have been no. sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season, excepting the episode which was hosted by Kerry Washington. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Maya Rudolph who is biracial. Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past. 'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.' News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet. Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. 'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said. It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured) Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel. 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.' The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels has addressed concerns about the show's lack of diversity by hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member and adding two new black comediennes, LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones, to the writer's room.

During the war, a church was erected at the Catholic mission in the Mi'kmaq village of Shubenacadie .

This could imply that Riley is currently in a learning environment and is being asked to engage with different tasks during their educational experience. Based on this context, some possible actions Riley might want to take next are: 1. Listen for further instructions: After completing a task, students often await additional input or guidance from their teacher. Riley might be paying attention to the next step or awaiting feedback on their performance. 2. Move on to the next task: If the teacher has provided a series of tasks for students to complete, Riley might want to proceed to the next item on the list, such as answering questions, completing a writing assignment, or engaging in group activities. 3. Seek clarification: If Riley is unsure about the purpose or the requirements of the task they have just completed, they might want to ask the teacher for clarification or guidance, so they can better understand what is expected of them. 4. Reflect on their performance: If Riley is particularly invested in their personal development, they may want to evaluate how well they completed the task, identifying any areas where they can improve and taking a moment to feel a sense of accomplishment for a job well done. 5. Share their experience with peers: Some students like to discuss their experiences with their classmates, either to seek their opinions or to offer help and advice. Riley might want to chat with their classmates about their performance in spelling their name, or engage in light conversation to foster connections and social bonds. 6. Prepare for the next class or transition: Depending on how the learning environment is structured, Riley may need to gather their materials, pack up belongings, and get ready to shift to another class or start a new activity.

Based on the provided information, the second effect in telophase is the formation of two new nuclear membranes. To answer the question, I will consider three possibilities: 1. If the perturbation occurs during or before prophase: In this case, the entire process of cell division might be affected, potentially leading to issues in the subsequent phases. This could result in more, less, or no effect on the formation of nuclear membranes during telophase, depending on the nature and severity of the disturbance. 2. If the perturbation occurs during metaphase or anaphase: In this situation, the perturbation might affect the alignment of the chromosomes or their separation. Consequently, this could lead to issues in the development or proper assortment of chromosomes during telophase. As a result, the formation of nuclear membranes might be affected, leading to either more, less, or no effect, depending on the nature of the disturbance. 3. If the perturbation occurs during or after telophase: If this is the case, it is possible that the perturbation will have no effect on the formation of the two nuclear membranes, as this has already occurred or is occurring concurrently with the disturbance. In conclusion, depending on when the crust's calm happens during the process of cell division, it can have more, less, or no effect on the formation of nuclear membranes during telophase.

Teens require approximately 8 hours of sleep per night to maintain proper health and well-being.

This shift causes teenagers to feel sleepy later in the evening and necessitates sleeping in later during the morning.

Kurtka, Nurseit's pet wolf, lives in the family's yard and takes long walks through the village with his master. \\"He's never _ ,\\" Nurseit insisted. \\"I rarely put him on a chain and do take him for regular walks around the village. Our family and neighbors aren't scared of him at all.\\" But wolf expert Almas Zhaparov said that the animals are 'far too dangerous' to keep at home. \\"A wolf is like a ticking bomb, it can go off at any moment,\\" he warned. \\"If nothing is done, the fashion could spread to the wealthy Kazakhs, who might try to keep wolves in the grounds of their houses, with possibly deadly consequences.\\" Social media users also expressed worry about the trend, accusing the government for failing to limit the practice. Nevertheless, the wolves don't seem to be posing an immediate threat.

Jamie Higdon Randolph from Cleveland, Tennessee recently posted a sassy video message to her Facebook page directed at women who like to wear ‘leggings.’ In her video titled, “Leggings ain’t pants,” Jamie said she was on her way to buy a new pair of leggings after she couldn’t find her own leggings and went to borrow a pair from her daughter. When Jamie realized those didn’t quite fit she left for the store to get herself a new pair and decided to share her thoughts about the popular fashion trend. “Ladies, it’s pretty much leggin’ weather,’ she says to start off her video. ‘I love leggin’ weather. I don’t care if you don’t like leggins, don’t judge me, they are comfortable. They don’t cut into you, they’re always the right length. You can dress them up, dress them down, you can look like a frat girl or you can look pretty classy in them depending on what you choose to pair with them.” Jamie went on to set the record straight when it comes to how the leg wear should be worn, “Some of you people like to use‪ leggins’ as britches, as pants, pants,” she says. “That’s not how they’re supposed to be worn. ‘If you can’t wear a shirt that covers your tail so that I can’t tell that you got some Aztec-print thongs on, you don’t need to be wearing ’em, [sic]” she said. Jamie added, if a pair of leggings are so tight that others can see tattoos through them, then they “shouldn’t be worn, period. That’s called pantyhose, honey.” She ended the video with a short summary- “Don’t do it.. You’re welcome!” The video has been viewed on Facebook more than 12 million times. ||||| Four years ago, fashion icon Tim Gunn scoffed when he was asked about the budding trend of people wearing leggings and yoga pants on the street. Nowadays, you can't stride down a sidewalk without seeing all kinds of athletic gear adorning people on their way to the pilates studio, grocery store, or work. Casual clothes have caught on. Heck, you can buy emoji-print leggings at Saks Fifth Avenue. So does Gunn still hate it when people wear those neon racerback tanks or jet black Spandex bottoms on the street? I get a deluge of sass when I ask him. \\"It's vulgar,\\" says Gunn. \\"Unless you're Robin Hood.\\" We're inside a tent in the shadow of New York's Flatiron Building for an event with Transitions, the lensmaker he has teamed up with. Ducking away from an endlessly refreshed meet-and-greet line, Gunn is fully buttoned-up, as usual; despite this September day's oppressive humidity, he's armored with a navy double-breasted suit. Gunn knows he's getting older, at 62, and he may sound stubborn, but he insists it's still important to present yourself respectably. Gym clothes won't do. \\"When did the leggings become a pant?\\" Gunn asks with an incredulous look. He wholly accepts stretchy leggings the way they were traditionally worn, as a layer underneath whatever else you're wearing. And they're fine while you're working out. Just change before you leave the gym. Comfort isn't an valid excuse, either, says Gunn. There are plenty of clothes you could wear that are cozy— say, a Diane von Furstenburg wrap dress, which has the stretch but remains sleek and chic. Unfortunately, the Project Runway mentor will probably be rolling his eyes for a while; it seems the torrent of Spandex isn't stopping soon. All kinds of fashion labels are now making activewear, hoping to ride the wave, from designer names like Stella McCartney and Tory Burch to such mass market tags as Old Navy and H&M. Activewear is even poking into the luxury realm, with new brands charging 400 or more for their leggings and yoga pants. It comes down to the occasion, Gunn says. Wear what's appropriate for what you're doing. Just as a swimsuit belongs at the pool or the beach, workout gear belongs at the gym, unless you're jogging down a sidewalk. Leggings as pants? You're basically wearing underwear, he says, and how does that make others perceive you? Even if you're just out running errands, what if you run into your boss, or an ex? \\"That's the thing about overly casual dressing,\\" says Gunn. \\"It says: 'I don't give a rat's ass about anything.'\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article discusses the opinions of two individuals, Jamie Higdon Randolph and Tim Gunn, who share concerns about wearing leggings as pants outside of a gym or exercise setting. Jamie Randolph, a Tennessee woman, posted a video on Facebook titled \\"Leggings ain't pants\\" that has been viewed over 12 million times. In the video, she humorously advises women not to wear leggings as pants if they cannot cover their behinds with a shirt, and if their leggings are tight enough to see tattoos through, they shouldn't be worn at all. Fashion icon Tim Gunn, formerly skeptical about the trend of wearing leggings and yoga pants on the street, maintains his dislike for it by describing it as \\"vulgar\\" in an interview. He also questions when leggings became considered pants and stresses the importance of presenting oneself respectably in public. According to Gunn, comfort is not a valid excuse for wearing leggings as pants, as there are many other comfortable clothing options like wrap dresses. Despite these opinions, it seems that the trend of wearing activewear as regular clothing will continue, with many fashion labels, including luxury brands, producing leggings and yoga pants. Gunn emphasizes that clothing should be appropriate for the occasion, and overly casual dressing may give off the impression that one does not care about anything. In summary, the article highlights the perspectives of two individuals who disapprove of wearing leggings as pants outside of exercise settings, arguing for maintaining a respectable appearance in public."},{"instruction":"Definition: This task involves annotating the answer type to a given question that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning).

Input: Passage: The Hotak dynasty was an Afghan monarchy of the Ghilji Pashtuns, established in April 1709 by Mirwais Hotak after leading a successful revolution against their declining Persian Safavid overlords in the region of Loy Kandahar in what is now southern Afghanistan. It lasted until 1738 when the founder of the Afsharid dynasty, Nader Shah Afshar, defeated Hussain Hotak during the long siege of Kandahar, and started the reestablishment of Iranian suzerainty over all regions lost decades before against the Iranian archrival, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire. At its peak, the Hotak dynasty ruled briefly over an area which is now Afghanistan, Iran, western Pakistan, and some parts of Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of a natural cause and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded the monarchy. He was quickly followed by Mahmud who ruled the empire at its largest extent for a mere three years. Following the 1729 Battle of Damghan, where Ashraf Hotak was roundly defeated by Nader Shah, Ashraf was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan with Hotak rule being confined to it. Hussain Hotak became the last ruler until he was also defeated in 1738. Question: When did the first event happen?

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Napoleon Dynamite Context: Preston High School was one of the filming locations for the movie. Napoleon Dynamite is a socially awkward 16-year-old boy from Preston, Idaho, who lives with his older brother, Kiplin Ronald \\"Kip\\" Dynamite, and their grandmother. Kip, 32, is unemployed and boasts of spending hours in Internet chat rooms with \\"babes\\" and aspiring to be a cage fighter; their grandmother leads a secret life involving mysterious boyfriends and quad-biking in the desert. Napoleon daydreams his way through school, doodling ligers and fantasy creatures, and reluctantly deals with the various bullies who torment him, particularly the obnoxious sports jock, Don. Napoleon likes to make up stories about himself whilst having a sullen and aloof attitude. Napoleon's grandmother breaks her coccyx in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious former athlete who lives in a campervan, treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a get-rich-quick scheme to sell numerous items door-to-door. Kip wants money to visit his Internet girlfriend LaFawnduh, while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and the loss of his girlfriend. Napoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college; and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from Juarez, Mexico. A friendship soon develops between the three outcasts. During this time, preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Deb to be his dance partner, which she accepts, while Napoleon chooses and attempts to persuade a reluctant classmate called Trisha to be his own date. Inspired by an election poster at the dance, Pedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl at the school. The two factions put up flyers and give out accessories to the students to attract voters. Kip, meanwhile, is head-over-heels...

The first sentence communicates a sense of disappointment or skepticism about the reassurances that the problem will be corrected shortly. By using the word \\"meaningless,\\" the speaker implies that the assurances have no substance or are not genuine. The second sentence simply reiterates this idea more directly by stating, \\"The assurances are meaningless.\\" It is a shorter and more explicit version of the opinion expressed in the first sentence.

If you can't wait, you can get 500 million in a lump sum. However, as USA Today recently noted, the odds of actually completing a perfect bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion.

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone or feeling communicated in a piece of text, such as a tweet, to provide an understanding of the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed within it. In this particular tweet, the writer is expressing feelings of tiredness after waking up from a long night, which can be interpreted as a mild negative emotional state; however, it is not an overwhelmingly negative or distressing statement. There are a few indicators that contribute to the overall sentiment in this tweet: 1. \\"I just woke up\\": This phrase sets the context that the writer is talking about their current state post waking up, providing insight into the physical and emotional aspect of their experience. 2. \\"from a very long night\\": The use of \\"very\\" in front of \\"long night\\" adds emphasis on its length and potentially hints at a challenging or a night filled with activities, which might have been an exhausting or an intense experience for the writer. 3. \\"I'm so tired\\": This is the primary source of the expressed sentiment, as the writer explicitly states their feeling of tiredness. It indicates that the experience they had during the night left them exhausted, and they might be seeking rest or relief. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as an expression of mild fatigue and negativity stemming from the writer's current state of tiredness. The tweet does not convey strong negative emotions such as anger, sadness, or frustration but rather focuses on the exhaustion experienced by the writer after a long night, making it a mildly negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

Step 1: Understand the term \\"syncline\\": A syncline is a type of geological structure that is formed by the bending or folding of layers of rock due to compression and tectonic forces acting on the Earth's crust. It is characterized by a concave-upwards shape, with rock layers sloping downwards toward the center of the fold. Step 2: Apply the 3D aspect to the concept of a syncline: A three-dimensional syncline is a syncline that can be visualized and analyzed in three dimensions, meaning it has length, width, and depth. Step 3: Compare the given choices to the definition of a 3D syncline: - A crust: This refers to the outer layer of the Earth, and not a specific geological structure like a syncline. - A gorge: This is a deep, narrow valley, usually with steep sides, formed by erosion and/or tectonic processes, but not necessarily associated with a syncline. - A peak: This describes the highest point of a mountain or hill, which is not associated with the concave-upwards shape of a syncline. - A basin: A basin is an area of land that is lower than its surroundings, where layers of rock are typically dipping toward the center. This description is consistent with the characteristics of a three-dimensional syncline. Answer: A three-dimensional syncline is a basin."},{"instruction":"Barton Fink is a 1991 American period film written, produced, directed and edited by the Coen brothers. Set in 1941, it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in Hollywood, and John Goodman as Charlie, the insurance salesman who lives next door at the run-down Hotel Earle. The Coens wrote the screenplay for Barton Fink in three weeks while experiencing difficulty during the writing of Miller's Crossing. They began filming the former soon after Miller's Crossing was finished. Filming began in June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third less time than required by Miller's Crossing), and the estimated final budget for the film was US9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. \\"There was only one moment we surprised him,\\" Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a tracking shot out of the bedroom and into a sink drain \\"plug hole\\" in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. \\"The shot was a lot of fun and we had a great time working out how to do it,\\" Joel said. \\"After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an eyebrow and say, 'Don't be having me track down any plug-holes now.'\\" Three weeks of filming were spent in the Hotel Earle, a set created by art director Dennis Gassner. The film's climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel's hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post-production. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternate set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at Long Beach. A series of gas jets were installed behind the hallway, and the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet, giving the impression of a fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes. The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock. The Coens edited the film themselves, as is their custom. \\"We prefer a hands-on approach,\\" Joel explained in 1996, \\"rather than sitting next to someone and telling them what to cut.\\" Because of rules for membership in film production guilds, they are required to use a pseudonym; \\"Roderick Jaynes\\" is credited with editing Barton Fink. Only a few filmed scenes were removed from the final cut, including a transition scene to show Barton's movement from New York to Hollywood. (In the film, this is shown enigmatically with a wave crashing against a rock.) Several scenes representing work in Hollywood studios were also filmed, but edited out because they were \\"too conventional\\".

A:","output":"A: The law that relates the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas is the Ideal Gas Law. The Ideal Gas Law is represented by the equation: PV = nRT where: P = pressure of the gas (in pascals, Pa) V = volume of the gas (in cubic meters, m³) n = number of moles of the gas (in moles, mol) R = ideal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)) T = temperature of the gas (in kelvin, K) This law combines several individual gas laws, such as Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, and Avogadro's Law, under certain conditions. It is an approximation that works well for gases at low pressure and moderate temperatures. However, it does not accurately predict gas behavior at very high pressure or low temperature, where the behavior of real gases deviates from ideal conditions."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Pineapple Express Movie plot: In 1937, a military facility is on watch behind a two-way mirror as a soldier (Bill Hader), smoking marijuana, begins to reveal very graphically what he hates about the army, but still remains euphoric. A high-ranking officer (James Remar) immediately closes the project and deems marijuana illegal. Jump ahead seventy years later, Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is a 25-year-old process server and habitual marijuana smoker. He makes a visit to the home of his drug dealer, Saul Silver (James Franco), to buy marijuana. Saul tells him that he may already know the identity of Dale's next customer, Ted Jones (Gary Cole). Dale drives to Ted's house and witnesses Ted and a police officer, Officer Carol Brazier (Rosie Perez), shoot a man to death. Dale panics and flees the area, but leaves his roach at the scene, which contains a rare strain of marijuana called Pineapple Express. Ted is able to identify the strain and sends his two henchmen, Budlofsky and Matheson (Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson) to a dealer, Red (Danny McBride), who tells them that he has only sold the pot to Saul. Dale flees to Saul's apartment and learns that Ted is a dangerous drug lord and could trace the roach back to Saul. Dale and Saul flee into the nearby woods while Ted's henchmen persuade Red to arrange a meeting with Saul. They accidentally fall asleep in Dale's car and wake up to find that they missed their meeting with Red. They leave the woods and arrive at Red's house, hoping to determine whether Ted has linked them with the Pineapple Express. Red says Ted isn't after them but Dale realizes that he's lying, and starts a fight that results in Red getting knocked out. They wake Red and question him until he reveals that Ted has discovered who they are and is going to kill them. Dale and Saul decide that they must leave the city. In order to leave town, Dale and Saul sell some Pineapple Express to raise bus fare. However, a police officer named Barber (Cleo King) sees Dale and arrests him for selling marijuana.

This step is crucial in maintaining the balance of gases within the body, ensuring that enough oxygen is supplied to the body while disposing of harmful waste gases like carbon dioxide. Here's a detailed explanation of the final step: 1. As the bloodstream transports carbon dioxide back to the lungs, it arrives in the pulmonary capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels surrounding the alveoli. The alveoli are minute air sacs within the lungs that facilitate gas exchange. 2. In the alveoli, the process of external respiration takes place, where the carbon dioxide brought by the blood diffuses from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli due to the concentration gradient between the blood and the alveolar air. Simultaneously, oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries, again driven by the concentration gradient. 3. The carbon dioxide-rich air in the alveoli must now be exhaled. This occurs during the exhalation phase of the breathing cycle. The diaphragm, a large muscle located beneath the lungs, plays a major role in this process. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and moves upwards, leading to a decrease in the volume of the thoracic cavity. This causes an increase in the pressure within the thoracic cavity, which is now greater than the atmospheric pressure outside the body. 4. This pressure difference forces the carbon dioxide-rich air out of the alveoli and into the bronchioles, then the bronchi, and eventually into the trachea. The trachea is a large tube that connects the lungs to the larynx and pharynx, eventually leading to the oral and nasal cavities. 5. The carbon dioxide-rich air continues to be pushed out of the trachea and passes through the larynx. The larynx, or voice box, is responsible for producing sound, but during exhalation, the vocal cords within the larynx remain open to allow the air to pass through unrestricted. 6. The air then moves through the pharynx, a tube that connects the nasal cavity, oral cavity, and larynx. From the pharynx, the air is expelled out of the body either through the nostrils in the nasal cavity or the mouth in the oral cavity. In conclusion, the final step in the respiratory process, after the bloodstream carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, is the elimination of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation. This process is crucial in maintaining the balance of gases within the body and ensuring proper cellular function."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence that about [2011 PLAYOFFS Did not qualify].","output":"In the 2011 playoffs, the team faced disappointment as they did not qualify for the competition.

As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful action. He established the long-term political prominence of the Long family. A Democrat and an outspoken populist, Long denounced the wealthy elites and the banks. By 1935, Long's most recent consolidation of personal power led to talk of armed opposition from his enemies. Opponents increasingly invoked the memory of the Battle of Liberty Place of 1874, in which the White League staged an uprising against Louisiana's Reconstruction-era government. In January 1935, an anti-Long paramilitary organization called the Square Deal Association was formed. Its members included former governors John M. Parker and Ruffin G. Pleasant and New Orleans Mayor T. Semmes Walmsley. On January 25, 200 armed Square Dealers took over the courthouse of East Baton Rouge Parish. Long had Governor Allen call out the National Guard, declare martial law, ban public gatherings of two or more persons, and forbid the publication of criticism of state officials. The Square Dealers left the courthouse, but there was a brief armed skirmish at the Baton Rouge Airport. Tear gas and live ammunition were fired; one person was wounded but there were no fatalities. In the summer of 1935, Long called for two more special sessions of the legislature; bills were passed in rapid-fire succession without being read or discussed. The new laws further centralized Long's control over the state by creating several new Long-appointed state agencies: a state bond and tax board holding sole authority to approve all loans to parish and municipal governments, a new state printing board which could withhold \\"official printer\\" status from uncooperative newspapers, a new board of election supervisors which would appoint all poll watchers, and a State Board of Censors. They also stripped away the remaining lucrative powers of the mayor of New Orleans to cripple the entrenched opposition. Long boasted that he had \\"taken over every board and commission in New Orleans except the Community Chest and the Red Cross.\\" Long quarreled with former State Senator Henry E. Hardtner of La Salle Parish. While proceeding to Baton Rouge in August 1935 to confront the state government over a tax matter relating to his Urania Lumber Company, based in Urania, Hardtner, known as \\"the father of forestry in the South,\\" was killed in a car-train accident. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What would the new board of election supervisors do?","output":"The new board of election supervisors created in the summer of 1935 would appoint all poll watchers, further centralizing Long's control over the state.

Plot: Born and raised in a small town, Maraya, a 25-year-old aspiring artist, grew up with a constant nagging feeling of self-doubt, thinking she's ugly. Her dream is to escape her mundane life and make her name in the art world. However, she's held back by an unconscious fear that her physical appearance will determine her success. One day, Maraya stumbles upon a hidden antique store while exploring the town. She discovers a magical mirror that reflects her image as breathtakingly beautiful. Intrigued and in doubt, she purchases the mirror and takes it home. As Maraya spends more time looking into the mirror, she begins to question the power of her newfound confidence and happiness - is it because of how she sees herself or her growth as an artist? As her work gains recognition, she starts to deal with the challenges of newfound fame, including fake friendships, romantic interests, and questionable business opportunities. While at an art exhibit where her work has been showcased, Maraya finds herself entranced by the charming and honest Lucian, a blind art critic who admires her pieces without knowing her physical appearance. They begin an intense and genuine connection but are quickly pressured by the public's expectations and their own insecurities. To prove her worth and challenge societal norms, Maraya decides to create her most ambitious art piece yet - a live demonstration of her painting skills obscured by an opaque screen, forcing the audience to solely focus on her work. As she completes the painting, Maraya faces the truth that she has always been beautiful, regardless of the magical mirror, and that true beauty comes from within.

If Mona is comparing an orange and an apple and she determines that the apple is more massive then the orange, which object has more gravity orange or apple? Answer:","output":"When talking about gravity, it's important to understand that the concept refers to the force attracting two objects with mass towards one another. In this case, we are comparing the gravity between an apple and an orange, and your question indicates that the apple is more massive than the orange. To answer the question, we need to take a closer look at the gravitational force and the factors that influence it. The gravitational force acting between two objects is determined by the following formula: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 where F is the force of gravity, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 N m^2/kg^2), m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects involved, and r is the distance between the centers of the two objects. From this equation, it's clear that the force of gravity is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the objects involved (m1 * m2), meaning that the greater the mass of an object, the stronger the gravitational force it will exert. It is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects (r^2), meaning that as the distance between the objects increases, the force of gravity decreases. In the case of the apple and the orange, given that the apple has a larger mass, it would exert a stronger gravitational force compared to the orange when interacting with any other object, such as the Earth or another fruit. Consequently, the apple would have more gravity than the orange, as its larger mass results in a stronger force being generated according to the gravitational formula. However, it is important to note that the force of gravity acting on both the apple and the orange is primarily determined by their interaction with Earth's mass, rather than their individual masses with respect to each other. Earth's mass is significantly larger than either the apple or the orange, and its gravitational pull is what we typically perceive as gravity. Nonetheless, in terms of comparing the apple and the orange in the context of their individual masses and gravitational forces, the apple would still have more gravity than the orange due to its larger mass."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less root system happens, how will it affect less conversion into sugars. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having a smaller root system can have a significant effect on the process of converting inputs into sugars, both directly and indirectly. The reduction in root system size impacts the plant's ability to absorb water, minerals, and potentially carbon dioxide, which are all necessary for photosynthesis and the subsequent production of sugars. Direct effects of smaller root system: 1. Less water absorption: A smaller root system means less surface area and fewer root hair cells for water absorption. This can lead to inadequate water uptake, which not only affects the necessary water input for photosynthesis but also impacts the overall plant health and turgor pressure, which helps maintain plant structure and proper cell functioning. 2. Fewer minerals absorbed: With a smaller root system, plants will also struggle with absorbing essential minerals, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, that are necessary for various biochemical processes, including the production of sugars. When fewer minerals are absorbed, the plant's overall metabolic functions and growth can be negatively affected. 3. Carbon dioxide absorption: While in most plants, the majority of carbon dioxide is absorbed through stomata, there are some species of plants that also uptake carbon dioxide through their roots. In such cases, a smaller root system can lead to less carbon dioxide absorption, directly impacting the rate of photosynthesis and sugar production. Indirect effects of a smaller root system: 1. Slower growth rate: A smaller root system can lead to slower plant growth rates due to limited absorption capabilities. As a result, there will be fewer cells with chlorophyll, reduced light energy capture, and a slower rate of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to less sugar production. 2. Reduced carbon dioxide uptake through stomata: As plants with a smaller root system struggle to absorb adequate water, they may close their stomata to limit water loss as a response to drought stress. In doing so, they also limit the intake of carbon dioxide, which is necessary for photosynthesis and sugar production. This leads to reduced effectiveness of the whole process. 3. Weaker plants and vulnerability to external stress: Smaller root systems cause overall weaker plants that are more susceptible to pests, diseases, and environmental stress. This increased vulnerability can affect the plant's overall health and ability to maintain optimal photosynthesis rates, thus impacting sugar production. In conclusion, a smaller root system can directly affect a plant's ability to absorb water, minerals, and possibly carbon dioxide, resulting in reduced sugar production via photosynthesis. Indirectly, the reduced root system can cause slower growth rates, impaired gas exchange through stomata and increased vulnerability to external stress - all of which can contribute to diminished efficiency in converting inputs into sugars."},{"instruction":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

In this scenario, let's go through each of the options and understand why 'park' is the best answer. A. Country: The term 'country' refers to a large area that encompasses numerous cities, towns and villages. It is too broad to specifically point out the location of a single soccer field. B. Park: A park is a perfect setting for various recreational activities like sports, gatherings and leisure. It is specifically designed to cater to the needs of people who are seeking some outdoor fun and relaxation. Parks often have fields and courts for various sports including soccer, which makes option B the best answer. C. Town: Similar to 'country', 'town' is a geographic area that may include various facilities, including soccer fields. However, it is not specific enough to indicate the exact location of a popular soccer field. D. Countryside: The countryside generally refers to a vast area of rural land with low population density. Although it is possible for a soccer field to exist in a rural setting, the likelihood of having a popular or well-used soccer field may be lower compared to urban or residential areas. E. Near: This option does not provide any information about the location and is too vague.

One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

After this passage, the writer probably A:","output":"believes that constraints can positively impact creativity in filmmaking B: thinks that constraints have no impact on the creative process C: argues against the use of constraints in filmmaking Based on the passage, the correct answer would be: A: believes that constraints can positively impact creativity in filmmaking. Throughout the passage, the author discusses how constraints can enhance creativity, mentioning that students in The Film School in Denmark found constraints to be useful and inspirational in their projects. The passage also emphasizes the idea that creativity can be more effectively enhanced by changing environmental conditions and working within certain constraints, rather than just trying to think more creatively."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: How come a country (Vatican City), a so-called country, that is in essence 800 square acres of office space in the middle of Rome, that has a citizenry that excludes women and children, seems to attract the most attention in talking about public policy that deals with women and children? she demanded.

Obama committed to pulling 23,000 troops out of the country by the end of summer and sticking to the 2014 deadline to turn security fully over to the Afghan government. He said that NATO will set a goal this month for Afghan forces to be in the lead for combat operations next year. \\"We will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains. That will be the job of the Afghan people,\\" the president said during a speech at Bagram Air Base. Read extensive excerpts of the speech. His unannounced trip was Obama's third visit to Afghanistan since taking office. It coincided with the first anniversary of the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden in neighboring Pakistan, and comes as Obama is fighting for re-election. Hours after Obama left the country, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force reported a loud explosion in the capital, Kabul. Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi, Kabul chief of police, told CNN it was a suicide car bomb. The blast killed five people outside a compound known as Green Village, according Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for Afghan Interior Ministry. An undetermined number of others also were injured. The president promised not to keep troops in harm's way \\"a single day longer than is absolutely required for our national security,\\" but promised to \\"finish the job\\" and \\"end this war responsibly.\\" Obama spoke of a \\"negotiated peace,\\" and said his administration has been in direct talks with the Taliban. \\"We've made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with al Qaeda, renounce violence, and abide by Afghan laws,\\" he said. Finally, the president vowed: \\"This time of war began in Afghanistan, and this is where it will end.\\" Earlier in his trip, Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai signed an agreement outlining cooperation between their countries once the U.S.-led international force withdraws in 2014. Some U.S. forces will remain in a post-war Afghanistan as military advisers, but both U.S. and Afghan officials have yet to decide how many troops will continue supporting the Afghan military, and for how long. See reactions to Obama's surprise trip. At a signing ceremony for the Strategic Partnership Agreement, Obama said that neither country asked for the war that began more than a decade ago, but now they would work in partnership for a peaceful future. \\"There will be difficult days ahead, but as we move forward in our transition, I'm confident that Afghan forces will grow stronger; the Afghan people will take control of their future,\\" Obama said. Addressing a concern in Afghanistan that the United States will abandon the country once its troops leave, Obama said, \\"With this agreement, I am confident that the Afghan people will understand that the United States will stand by them.\\" He later added that the United States \\"did not come here to claim resources or to claim territory. We came here with a very clear mission to destroy al Qaeda,\\" referring to the terrorist organization responsible for the September 11, 2001, attacks. Obama's address came nine years to the day after then-President George W. Bush delivered his \\"Mission Accomplished\\" speech aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, announcing the end of major combat operations in Iraq. Karzai offered his thanks to the American people for helping Afghanistan, and the presidents shook hands after signing the document in the atrium of the King's Residence, part of the Presidential Palace in Kabul. \\"This agreement will close the season of the past 10 years and is going to open an equal relationship season. With the signing of this agreement, we are starting a phase between two sovereign and independent countries that will be based on mutual respect, mutual commitments and mutual friendship,\\" Karzai said. Obama warned the Afghan people and, later, U.S. troops he met with, of difficult days ahead. In remarks to troops at Bagram, Obama sounded emotional as he said that soldiers could see friends get hurt or killed as the mission winds down. \\"There's going to heartbreak and pain and difficulty ahead, but there's a light on the horizon because of the sacrifices you've made,\\" he said. The security risks in Afghanistan were evident from the secretive nature and timing of the trip. Obama landed in Afghanistan in the cover of darkness, and the signing ceremony occurred in the late evening. Back in the United States, politicians reacted to the president's visit -- some with praise, others claiming it was politically motivated. Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said, \\"I am pleased that President Obama has returned to Afghanistan. Our troops and the American people deserve to hear from our president about what is at stake in this war. Success in Afghanistan is vital to our nation's security. It would be a tragedy for Afghanistan and a strategic setback for America if the Taliban returned to power and once again created a sanctuary for terrorists.\\" Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, was less supportive. \\"Clearly, this trip is campaign-related. We've seen recently that President Obama has visited college campuses in an attempt to win back the support of that age group since he has lost it over the last three years. Similarly, this trip to Afghanistan is an attempt to shore up his national security credentials, because he has spent the past three years gutting our military,\\" he said in a statement. The Strategic Partnership Agreement provides a framework for the U.S.-Afghanistan partnership for the decade after the U.S. and allied troop withdrawal, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the flight. Specific levels of U.S. forces and funding are not set in the agreement and will be determined by the United States in consultation with allies, the officials said on condition of not being identified. Noting the anniversary of the bin Laden mission, the officials called it a resonant day for the Afghan and American people. More than 130,000 troops from 50 countries serve in Afghanistan, according to the NATO-led International Security and Assistance Force. The United States is the biggest contributor, providing about 90,000 troops, followed by the United Kingdom (9,500), Germany (4,800) and France (3,600). The war that began in 2001 is increasingly unpopular in the United States, with the latest CNN/ORC International poll in late March showing 25% of respondents supporting it and 72% opposing it. More than 2,700 troops from the United States and its partners have died in the war, the majority of them American. In 2011, the United States outlined its plan to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the NATO nations. Last week, Afghan National Security Adviser Rangin Daftar Spanta and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker initialed a text that outlined the kind of relationship the two countries want in the decade following the NATO withdrawal. The deal had been long expected after Washington and Kabul found compromises over the thorny issues of \\"night raids\\" by U.S. forces on Afghan homes and the transfer of U.S. detainees to Afghan custody. It seeks to create an enduring partnership that prevents the Taliban from waiting until the U.S. withdrawal to try to regain power, the senior administration officials said. Obama visited Afghanistan in March 2010 and returned in December of the same year. He also visited Afghanistan in 2008 as a presidential candidate. CNN's Tom Cohen, Barbara Starr, Keating Holland, Nick Paton Walsh and journalist Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.

Answer:","output":"In the United States, what is commonly referred to as a current account in many other parts of the world, particularly in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, is known as a checking account. A checking account is a type of bank account designed for everyday transactions, including depositing and withdrawing funds. It is the most common type of bank account used by individuals, families, and businesses for their day-to-day financial operations. The term \\"checking\\" comes from the traditional use of paper checks (or \\"cheques\\" in British English) as a primary method of payment and withdrawal from these accounts. Though the use of paper checks has decreased significantly in recent years—thanks to advancements in electronic banking, online bill payments, and wire transfers—the name \\"checking account\\" persists. Checking accounts in the USA often come with essential features that are similar to those offered by current accounts in other countries: 1. Deposit and withdrawal: Account holders can deposit and withdraw funds either through ATMs, bank tellers, or electronic banking services such as online banking and mobile apps. 2. Check writing: Checking accounts usually permit account holders to write paper checks as a way of making payments to third parties. When the recipient deposits the check, the specified amount is withdrawn from the payer's account and credited to the recipient's account. 3. Debit card transactions: Like with current accounts, checking accounts are generally linked to debit cards, used for purchases and to withdraw cash from ATMs. 4. Overdraft facilities: Many checking accounts provide an overdraft facility, allowing account holders to withdraw more money than they have in their account, up to an agreed limit. 5. Interest-bearing accounts: Some checking accounts may earn interest on the account balance, but the rates are generally lower than those offered on savings accounts. 6. Fees: Checking accounts may come with various fees, such as monthly service costs, annual debit card fees, or insufficient fund fees for overdrafts. However, many banks in the USA also offer \\"no fee\\" or \\"free\\" checking account options, which have minimal or no fees. In conclusion, while the terminologies might differ, current accounts in the UK and other countries generally offer similar features and functions as checking accounts in the United States, with both being designed to facilitate day-to-day financial transactions."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly!

Mr. Owens lived in Brooklyn. Mr. Owens, as a state senator and a former chief administrator of New York Cityâs antipoverty program, was a prominent figure in Brooklyn when he won the House seat vacated by the retiring Shirley Chisholm in 1982. Fourteen years earlier, she became the first black woman elected to Congress. Mr. Owens represented an overwhelmingly Democratic swath of the borough that included Crown Heights and parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Flatbush and Park Slope. The district encompassed stretches of severe blight and poverty, along with areas of middle-class stability and pockets of affluence. He viewed education as âthe kingpin issue,â as he put it in an article he wrote for the publication Black Issues in Higher Education. âWe have to believe that all power and progress really begins with education,â he wrote. As a member of the House committee that dealt with education, Mr. Owens spent much time sponsoring and shaping measures to put more federal money into reducing high school dropout rates, hiring more teachers and improving library services. Many of his provisions became parts of wider education bills. In 1985, he wrote parts of a successful bill that authorized a 100 million fund to strengthen historically black colleges. In a hearing on the legislation, he said the fund was needed because âmost of the historically black colleges are struggling.â He recalled his own days at one of those institutions, Morehouse College in Atlanta, from which he graduated in 1956. âMost of the youngsters there were poor, from very poor backgrounds,â he said, and Morehouse âplayed a vital role of nurturing.â Mr. Owens, who was considered one of the most liberal members of the House, opposed an agreement between President Bill Clinton and Congressional Republicans to give states more flexibility in how they spent billions in federal school aid. âWe cannot leave it up to the states,â he said. âThey have not done a good job.â On other fronts, Mr. Owens was a floor manager of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, aimed at curbing discrimination against handicapped people. He defended organized labor and supported proposals to prohibit the deportation of illegal immigrants who fell into various categories. Mr. Owens, whose first wife, the former Ethel Werfel, was white and Jewish, frequently urged blacks and Jews to bridge their differences. He condemned the Nation of Islam as a âhate-mongering fringe groupâ after anti-Semitic remarks by its leader, Louis Farrakhan. Even before tensions between blacks and Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights erupted into riots in summer 1991, he denounced the âRambo types on both sidesâ who, he said, only poured oil on the strife. Mr. Owens was a low-key politician, but he had a colorful streak; he wrote and even performed rap lyrics, for example. He titled one number, about male sexuality, âThe Viagra Monologues,â a takeoff on the name of Eve Enslerâs play âThe Vagina Monologues.â Other lyrics, which he performed in open-mike sessions at cafes and entered into the Congressional Record, dealt with goings-on in Washington. One rap number commented on a 1990 budget accord between Congress and the White House. Here is how it began: At the big white D.C. mansion Thereâs a meeting of the mob And the question on the table Is which beggars will they rob. Major Robert Odell Owens was born in Collierville, Tenn., on June 28, 1936, to Ezekiel and Edna Owens. His father worked in a furniture factory. In 1956, the year he graduated from Morehouse, Mr. Owens married Ms. Werfel. The marriage ended in divorce. He later married the former Maria Cuprill. After earning a masterâs degree in library science in 1957 from Atlanta University (which later became Clark Atlanta), Mr. Owens moved to New York City and worked as a librarian in Brooklyn from 1958 to the mid-1960s. He was executive director of the Brownsville Community Council, an antipoverty group, until Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed him to oversee the cityâs antipoverty program in 1968 as commissioner of the Community Development Agency, a post he held until 1973. Mr. Owens was a state senator from Brooklyn from 1975 until 1982, when he won the Democratic primary for Ms. Chisholmâs House seat. In a district so heavily Democratic, the primary victory was tantamount to election. His opponent in the primary, Vander L. Beatty, also a state senator from Brooklyn, was later convicted of forgery and conspiracy in seeking to get the result overturned. In his 11 campaigns for re-election Mr. Owens faced significant opposition only twice, in 2000 and 2004, when his primary opponents contended, to no avail, that he was no longer attentive to the needs of his constituents, especially the many of Caribbean origin. He retired from Congress in 2006. His son Chris lost in a four-way primary race to succeed him. Afterward Mr. Owens taught public administration at Medgar Evers College, a Brooklyn branch of the City University of New York. His book âThe Peacock Elite: A Case Study of the Congressional Black Caucusâ was published in 2011. Besides his son Chris, from his first marriage, Mr. Owens is survived by his wife; two other sons from his first marriage, Millard and Geoffrey, an actor who appeared on television as the son-in-law Elvin on âThe Cosby Showâ; three brothers, Ezekiel Jr., Mack and Bobby; a sister, Edna Owens; a stepson, Carlos Cuprill; a stepdaughter, Cecilia Cuprill-Nunez; four grandchildren and four step-grandchildren. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about Major Owens, who was an important person in the United States government. He worked to make schools better for everyone, especially for people who didn't have much money. He passed away at 77 years old because his kidneys and heart were not working well.

Neil adds salt to pretty much anything but Randy hardly ever does as Choose your answer from: 1). Neil hates salty foods.; 2). Randy hates salty foods.;","output":"2). Randy hates salty foods. Randy had always disliked salty foods, ever since he was a child. He preferred his meals to be more on the flavorful side, without the salty taste overpowering it. Neil, on the other hand, was all about the salt – that extra pinch of seasoning was the perfect finishing touch to any meal in his eyes. Neil and Randy had been best friends since they were kids, and it used to be that their mothers would make them the same meals when they spent time at each other's houses. Concerned about their preferences, the ladies made sure to accommodate both salt lovers and haters in their cooking, offering two versions of the same dish. It wasn’t an easy task, but these women knew the value of friendship and the role that mealtime played in keeping the boys close. As they grew older, Neil and Randy would bond over cooking together, experimenting with different ingredients and developing their unique perspectives on food. However, their attitude towards salt never changed. It even became a running joke between the two of them. One Friday evening, after a long week spent at work, the duo decided to dine out at a local burger joint. As they went through the menu, making their selections (with Randy carefully avoiding anything too salty), Neil suddenly had an idea. He looked at Randy and said, \\"You know what, buddy? Tonight, let's spice things up a bit. I dare you to try the saltiest dish on the menu.\\" Randy nervously chuckled, but he knew that Neil was up for a challenge, so he agreed. The boys picked \\"The Salt Bomb,\\" a burger that boasted a combination of crispy bacon, crumbled blue cheese, and smothered in a homemade \\"salt-lovers\\" sauce. When the dish arrived at their table, the look on Randy's face said it all. He was both intrigued and terrified at the same time. Neil leaned back in his chair, smirking as his friend prepared himself to take the first bite. With a deep breath, Randy sank his teeth into the burger, and his eyes widened in shock. To Neil's surprise, Randy didn't seem to hate it. As he chewed, Randy's surprise turned into genuine enjoyment. The blend of flavors seemed to mesh well together, creating a harmony that somehow balanced the saltiness. It turned out that the salt-lovers sauce had depth to it - it was not only salty but also packed with herbs, garlic, and a hint of sweetness from caramelized onions. It was a moment of revelation for Randy when he realized that it wasn't the salt he had always disliked, but the blandness that sometimes came with it. When salt is used to enhance flavors, rather than overpower them, the result can be delicious. He knew that Neil had been right, and the adventure in taste had brought the friends even closer. From that day forward, Randy became more open to the idea of salt in cooking. While he had no desire to become a salt enthusiast like Neil, he learned that a little bit of salt wasn't always a bad thing. Through this shared revelation, Neil and Randy continued their culinary journey together, taking their taste buds on adventures that spanned different cuisines, flavors, and yes, even salt levels. And their friendship continued to flourish, stronger and more nuanced than ever, much like the meals they shared."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

Two noteworthy wide receivers, Wes Welker and Benjamin Watson, have both displayed their skills on multiple occasions to lead their teams to victory. However, in a head-to-head comparison of their first half touchdown catches, the question arises: Whose catch was longer, Welker's or Watson's? Let's take an in-depth look at both of their significant touchdown catches to determine who comes out on top in this \\"battle of the beasts.\\" Wes Welker's First Half Touchdown Catch Wes Welker, a former American football wide receiver, played for several teams in the NFL, including the New England Patriots. Welker was known for his quickness and agility on the field, often making impressive and game-changing catches. One of Welker's notable first half touchdown catches occurred during the 2011 NFL season. Playing for the Patriots against the Miami Dolphins in Week 1, Welker's catch came to life in the second quarter. Quarterback Tom Brady threw a deep pass down the field, which was connected to Welker at about the Miami 20-yard line. With his impeccable ability to slip through the defense, Welker took the ball all the way to the end zone, scoring a touchdown for the team. This reception spanned a remarkable 99 yards, marking it as one of the longest touchdown catches in NFL history. Benjamin Watson's First Half Touchdown Catch Benjamin Watson, a former American football tight end, also made a name for himself as a reliable target for his quarterbacks and a skilled route-runner. Playing for several teams, including the New England Patriots and the New Orleans Saints, Watson exhibited his prowess as a top-tier tight end. One of Watson's memorable first half touchdown catches took place during the 2009 NFL season when he was playing for the New England Patriots. In a heated game against the Buffalo Bills, the first half was coming to a close as Watson took position. Watson found himself open in the middle of the field and received a pass from quarterback Tom Brady. With a swift move, Watson dodged defenders and sprinted toward the end zone, ultimately securing the touchdown. Watson's touchdown catch covered a distance of 36 yards, contributing significantly to the team's victory that day. The Verdict: Welker or Watson? After closely examining both Wes Welker's and Benjamin Watson's first half touchdown catches, it's clear that Welker's was the more impressive and longer reception. Spanning 99 yards, compared to Watson's 36-yard catch, Welker's touchdown not only displayed his world-class skills but also made history as one of the longest touchdown catches in the NFL. While both athletes have showcased their talents throughout their respective careers, it is Welker who earns the distinction of having the longer first half touchdown catch in this comparison."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: bear, catch, salmon, top, waterfall","output":"A big, furry bear tries to catch a slippery salmon at the top of a beautiful waterfall, where the water falls down like a sparkly curtain."},{"instruction":"The Nigeria U-20 men's national soccer team, also known as the Nigeria Under-20s or nicknamed the \\"Flying Eagles\\", is the youth team for national soccer in Nigeria.

Here is an elaboration of the subject to clarify any inconsistencies. The Nigeria Under-20s, nicknamed \\"Flying Eagles,\\" is indeed a youth soccer team dedicated to nurturing talent and developing skilled players who could potentially represent Nigeria in the senior men's national team in the future. They focus on discovering and honing the skills of players under the age of 20, as stipulated by FIFA guidelines for youth competitions. However, the term \\"completely autonomous organization\\" might be misconstrued as an independent body. In reality, the Flying Eagles operate under the supervision of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). The NFF is responsible for governing all aspects of soccer within Nigeria, including the conduct and performance of the various national teams, such as the senior men's and women's teams, as well as youth teams like the U-20 Flying Eagles. This means that while the U-20 team plays a crucial role in the growth of Nigerian soccer and has its own distinct identity, it is not a separate organization. Rather, it falls directly under the purview of the NFF. Additionally, the Flying Eagles' activities, coaching staff, and development programs are all coordinated and managed by the Nigeria Football Federation, which ensures that the team adheres to both national and international soccer regulations and guidelines. These efforts and collaborations with the NFF aim to provide the best possible environment and opportunities for the young players to advance in their soccer careers and contribute to the success of Nigerian soccer on the global stage.

He is the son of Dale (nee Lewis), a high school admissions counselor, and Pete Wentz II, an attorney. He is of English and German descent on his father's side and Afro-Jamaican on his mother's side. He has a younger sister, Hillary, and a younger brother, Andrew. Wentz has bipolar disorder, and has taken medication for it since he was eighteen. In February 2005, Wentz attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the anxiety medication Ativan, and as a result, spent a week in the hospital. Commenting on the event to a magazine, he said: The suicide attempt was put into song form, \\"7 Minutes in Heaven (Atavan Halen)\\" and released on their album, From Under The Cork Tree. After this event, Wentz moved back in with his parents. Wentz later spoke of his suicide attempt to the support site Halfofus.com and cites Jeff Buckley's version of the Leonard Cohen classic \\"Hallelujah\\" as a song that saved his life. In 2006, Wentz started dating singer Ashlee Simpson. In April 2008, Simpson and Wentz confirmed their engagement, and were married on May 17, 2008, at Simpson's parents' residence in Encino, California, with her father officiating the ceremony. Two weeks later, she confirmed her pregnancy. Her surname changed from Simpson to Wentz and she was briefly known professionally as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. Simpson gave birth to their son on November 20, 2008. On February 8, 2011, Simpson filed for divorce, citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\". She asked for joint custody and primary physical custody of their son with visitation for Wentz, along with spousal support. However, a later report said that Simpson believed the couple simply \\"married too young\\", with the source stating that, \\"It was honestly a classic case of marrying young, having a kid young and growing apart over the years\\". Wentz reportedly did not want the divorce. Their divorce was finalized on November 22, 2011.

(Associated Press) Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters at her election night watch party after winning the South Carolina Democratic primary in Columbia, S.C., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2016. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Hillary Clinton won the support of an overwhelming majority of black voters, large majorities of men and women, and even a majority of voters under 45 on her way to a claiming a commanding victory in South Carolina's Democratic primary Saturday. There were few bright spots for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the exit poll conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. What the exit poll found: ___ BLACK VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY FOR CLINTON About 6 in 10 voters in South Carolina's Democratic primary were black, by far the largest proportion of African-Americans in any of the contests so far. And nearly 9 in 10 black voters supported Clinton. White voters were more closely divided between Clinton and Sanders. Black primary voters were more likely to say they trust Clinton over Sanders to handle race relations, with more than 4 in 10 saying they only trust her and less than 1 in 10 saying they only trust him. Just over 4 in 10 said they trust both. Among all primary voters Saturday — black and white — 8 in 10 said the issue of race relations was important to their vote. Among black primary voters, a third said it was the most important issue to them. ___ YOUNGER WOMEN FLIP TO CLINTON Six in 10 South Carolina primary voters were women, and 8 in 10 of them said they voted for Clinton. She was also supported by about 7 in 10 men. Six in 10 white women supported Clinton, while a majority of white men said they voted for Sanders. Clinton ate into Sanders' advantage among young voters. Although he was supported by a slim majority of primary voters under 30, she was supported by about three-quarters of those between the ages of 30 and 44, as well as 8 in 10 of those 45 and older. Clinton won a majority of women under 45, a group that backed Sanders in the previous contests. This time around, they divided the vote among women under 30, but 8 in 10 of those between age 30 and 44 said they voted for Clinton. Two-thirds of white voters under 45 supported Sanders, but among blacks, that group went overwhelmingly for Clinton. Clinton won the support of majorities of liberals, moderates and conservatives in Saturday's contest. Eight in 10 primary voters said they were Democrats, and 8 in 10 of them were Clinton voters. Among independents, a slim majority backed Sanders. ___ WHAT HONESTY PROBLEM? Clinton was supported by over 9 in 10 voters saying experience was the most important quality in choosing a candidate, and 8 in 10 of those said it was most important to choose a candidate who can win in November. She was also supported by 7 in 10 voters saying they want a candidate who cares about people like them. Among those looking for a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, Sanders and Clinton split the vote. Democrats looking for a candidate who cares about people like them or one who is honest and trustworthy overwhelmingly supported Sanders in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. In South Carolina, he was still supported by majorities of white voters who cared most about a candidate being honest or caring about people like them. Questions about Clinton's honesty have dogged her throughout the campaign and appeared to be a weakness in earlier contests. But in South Carolina, three-quarters of voters said Clinton is honest, more than the two-thirds who said the same of Sanders. ___ CLINTON TRUSTED ON FOREIGN POLICY More than half of voters said they trust only Clinton — not Sanders — to handle an international crisis, while another third of voters said they trust both of them. Less than 1 in 10 said they trust Sanders over Clinton. Clinton won majorities of voters saying they think the economy, health care or terrorism are the most important issue facing the country, and she even led among those saying income inequality is most important. More than 4 in 10 South Carolina primary voters said the economy is the most important issue, more than in any other state so far. ___ EXPERIENCE AND CONTINUITY Three-quarters of voters said they want the next president to generally continue President Barack Obama's policies, while just 2 in 10 want the next president's policies to be more liberal. Clinton was supported by 8 in 10 of those wanting a continuation of Obama's policies, while Sanders was supported by a majority of those wanting more liberal policies. Nearly 9 in 10 primary voters Saturday said they prefer a candidate with political experience to an outsider, and 8 in 10 of those voters said they supported Clinton. ___ The survey was conducted for The Associated Press and the television networks by Edison Research as Democratic voters left their polling places at 30 randomly selected sites in South Carolina. The preliminary results include interviews with 1,461 Democratic primary voters and have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. ___ Follow Emily Swanson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/EL_Swan ||||| A woman listens to Hillary Clinton speak at a Feb. 26 \\"Get Out The Vote\\" rally for historically black colleges and universities, at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, South Carolina. | AP Photo Black voters reject Bernie Sanders in South Carolina The primary results bode poorly for the senator heading into Super Tuesday. South Carolina's black Democrats really do not like Bernie Sanders. Not only did the Vermont senator get shellacked by Hillary Clinton in the overall vote in South Carolina's primary, his share of the African-American electorate was worse here than in Nevada. Story Continued Below According to exit polls, Clinton won black voters 86 percent to Sanders' 14 percent, a decline from his already poor performance with this critical demographic group last week in Nevada, where he secured 22 percent of the black vote. For Sanders, it's an ominous reflection of Clinton's momentum heading into Super Tuesday. “If he’s going to win this nomination he’s got to figure how he’s going to appeal to a much broader audience because right now he is struggling and he’s heading into a set of primaries in states where they don’t look anything like New Hampshire,” said Doug Thornell, a Democratic strategist and former communications director for the Congressional Black Caucus. “He’s got to figure out a way to tweak his message and I think in many ways he’s got to almost overhaul it because he’s been able to energize a lot of Democrats who feel angry about the political process, but I don’t think Sanders acknowledged strongly enough the progress that president Obama has made.” Since being ambushed by Black Lives Matters supporters in the summer of 2015, Sanders has expanded his policy focus to criminal justice reform and poverty in minority communities while sending African-American surrogates to key states. But, so far, for naught and the next few states on the Democratic primary calendar won't be any easier for Sanders. A survey by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling shows that the higher the chunk of black voters in the Democratic primary, the worse Sanders does. In Mississippi, where the black vote is 37 percent of the Democratic electorate, Clinton leads Sanders 60 percent to 26 percent. In Louisiana, where the group accounts for 32 percent of Democratic voters, Clinton wins the same share. \\"I think how goes South Carolina, and I've said this...there goes America,\\" said Rick Wade, Obama's 2008 African-American outreach director who recently endorsed Clinton. \\"This is a better reflection of what America looks like so you cannot win without the component of black voters in your coalition. You got to have it. And I think Hillary's demonstrated tonight that she has that coalition.\\" Clinton was buoyed in South Carolina by strong ties to national figures in the black community, such as Rep. Jim Clyburn. And during her victory speech on Saturday night, she name-checking Clyburn but also hit on issues important to the black community, citing Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland before pointing to Flint, Michigan's water crisis as she began to pivot to the general election against the Republican nominee. \\"By now we all know the story of Flint, Michigan, how a city's children were poisoned by toxic water because their state's governor wanted to save a little money,\\" Clinton said. Sanders, just minutes after the South Carolina primary was called, released a statement, conceding to Clinton in the primary. He thanked six black state representatives in South Carolina who supported him but otherwise made no mention of the black vote. \\"Let me be clear on one thing tonight. This campaign is just beginning. We won a decisive victory in New Hampshire. She won a decisive victory in South Carolina,\\" Sanders said in the statement. \\"Now it’s on to Super Tuesday. In just three days, Democrats in 11 states will pick 10 times more pledged delegates on one day than were selected in the four early states so far in this campaign. Our grassroots political revolution is growing state by state, and we won't stop now.\\" ||||| Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign has always known that it needs to play catch-up with black voters if it's going to win the Democratic primary. South Carolina was Sanders's first big chance to show he could make inroads with this group, and it looks like he completely and utterly failed. Clinton winning black voters 84-16, bigger margin than Obama in 2008, when he won 78-19 — Martin Gelin (@M_Gelin) February 28, 2016 That is, needless to say, very bad news for Sanders. And if he can't change those numbers, it's going to be a huge problem for him throughout the South as well as in several Northern states like Maryland, Delaware, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey. But beyond the primary math, it raises a kind of conceptual issue about Sanders's political theory: Given the centrality of African-American voters to the Democratic Party, it's hard to envision a left-wing political revolution taking place in the United States that they have so little enthusiasm for. |||||Summary:","output":"Hillary Clinton celebrated a commanding victory over rival Bernie Sanders in the South Carolina Democratic primary, winning majorities of both men and women, as well as of voters under 45. Exit polls highlighted that there were few bright spots for Senator Bernie Sanders, who appears to still be struggling to connect with black voters. Clinton was supported by 86% of black voters, and 6 in 10 voters in South Carolina Democratic primary were black; white voters were more evenly split between the two candidates. Clinton won majorities of white and black voters, liberals, moderates, and self-identified conservatives; eight in 10 primary voters said they were Democrats, up from 78% in the 2008 South Carolina Democratic primary, and 82% of them were counted as Clinton voters."},{"instruction":"Nicktoons is a British/Irish digital television channel, launched on 22 July 2002.

Choose the best option from the 5 given options and report that option. Q: Question: A bag contains 7 green and 8 white balls. If two balls are drawn simultaneously, the probability that both are of the same colour iS? Option A: 7/15 Option B: 7/16 Option C: 7/143 Option D: 7/18 Option E: 7/11 A:","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing two green balls or two white balls. We can do this using the concepts of probability and combinatorics. First, let's find the total number of possible ways to draw two balls simultaneously. The total is given by the combinations formula, C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) Here, n = total number of balls (7 green + 8 white = 15 balls), and k = 2 (since we are drawing two balls). So, C(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * 13!) = (15 * 14) / (2 * 1) = 105 possible ways. Now we need to calculate the two possible favorable outcomes: 1. Drawing two green balls: There are 7 green balls, so the number of ways to do this is C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 21 ways. 2. Drawing two white balls: There are 8 white balls, so the number of ways to do this is C(8, 2)= 8! / (2! * 6!) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 28 ways. Now we add the number of favorable outcomes (21 + 28 = 49) and divide by the total number of possible ways (105) to find the probability: Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 49 / 105 To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 49 and 105, which is 7. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD, we get: 49 / 7 = 7 and 105 / 7 = 15 So, the probability is 7/15. The correct answer is Option A: 7/15."},{"instruction":"- These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow.

Question 2: Which song gives you goosebumps when you hear it every-time? Why? Possible answers: a. no b. yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. They both inquire about a particular song that gives you goosebumps when you hear it. However, there is a slight difference in the way they are phrased. Question 1: \\"What is that song which gives you goosebumps?\\" This question is phrased more like a straightforward inquiry about a song that often causes goosebumps. The question assumes that there is one specific song that has this effect on the person being asked and that the song may be more or less consistent. Question 2: \\"Which song gives you goosebumps when you hear it every time? Why?\\" This question is asking not only about a song that causes goosebumps but also expresses interest in understanding the specific reasons for that emotional reaction. By including the phrase \\"every time\\" and asking \\"why,\\" the question delves deeper into the consistency of the impact of the song on the person and the underlying reasons behind the powerful emotional response. In conclusion, although the two questions are quite similar in nature, they vary slightly in their focus and emphasis. Both questions inquire about a song that causes goosebumps; however, question 2 seeks an explanation as to why that particular song consistently has that impact on the person being asked."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence and your task is to identify whether the sentence contains motion or not, by classifying the sentence into Yes or No. The sentence belongs to the 'Yes' category if there is an occurrence of a motion of a physical entity otherwise the sentence belongs to the 'No' category.

Hypothesis: There is no sanity to be found in thoughts of suicide. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Identify the premise and hypothesis. Premise: Like Mark Twain, who said that suicide is the only sane thing the young or old ever do in this life, we imagine that the elderly and the ill desire death rationally. Hypothesis: There is no sanity to be found in thoughts of suicide. Step 2: Analyze the premise. The premise suggests that suicide could be considered a sane act for the elderly and the ill as they might rationally desire death. It refers to a statement made by Mark Twain, implying that these thoughts are not signs of insanity. Step 3: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis asserts that there is no sanity in thoughts of suicide, implying that considering suicide is inherently an insane or irrational action. Step 4: Compare the premise and the hypothesis. The premise posits that suicide might be a rational decision for certain individuals (the elderly and the ill). On the other hand, the hypothesis argues that suicidal thoughts are inherently irrational and not sane. Step 5: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. In this case, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise and the hypothesis present contrasting viewpoints on the rationale behind suicidal thoughts, with the premise suggesting that it might be a sane decision under certain circumstances and the hypothesis claiming that it is always irrational. Therefore, the premise does not lead to or support the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Math Problem Solve -16*p - 145*p - 21*p = 2912 for p.","output":"Let's solve the given linear equation in one variable to determine the value of the variable p. Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. In this step, we will add the terms involving p on the left side. -16*p - 145*p - 21*p = -182*p (Add -16*p, -145*p, and -21*p) The given linear equation now becomes: -182*p = 2912 Step 2: Isolate the variable (p) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable that is -182. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -182.

Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

So no complaints ! ! ! Plus , it was really spicy as well . Answer the following question: Why was the speaker so satisfied with the dish ?","output":"The speaker was highly satisfied with the dish for several reasons, as described in their statement. Analyzing the key elements of their experience, we can identify the following factors contributing to their satisfaction: 1. Taste: The speaker mentions that the dish tasted like a \\"REALLY good plate of friend noodles\\" instead of maggie goreng. This suggests that the dish exceeded their expectations and was better than a mere regular maggie goreng. The fact that they emphasized the taste being \\"REALLY good\\" indicates that the dish left a strong and positive impression on them. It is possible that the unique flavors, seasonings, or preparation methods used in the dish resulted in a delectable experience for the speaker. 2. Comparison to friend noodles: By comparing the dish to a plate of friend noodles, the speaker is likely highlighting two key aspects – the texture and overall experience. Friend noodles are often known for their delicious and satisfying textures, which can range from being crispy on the outside to tender on the inside. Additionally, the friend noodle dish might have a rich, savory taste, which further enhanced the overall enjoyment of the dish for the speaker. On the other hand, maggie goreng could be perceived as a more basic or familiar dish for the speaker. Therefore, the unexpected similarity to a highly favored dish (friend noodles) contributed to the speaker's satisfaction. 3. Spiciness: The speaker also points out that the dish was \\"really spicy.\\" Spiciness is often an essential factor in the enjoyment of certain dishes, particularly in cuisines that highly value the heat brought on by spices and chilies. For those who prefer spicy dishes, the intensity of the spices can heighten their overall culinary experience. If the spiciness was within the speaker's preference range, it would have only added to their satisfaction. 4. No complaints: The speaker explicitly states that they have \\"no complaints.\\" This implies that the dish not only met but exceeded their expectations. They may have been pleasantly surprised by the dish's flavors, textures, spiciness, and overall presentation, leading to a highly satisfying experience. It also suggests that there were no apparent downsides or negatives to the dish, leaving the speaker with a positive memory of their experience. In conclusion, the speaker was so satisfied with the dish because it surpassed their expectations in terms of taste, provided a delightful texture that resembled a favorite dish (friend noodles), and offered the right level of spiciness that catered to their preference. The combination of these factors resulted in an enjoyable culinary experience that left the speaker without any complaints."},{"instruction":"Overpriced mediocre food.

There's no doubt it has saved hundreds of thousands of students from repaying debts out of their graduate salaries. But, as a detailed analysis published today shows, there is little evidence it has propelled many more working class Scottish students into university. The research was commissioned by the Sutton Trust in England, which has long scrutinised social mobility. In itself, that raises interesting questions about why this kind of work is not being funded within Scotland. The research, compiled by academics from the University of Edinburgh, points out that middle-class Scottish students leave university with less debt than any group in the UK. They do not pay tuition fees, and unlike the poorest students, it's the bank of mum and dad that's likely to pick up the costs of rent, food, books and bills. Not surprisingly it seems to have been a popular policy. But most of the progress in helping poorer students into higher studies in Scotland has been in Further Education colleges. Some transfer to university, but quite often have to repeat a year, suggesting it's not an easy experience. And pressure will build in the system as the number of total number of university places is limited by government. Today's report warns that it's the disadvantaged that lose out most from that limit - when competition for places is stiff, middle-class elbows tend to be sharper. The wealthiest students in Scotland are four times more likely to go straight to university than those from the poorest families. It's a gap that is bigger than any other part of the UK. There has been a scheme to ring-fence some places at elite Scottish universities for poorer students, which has been successful. That comes to an end this year, with the places being absorbed into the total, as agreed at the outset with the government. Last autumn, the Commission on Widening Access in Scotland warned the inequality in universities was \\"unfair, damaging and unsustainable\\". The Scottish government has accepted something needs to be done. Plans for a Commissioner for Fair Access are expected soon with details of how universities can be held to account. Of course without a further increase in the number of places letting more disadvantaged students in can only come at the expense of the better off. No wonder the National Union of Students is calling for more places, and in Scotland that could only be done by more direct funding. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The abolition of tuition fees in Scotland has not significantly increased the number of working-class students attending university, according to a detailed analysis by the Sutton Trust. The research shows that middle-class Scottish students leave university with the least debt of any group in the UK, as their families often cover additional costs. Most of the progress in supporting poorer students has occurred in Further Education colleges, which offer limited opportunities for transferring to university. The report claims that disadvantaged students are disproportionately affected by a government limit on the number of university places available."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What are students denied? Title: The War on Kids Movie plot: Blame for problems with schooling in America is often assigned to insufficient funding or the inherent failings of today's kids. In rare cases, parents, teachers, and administrators are also implicated. However, all efforts to improve the quality of education are doomed to fail if the system itself is not examined and understood to be the most significant impediment. After over six years in the making, THE WAR ON KIDS reveals that the problems with public education ultimately stem from the institution itself. Astonishingly all efforts at reform consistently avoid even considering this to be a possibility and the future for children and American democracy are at stake.In 95 minutes, THE WAR ON KIDS exposes the many ways the public school system has failed children and our future by robbing students of all freedoms due largely to irrational fears. Children are subjected to endure prison-like security, arbitrary punishments, and pharmacological abuse through the forced prescription of dangerous drugs. Even with these measures, schools not only fail to educate students, but the drive to teach has become secondary to the need to control children.THE WAR ON KIDS begins with the history of Zero Tolerance policy. In the 1990s, almost all schools began instituting guidelines that were originally designed to keep weapons and drugs off campus. Very quickly, school officials began to arbitrarily decide what should be considered a weapon and what should be considered a drug. Hundreds of situations followed where children were (and continue to be) suspended or expelled for possessing food knives, nail clippers, key chains, chicken strips, aspirin, and candy. Kindergarteners were even suspended for playing cops and robbers and using their fingers as guns. Under the guise of Zero Tolerance, administrators have been able to wield tremendous power without the burden of responsibility and this authority continues to be increasingly abused. Students invariably feel despondent and fearful in the Kafka-esque state that has been...

With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's..., can you guess it ?

Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What is origin of the excavating team? Movie title: Taegukgi Movie plot: In 2003, while digging up remains at a Korean War battlefield to set up a memorial site, a South Korean army excavation team notifies an elderly man that they identified some remains as his own, after finding his name on the active list, not on KIA or MIA lists.[N 1] Decades earlier, in June 1950, in the South Korean capital of Seoul, the Lee family go about their lives. Jin-tae Lee owns a shoeshine stand to pay for his younger brother Jin-seok's education. Jin-tae also bought a silver pen for Jin-seok. Jin-tae's fiancÃ©e Young-shin works with the Lee's noodle shop. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invades South Korea. Both brothers are forcibly conscripted. They then become a part of the 1st Infantry Division, fighting at the Pusan Perimeter and then advancing north. Jin-tae is told by his commanding officer that if he can earn the highest award for a South Korean soldier, the Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit, his brother can be sent home. Jin-tae willingly volunteers for many dangerous missions and is quickly promoted to the rank of Chungsa (Sergeant). His heroic feats during the urban battle of Pyongyang finally result in Jin-tae being nominated for the medal. His combat experiences quickly brutalize him into a cold-blood ruthless killer, which worries his horrified younger brother. The U.N. coalition is eventually forced to retreat all the way back to Seoul when the Chinese intervene in the war on the North Korean side. Jin-tae gets his medal but Young-shin is captured by a South Korean militia, and the brothers attempt to stop them from executing her for treason when she is accused of having joined a communist party under the Northern occupation. During the struggle, Young-shin is shot dead and the brothers are arrested for trying to rescue her. In the jail, Jin-tae's request to release his brother is refused and the security commander orders the prison to be set on fire when the enemy forces approach. Trying to rescue his brother, Jin-tae loses consciousness and wakes up to believe Jin-seok...

The self-described \\"rock and roll band with horns\\" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, generating several hit ballads. The group had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Since at least 2008, Billboard has shown Chicago to be the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in singles chart success, and since 2015, the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in album chart success as well. Concurrently with Chicago's existing career, lead vocalist Peter Cetera had begun a solo career. He proposed an arrangement with the band where they would take hiatuses after tours to let him focus on solo work (mirroring that of Phil Collins and Genesis), but the band declined. Cetera ultimately left Chicago in the summer of 1985. He soon topped the charts with \\"Glory of Love\\" (the theme song of the film The Karate Kid Part II), and with \\"The Next Time I Fall\\" (a duet with Amy Grant). Two more songs reached the Top Ten: a 1988 solo hit called \\"One Good Woman\\" (No. 4 U.S.), and a 1989 duet with Cher called \\"After All\\" (No. 6 U.S.). In 1992, Cetera released his fourth studio album, World Falling Down, which earned him three hits on the Adult Contemporary charts, including the single \\"Restless Heart\\". Cetera's former position was filled by bassist and singer-songwriter Jason Scheff, son of Elvis Presley's bassist Jerry Scheff. Guitarist Chris Pinnick also left the group prior to the recording of the band's next album. For the final Foster-produced album, Chicago 18, the band filled Pinnick's spot with several session guitarists, none of whom became band members. The album was released on September 29, 1986, and included the No. 3 single \\"Will You Still Love Me?\\", and Top 20 Pop song \\"If She Would Have Been Faithful...\\", in addition to an updated version of \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" with a video that got airplay on MTV. Soon after the album was recorded, the band hired guitarist Dawayne Bailey, formerly of Bob Seger's Silver Bullet Band. Bailey and Scheff had previously played in bands together, so Scheff introduced Bailey to the band in time for the Chicago 18 tour. For the 1988 release, Chicago 19, the band had replaced producer Foster with co-producers Ron Nevison, who had recently produced two albums for Heart, and Chas Sanford, who had worked with Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks. They topped the charts again with the Diane Warren-composed single \\"Look Away\\". It was the third and last Chicago single to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The song ultimately was named as the \\"Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 Song of the Year\\" for 1989. The album also yielded two more Top 10 hits, \\"I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love\\" and \\"You're Not Alone\\", both with Champlin singing solo lead for the first time, and the Scheff-sung No. 55 single, \\"We Can Last Forever,\\" in addition to including the original version of a Top 5 single titled \\"What Kind Of Man Would I Be?\\". The latter, also sung by Scheff, was remixed for inclusion on the band's forthcoming greatest hits record (and 20th album), Greatest Hits 1982-1989, and it was this version that became a hit.

Some state funded academies are tuned into national or royal (in case of the United Kingdom i.e. Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge) as a form of honor. The other types of academy is an academy of arts (see Academy of Arts) or combination of both (i.e. American Academy of Arts and Sciences). - The Hughes Medal is awarded by the Royal Society of London \\"in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications\\". Named after David E. Hughes, the medal is awarded with a gift of £1000. The medal was first awarded in 1902 to J. J. Thomson \\"for his numerous contributions to electric science, especially in reference to the phenomena of electric discharge in gases\\", and has since been awarded over one-hundred times. Unlike other Royal Society medals, the Hughes Medal has never been awarded to the same individual more than once.

Born Vina Fay Wray in Alberta, Canada on September 15, 1907, she later moved to the United States and became a naturalized American citizen. Wray started her acting career in the late 1920s and became known as one of the early \\"scream queens\\" due to her breakout performances in horror films. However, it was her role in \\"King Kong\\" that remains her most iconic role and the one she is best remembered for. In the film, Wray played Ann Darrow, an aspiring actress who is cast in a film by director Carl Denham, played by Robert Armstrong. The character of Ann Darrow is taken on a dangerous journey to Skull Island, where she encounters the giant ape known as Kong. The film follows the story of Kong's infatuation with Ann, his capture and subsequent tragic journey to New York City, where he ultimately meets his doom by falling off the Empire State Building. \\"King Kong\\" was directed by Merian C.

It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.The earliest parts of Ashton Town Hall, which was the first purpose-built town hall in what is now Tameside, date to 1840 when it was opened. It has classical features such as the Corinthian columns on the entrance facade. Enlarged in 1878, the hall provides areas for administrative purposes and public functions. Meanwhile, the Old Street drill hall was completed in 1887. There are five parks in the town, three of which have Green Flag Awards. The first park opened in Ashton-under-Lyne was Stamford Park on the border with Stalybridge. The park opened in 1873, following a 17-year campaign by local cotton workers; the land was bought from a local mill-owner for £15,000 (£1.4 million as of 2019) and further land was donated by George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford. A crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 turned out to see the Earl of Stamford formally open the new facility on 12 July 1873. It now includes a boating lake, and a memorial to Joseph Rayner Stephens, commissioned by local factory workers to commemorate his work promoting fair wages and improved working conditions. A conservatory was opened in 1907, and Coronation gates installed at both the Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge entrances in 1953.Hartshead Pike is a stone tower on top of Hartshead Hill overlooking Ashton and Oldham.

Little did he know that less than a hundred years ago people used to call planet A as Earth, planet B as Venus, and planet C as Mercury. Which planet would have lower pressure on the surface, planet A or planet B? Answer:","output":"The pressure on the surface of a planet is determined by multiple factors such as the planet's gravity, the thickness of its atmosphere, and the type of atmospheric gases. Therefore, we would need to look at the historical data of both planet A (Earth) and planet B (Venus) to answer David's question. As we know from historical data: 1. Earth's (Planet A's) atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atmospheric unit (atm), which equates to approximately 101.3 kilopascals (kPa). 2. Venus's (Planet B's) atmospheric pressure at the surface, on the other hand, is much higher than Earth's. It's approximately 92 atm, or about 9300 kPa. This is due to a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, which creates a strong greenhouse effect. Considering this data, it can be concluded planet A (Earth) would have a lower pressure on its surface compared to planet B (Venus).

For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \\"intercostal clavicle\\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) and the need to impress Elizabeth Random (May Robson), who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) by chance on a golf course. She is a free-spirited young lady, and (unknown to him at first) Mrs. Random's niece. Susan's brother, Mark, has sent her a tame leopard from Brazil named Baby (Nissa) to give to their aunt. (The leopard is native to Africa and Asia but not to South America.) Susan thinks David is a zoologist (rather than a paleontologist), and persuades David to go to her country home in Connecticut to help bring up Baby (which includes singing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\" to soothe the leopard). Complications arise as Susan falls in love with David and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible to prevent his marriage. David finally receives the intercostal clavicle, but Susan's dog George (Asta) steals and buries it. Susan's aunt, Elizabeth Random, arrives. The dowager is unaware of David's identity, since Susan has introduced him as \\"Mr. Bone\\". Baby and George run off, and Susan and David mistake a dangerous leopard who has escaped from a nearby circus (also portrayed by Nissa) for Baby. David and Susan in jail. They are jailed by a befuddled town policeman, Constable Slocum (Walter Catlett), for breaking into the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman (Fritz Feld) (where they had cornered the circus leopard). When Slocum does not believe their story, Susan tells him they are members of the \\"Leopard Gang\\"; she calls herself \\"Swingin' Door Susie\\", and David \\"Jerry the Nipper\\".[a] David fails to convince the constable that Susan makes things up \\"from motion pictures she's seen\\".

Answer:","output":"\\"Love, Leopards, and Lost Bones: The Huxley Misadventure\\" The movie title \\"Love, Leopards, and Lost Bones: The Huxley Misadventure\\" captures the essence of the unique and chaotic story involving paleontologist David Huxley, his pursuit of the final piece for his Brontosaurus skeleton, and his unexpected encounter with Susan Vance, a spontaneous and vivacious young woman. With the balance between love, mystery, and comedic elements, this title perfectly encapsulates the adventure that unfolds between David, Susan, and the various intriguing characters they meet along the way. The title highlights three main aspects of the plot—love, leopards, and the lost bone, all of which deeply impact David's life throughout his journey. \\"Love\\" refers to the unexpected romantic chemistry between David and Susan. Although David is initially on a quest to get the intercostal clavicle bone for his Brontosaurus skeleton and secure a significant donation to his museum, love enters his life in the most unpredictable fashion through Susan, leading him on an adventure far away from his original goals. \\"Leopards\\" is a reference to Baby, the seemingly tame leopard, and the other dangerous leopard who escaped from a nearby circus. These creatures serve as plot devices, as they bring David and Susan together on their journey to find the elusive animals and return them safely. Additionally, the leopards symbolize Susan's wild and untamable spirit, which gradually rubs off on David as the story progresses. The \\"Lost Bones\\" part of the title emphasizes the pivotal MacGuffin that drives David's story - the missing intercostal clavicle. The bone represents David's passion for paleontology and the critical scientific discovery he hopes to complete. It also adds an element of urgency and frustration to the plot, as David faces multiple obstacles in his pursuit, from Susan's determined attempts to keep him with her to George the dog, who steals and buries the precious bone. Finally, the subtitle \\"The Huxley Misadventure\\" underscores the protagonist's involvement in this chaotic world, while hinting at the unexpected and absurd turn of events that transpire throughout the film. It serves as a nod to the classic screwball comedies, which are known for their zany, fast-paced plots and slapstick humor. In conclusion, \\"Love, Leopards, and Lost Bones: The Huxley Misadventure\\" encapsulates the enthralling and entertaining nature of the proposed movie plot while keeping in line with the spirit of screwball comedy. By highlighting critical aspects of the storyline – love, leopards, and the missing bone – this title invites the viewers to immerse themselves in a quirky and romantic tale filled with twists, turns, and laughter."},{"instruction":"Rentokil Initial Plc, the British owner of businesses ranging from pest control to parcel delivery, tomorrow may report an 8 percent drop in first-half profit as heightening competition for contracts put pressure on prices.

Sir Geoffrey Howe, also known as Lord Howe of Aberavon, was a significant figure in the politics of the United Kingdom, particularly under the leadership of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, with whom he had a tumultuous but important relationship. He served in a variety of positions including Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary, and finally Leader of the House of Commons and Deputy Prime Minister. The quote you provided is extracted from his notable resignation speech, which he delivered on November 13, 1988, to the House of Commons. This speech is considered one of the most dramatic and important political speeches in recent British history. It was seen as a severe blow to Prime Minister Thatcher's leadership and played a key role in her eventual downfall. The cricket analogy used by Howe was particularly striking. Geoffrey Howe was known for being quite mild-mannered, and the comparison of Thatcher’s leadership to a cricket team captain breaking their opening batsman's bat before the game was an unexpectedly sharp criticism which resonated throughout the House of Commons and the British public. Howe's complaint was predominantly about Thatcher's approach to European policy. The key issue at the time surrounded the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Economic Community, later known as the European Union. To sum up, the cricket analogy was a critique on how he felt Mrs. Thatcher undermined her ministers' negotiations in Europe. Despite her public profession of supporting those negotiations, Howe felt her actions led to an inconsistency in Britain’s European policy and severely damaged the credibility and authority of the government, hence his resignation. His speech was designed to convey the frustration and reservations that he, as well as some other colleagues, had about Thatcher's leadership style and policies. It was one of the key events leading to Margaret Thatcher's resignation from the post of Prime Minister two weeks later. So, it had a significant impact on the political landscape in the UK."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: We can not live a modern life without traveling.

Which Persian king released the Hebrews from Babylon?","output":"The Persian king who released the Hebrews from Babylon was Cyrus the Great, also known as Cyrus II of Persia. Cyrus the Great was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, which was the largest empire of its time, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Indus River in the east. His reign lasted from 559 BCE until his death in 530 BCE. The Babylonian captivity or exile refers to a period in Jewish history when a significant number of Jews from the ancient Kingdom of Judah were held captive in Babylon, following the conquest of Jerusalem by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th century BCE. This was a time of great suffering and displacement for the Jewish people. Cyrus the Great's rise to power and subsequent conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE marked a turning point for the Hebrews. Recognizing the religious diversity within his vast empire, Cyrus adopted a policy of religious tolerance and respect. As part of this policy, he allowed the various conquered peoples the freedom to practice their own religion, which included the Hebrews. According to the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the Book of Ezra, Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple of Solomon, which had been destroyed during the Babylonian conquest. This event is now known as the release of the Hebrews from Babylon and marks the end of their exile. In addition to the Hebrew Bible, a historical document known as the Cyrus Cylinder confirms the Persian king's benevolent policies. The Cyrus Cylinder, discovered in the ruins of Babylon in 1879, is an ancient clay cylinder inscribed in Babylonian cuneiform and recounts the various military and cultural accomplishments of Cyrus the Great. Importantly, the Cyrus Cylinder describes how Cyrus allowed deported peoples to return to their homelands and restore their temples. Cyrus the Great's actions allowing the Hebrews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their temple had far-reaching effects on both Jewish history and the development of the Achaemenid Empire. The return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the subsequent rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon reinvigorated Jewish religious life and allowed them to reestablish their cultural and religious identity. Simultaneously, Cyrus the Great's policy of religious tolerance and respect, exemplified by his release of the Hebrews from Babylon, contributed to the stability and multiculturalism that would be a defining characteristic of the Achaemenid Empire throughout its existence."},{"instruction":"Gnarls Barkley is an American soul duo, composed of singer-songwriter CeeLo Green and producer Danger Mouse.

Junji Nakamura, president of Japanese publisher Tecmo, has slammed Sony #39;s plans for the PlayStation 3, accusing the firm of allowing its ambitions in the home appliance space to overshadow its commitment to games.","output":"This issue revolves around Junji Nakamura, the president of Japanese video game publisher Tecmo, and his criticism of Sony's strategy for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) gaming console. Launched in 2006, the PS3 was Sony's seventh-generation gaming device, competing with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii. Junji Nakamura's criticism stems from his belief that Sony's vision for the PS3 extended beyond its primary purpose as a gaming console, focusing too much on its role as a home appliance and multimedia center. This shift in focus, according to Nakamura, affected the company's commitment to delivering a high-quality gaming experience for its users. One of the primary reasons behind this accusation was Sony's decision to include Blu-ray technology in the PS3, a move that significantly increased the console's production cost and sales price. The adoption of Blu-ray allowed the PS3 to operate as a high-definition multimedia player, positioning it as not just a gaming console but as an entertainment hub capable of playing HD movies, streaming content, and accessing a multitude of digital services. Another contributing factor was the introduction of the Cell Broadband Engine, a high-performance processor developed by Sony, Toshiba, and IBM. While the processor was built to enhance the gaming experience, it was notoriously difficult for game developers to program for, leading to a longer and more complex development cycle for PS3 titles. This resulted in fewer games being released for the console, especially during its early years, and some developers even opting to skip the PS3 altogether. Nakamura's concerns centered on the potential harm these decisions could cause to the gaming ecosystem. By focusing on features not directly related to gaming, he argued that Sony risked alienating its core customer base who were primarily interested in playing games. Furthermore, the heightened production costs and development challenges may have discouraged smaller developers from creating content for the PS3, potentially limiting the platform's offerings and appeal. Although Sony's approach with the PS3 received mixed reviews, it's important to examine its long-term impact. The integration of Blu-ray technology and the development of a multi-purpose entertainment device helped pave the way for the next generation of gaming consoles. As time passed, other console manufacturers adopted similar strategies to create more integrated home entertainment systems, as seen with the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Despite initial struggles, the PlayStation 3 managed to perform well, selling over 87 million units worldwide and hosting an extensive library of exclusive and multi-platform games. While not without its controversies, the PS3 laid the groundwork for today's gaming consoles and their status as comprehensive entertainment hubs. In conclusion, Junji Nakamura's criticisms of Sony's PlayStation 3 strategy highlight the challenges faced when technology companies attempt to balance the demands of their core customers and the desire to innovate and expand capabilities. Although the broader focus on home entertainment may have led to some growing pains, Sony's approach has ultimately helped to shape the evolution of gaming consoles as we know them today."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Driven to despair, she decides to commit suicide by driving a car on to a railway track, taking Davey with her. She offers him some tranquillisers beforehand but, unbeknownst to her, he spits them out. His mother drives on to the tracks. As a train approaches, Davey tries in vain to drag her out of the car, himself jumping clear just in time. Two train crewmen, Tom Stark and Otis Higgs, seeing the car on the tracks ahead, argue about whether an emergency stop will derail the train or not. However, the train hits and kills the boy's mother. Subsequently, the railroad company calls for an internal inquiry and suspends the two drivers. Davey has spent the first night after the incident with an empathetic social worker, Susan Garcia. However, she places the boy with a cold-hearted, disciplinarian foster mother. Later on, after being confined to his room, he escapes by shattering the window. The authorities are alerted and a missing persons search is initiated. The boy obtains train conductor Tom Stark's home address. He turns up at the Starks' home and berates Tom for accidentally killing his mother in the train crash, but eventually he is placated. Tom's wife Megan insists on letting the boy stay although Tom initially disapproves. Caring for Davey gradually helps the couple rebond with each other. Megan is suffering from breast cancer. Having already undergone a mastectomy, she has decided that she will no longer endure chemotherapy and must accept her inevitable death. The couple have no children, partly due to Megan's illness and partly because of Tom's job. Tom is unable to deal with his wife's illness and implores her to continue treatment.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Janet Jackson was born on May 16, 1966 in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of ten children, to Katherine Esther (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson. The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion. At a young age, her brothers began performing as the Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio.At age seven, Jackson performed at the MGM Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976.In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family and later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series, largely due to the emotional stress of her secret marriage to R&B singer, James DeBarge. Jackson later elaborated on her time on the show in an interview with Anderson Cooper, revealing that the cast would occasionally play pranks on her, but she spoke fondly of them.When Jackson was sixteen, her father and manager Joseph Jackson, arranged a contract for her with A&M Records.

Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying to the north and the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD. Now answer this question: What caused the end of Wang Mang's regime?","output":"The end of Wang Mang's regime can be primarily attributed to a combination of factors, including the unsuccessful implementation of major reforms, the opposition that these reforms generated, and the devastating impact of natural disasters, specifically the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Wang Mang implemented a series of major reforms in an attempt to change the societal and economic landscape of China. Among these reforms were the outlawing of slavery, the nationalization and equal distribution of land among households, and the introduction of new currencies which led to the debasement of coinage values. While these measures were intended to create a more equal society and reform the economy, they ultimately turned out to be unsuccessful due to several reasons. Firstly, these ambitious reforms faced considerable opposition from various sections of society, particularly those who benefitted from the traditional system before the reforms came into place. The influential and wealthy land-owning aristocrats, for example, were unhappy with the nationalization of land and the distribution of land to the peasants, as it threatened their status and wealth. Secondly, the reforms were not well-implemented or well-coordinated, which led to significant challenges in their execution. For instance, the equal distribution of land became problematic due to the lack of clear and effective policies, leading to widespread confusion and discontent among the population. Finally, and perhaps most devastatingly, Wang Mang's regime faced its ultimate downfall due to catastrophic flooding events that occurred during his reign. Both the c. 3 AD and 11 AD floods were caused by a gradual buildup of silt in the Yellow River. This eventually raised the river's water level, ultimately overwhelming the flood control structures that were in place. The disastrous floods led to the Yellow River splitting into two branches—one that emptied into the north and another into the south of the Shandong Peninsula. The floods resulted in widespread destruction, loss of life, and long-term disruption in farming and agriculture. While Han engineers did manage to dam the southern branch by 70 AD, the damage to Wang Mang's regime was already done. In conclusion, the end of Wang Mang's regime was caused by a combination of ineffective and unpopular reforms, strong opposition from various groups, and the disastrous impact of large-scale flooding events. These factors ultimately culminated in the weakening and fall of Wang Mang's rule."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: The increasing prevalence of sedentary lifestyles and reliance on technology has resulted in a decline in overall physical fitness levels among the general population. In the last decade, the rise of fitness trackers, wearable technology, and mobile applications has generated a significant interest in personal fitness management. In response to this trend, many companies have started to incorporate wellness programs in the workplace, aiming to promote healthy behaviors, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and improve overall employee well-being. These workplace wellness programs often include elements such as physical activity challenges, nutritional education, mental health workshops, and incentives for participating in health-promoting activities. Despite the widespread adoption of such programs, there is limited concrete evidence on their effectiveness in improving the overall well-being and productivity of employees. Hypothesis: Implementing workplace wellness programs will have a positive impact on employee well-being, resulting in improved physical fitness, reduced stress levels, and increased productivity. This hypothesis posits that providing employees with the tools, resources, and incentives to make healthier choices in their daily lives will not only benefit their physical and mental well-being but also result in better performance at work. Employees who participate in well-designed wellness programs will be more likely to adopt healthy habits, such as engaging in regular physical activity, consuming a balanced diet, and managing stress effectively, leading to improved overall health and well-being. In turn, these healthier employees will demonstrate higher levels of energy, focus, and motivation, which will subsequently improve their efficiency and productivity in the workplace. Further research and analysis, including experimental studies and long-term observational research, will need to be conducted to verify the potential benefits and effectiveness of workplace wellness programs on employee well-being and productivity. By incorporating a variety of program elements targeting physical, mental, and emotional health, and by ensuring that these programs are tailored to meet the specific needs and preferences of employees, organizations can create a more supportive and conducive work environment that fosters well-being and encourages optimal performance."},{"instruction":"Coming off their road win over the Browns, the Titans flew to Heinz Field for a Week 5 intraconference duel with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Select from: - yes; - it is not possible to tell; - no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in a linguistic or semantic context means that the truth of one sentence ensures the truth of another. In this scenario, the second sentence is a simplification or a rewording of the events described in the first sentence, with no additional details or alterations to the core information that would negate or contradict the original sentence's content. To break it down: 1) Both sentences involve a girl giving birth. 2) Both sentences describe the event occurring in the setting of a high school. 3) Both instances culminate in the unfortunate abandonment of the newborn in the trash where both of them were later found dead. While the first sentence includes the additional detail about the event occurring during the high-school prom, it doesn’t significantly alter the entailment unless the condition of it being prom night is critical to the truth of the second sentence. Additionally, the transition from 'another girl' in the first sentence to 'yet another girl' in the second sentence infers a continuity of similar incidents but does not significantly change the entailment as it is an expression more focused on the frequency of the situation. Therefore, considering the above points, the second sentence is considered as being entailed by the first sentence.

Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B. In case B, would the number of mesopredators be less or more than in case A? A:","output":"In this scenario, let's first define some terms to better understand the situation. 1. Apex predator: These are the animals at the top of the food chain, meaning that they don't have any natural predators. In this case, the Siberian tiger is the apex predator. 2. Mesopredator: Animals that are not at the top of the food chain, but still consume other species, are referred to as mesopredators. They have predators of their own, which in this scenario would be the Siberian tiger. Now let's analyze case A and case B. Case A: During the sixteenth century, there was a stable population of Siberian tigers, indicating a relatively balanced ecosystem. The Siberian tigers, as apex predators, would prey upon and limit the population of mesopredators in their territory. Case B: In the seventeenth century, the introduction of guns led to a decrease in the number of Siberian tigers. When the population of apex predators declines, this can cause what's known as \\"mesopredator release.\\" Mesopredator release is a phenomenon where the reduced presence of a controlling apex predator leads to an increase in the population of mesopredators, as they face less predation and have more access to prey. Based on this analysis, it is likely that in case B, the number of mesopredators would be more than in case A. The reduced population of Siberian tigers (the apex predator) would give mesopredators more room to flourish, leading to a higher population of these secondary predators. However, it's important to note that other factors, such as availability of prey and changes in habitat, can also influence mesopredator populations."},{"instruction":"Article: Hold the cigarette between your index and middle finger, somewhere on the filter.

The chiropractor might also manipulate the vertebrae of the neck in order to decrease the symptoms of tinnitus. Chiropractic adjustments are not painful, but they may cause some temporary discomfort. The chiropractic treatment may also include the application of heat or ice and specific exercises. Chiropractic treatments can also help with Meniere’s disease, another less common cause of tinnitus.

The palace dismissed the newspaper's list as speculation Sunday. It won't be clear until the day how the royal couple has balanced the protocol demands that they invite statesmen, diplomats, religious leaders, politicians and the like with invitations to the people they really want to see, particularly the crowd they made friends with when they met and fell in love at St. Andrews University in Scotland.

William and Middleton have showed their modern side by inviting a number of close friends, including some former sweethearts, the newspaper said. The wedding is not technically a state event, which somewhat limits the protocol requirements applied to the guest list. But royal obligations still order that a large number of the 1,900 or so seats go to guests from the world of politics, not actual friends of the couple. The couple have also invited many guests from the charities they work with, and Middleton has used her influence to invite the butcher, shopkeeper and pub owner from her home village of Bucklebury.

Originators are a diverse group of talented individuals who play a crucial role in shaping our culture and society by producing various forms of artistic expressions. They are responsible for creating the content that defines literature, music, and theater, which not only entertain us but also challenge our perspectives and stimulate our imagination. Let's explore each aspect in further detail. 1. Literary Works (Novels, Radio Montages): Originators who work in the field of literature are skilled in the art of crafting written content. Novelists are instrumental in creating works of fiction, ranging from intricate tales that transport readers to fantastical realms to poignant narratives that reflect on life's complexities and struggles. Radio montages, on the other hand, are audio creations that weave together different sounds, music, and dialogue to tell a story or paint a picture in the listener's mind. These artists possess the ability to convey both subtle and profound messages through the written and spoken word. 2. Musical Works (Notes): Musicians and composers represent another group of originators, who specialize in the creation of musical works. They employ a variety of instruments and genres to create melodies, harmonies, and rhythms, weaving them together to produce songs, symphonies, and everything in between. The importance of musical works cannot be understated, as they evoke emotion, provide solace, inspire creativity, and mirror our cultural identities. Music transcends boundaries and connects people in ways that words alone often cannot. 3. Stage Work (Plays): Originators in the realm of theatre develop stage works, such as plays, that bring stories to life through a combination of dialogue, action, and visual elements. Playwrights create scripts that actors perform on stage in front of a live audience, with each production offering a unique interpretation of the text. These productions often tackle universal themes of love, struggle, and personal growth, while also incorporating humor, suspense, and conflict to captivate viewers. Stage works can also prompt timely discussions on social, political, and cultural issues, inspiring change and reflection in society. In summary, originators are creative artists who contribute to the rich tapestry of our cultural heritage through their individual crafts. By producing a wide range of artistic expressions, from literary works like novels and radio montages to musical compositions and stage productions, originators enrich our lives with thought-provoking, entertaining, and emotionally stirring content. Ultimately, it is through the efforts of these talented artists that we gain new ideas, perspectives, and means of self-expression, making them an essential part of our cultural and societal development."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A fluffy white dog hanging out of a window.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The dog is hanging out the car window.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Yet researchers still haven’t found many intermediate species showing just how swimming fish evolved to walk on land. Now, an endangered species only found in a handful of caverns in Thailand might finally help straighten things out. Related Content A Rare Blind Salamander’s Eggs Are Finally Hatching The species in question is a type of blind cave fish called Cryptotora thamicola, or the waterfall-climbing cave fish. Documented in a study recently published in the journal Scientific Reports, the creature uses its four fins to crawl over rocks and up slick walls. The fish even has a full pelvis fused to its spine—a skeletal feature absent from any of the other 30,000 fish species in the world. This particular feature, however, is found in terrestrial vertebrates and fossils of the earliest tetrapods, making the waterfall cave fish a unique window into evolution. “It’s really weird,” John R. Hutchinson, a biologist at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London tells Carl Zimmer at The New York Times. “It’s a good example of how much fish diversity there’s left to be discovered.” The species was first found in Northern Thailand in 1985 in eight caves near the Myanmar border. The Thai government is now extremely protective of those caves, allowing only a handful of researchers to examine them and their strange fish. Last year, Apinun Suvarnaraksha, an ichthyologist from Maejo University in Thailand and Daphne Soares, a biologist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology observed the fish on an expedition to those caves and took a video . When Soares shared the images with her NJIT colleague Brooke Flammang, a biomechanics researcher, she was stunned. “I was like, ‘Fish can’t do that,’” Flammang tells Diane Kelly at Wired. “That’s ridiculous.” Flammang hoped to get specimens of the rare fish to study, but that was not possible. So she began working with Suvarnaraksha, who returned to the caves and began briefly capturing the fish and putting them in an aquarium for filming before releasing them. He was also able to perform a CT scan of a preserved museum specimen of Cryptotora thamicola at a local dental school. Armed with that data, Flammang began to unravel the secrets of the cave fish. It didn’t take long. “When they sent me the files, I thought someone was playing a trick on me,” she tells Kelly. “There was this gigantic pelvis [on the CT scan] that looks nothing like any fish pelvis.” While it’s highly unlikely that the waterfall cave fish is an ancestor of ancient tetrapods, its evolution sheds some light on how other fish could have evolved to move on land. It also calls into question some of the 400-million-year-old tetrapod “footprints” scientists have found in recent years. Researchers may now need to evaluate those prints—the next likely candidate is the giant waddling fish. “The physics are the same,” Flammang tells Zimmer. ||||| Nature 463, 43-48 (7 January 2010) | doi :10.1038/nature08623; Received 21 July 2009; Accepted 29 October 2009 Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki1, Piotr Szrek2,3, Katarzyna Narkiewicz3, Marek Narkiewicz3 & Per E. Ahlberg4 of page Abstract The fossil record of the earliest tetrapods (vertebrates with limbs rather than paired fins) consists of body fossils and trackways. The earliest body fossils of tetrapods date to the Late Devonian period (late Frasnian stage) and are preceded by transitional elpistostegids such as Panderichthys and Tiktaalik that still have paired fins. Claims of tetrapod trackways predating these body fossils have remained controversial with regard to both age and the identity of the track makers. Here we present well-preserved and securely dated tetrapod tracks from Polish marine tidal flat sediments of early Middle Devonian (Eifelian stage) age that are approximately 18 million years older than the earliest tetrapod body fossils and 10 million years earlier than the oldest elpistostegids. They force a radical reassessment of the timing, ecology and environmental setting of the fish–tetrapod transition, as well as the completeness of the body fossil record. ||||| Pelvic girdle morphology We found that Cryptotora had a pelvic girdle that is connected to the axial skeleton via fusion with a hypertrophied rib of the seventh vertebra (Fig. 2A–C, Supplementary Video 2). The basipterygium, or puboischiadic plate (pu, tan, Fig. 2C), was broad in both anteroposterior and lateral directions and more heavily ossified than is typical of fishes (Fig. 3), with a large concavity for ventral attachment of muscles to the large processes at the base of the fin rays (pf, blue, Fig. 2B,C). The heads of the fin rays articulated with the lateral edges of the ischium. Figure 2: Computed microtomography scan (voxel size = 8 μm) of Cryptotora thamicola (47 mm total length).

(D) dorsal view of pelvis and fins. Full size image The ribs of Cryptotora were broader and extended more laterally than is typical of other fishes; the common goldfish (Carassius auratus), also of the order Cypriniformes, is shown for comparison (Figs 2 and 3). Notably, the goldfish pelvis did not articulating with the ribs, but was held in a muscular sling; this is typically the case for all other fishes in which the pelvis is not fused to the pectoral girdle anteriorly. In Cryptotora, the first seven ribs were broad and flat with an arch reflecting the dorsoventral compression of the fish body. The seventh rib (sr, purple, Fig. 2C) was more heavily calcified than more anterior ribs, which were only calcified around their edges. In addition, the seventh rib had a large, broad, flared process similar in appearance to the iliac crest which supports attachment of large hip flexors in tetrapods. The distal end of the seventh rib (originating on the seventh vertebrae) formed a ventrally oriented iliac process that passed through an arch formed by the pubis and ischium to fuse on the anterolateral aspect of the puboischiadic plate (Fig. 2C). The area of this arch where the puboischiadic plate and iliac process of the sacral rib united was the acetabular symphysis. (Fig. 2D). While extant fishes lack femora, they have historically had the posterior ridge of the pelvis, where the pelvic fins articulate, identified as the area of the acetabulum15,16. Exctinct fishes Gooloogongia, Eusthenopteron, and Panderichthyes posessed more cup-like acetabula in a similar posterior position, despite lacking limbs16,17. In contrast, Cryptotora had an acetabular symphysis separate from and anterior to the pelvic fin articulation with the puboischiadic plate. Also visible posterior to the acetabular symphysis was the obturator foramen, an opening formed between the ischium and pubis through which blood vessels and nerves may pass (Fig. 2E). The eighth rib did not originate off the vertebral centra as the seventh rib did, but instead originated off a transverse process of the eighth vertebra and extended laterally and hooked anteriorly, which may provide additional area for muscle attachment on the dorsal aspect of the fin. Based on their positions, we presume that the dorsolateral projections from the vertebral centra are intermuscular bones (im, light purple, Fig. 2C) - intramembranous ossifications which form in myosepta as a result of mechanical stress18. The intermuscular bone associated with the seventh vertebrae was different than the rest, in that it was attached to the dorsal aspect of the sacral rib and not the vertebral centra. Anterior to the pelvis, the intermuscular bones branched off of the neural arches. If these bones are in fact, not intermuscular, then they are skeletal structures that have not previously been identified in fishes. The vertebral column of Cryptotora shared several features associated with the evolution of terrestriality and the functional need to support the body weight of an organism outside of water: in particular, the wide neural spines, zygapophyses, and transverse processes of Cryptotora are features that stabilize the vertebral column in terrestrial vertebrates19,20. Broad neural spines are typically associated with muscle attachment along the vertebral column15. Large transverse processes extended laterally off the vertebral centra and zygapophyses extended in anterior and posterior directions (Fig. 2C). The centra of the sacral vertebrae were tapered ventroposteriorly, resulting in narrowing of the notochord which passed through the center. While a study of the development of the pelvic girdle in this cavefish has not yet been possible, it appears that structurally, the pelvic girdle of Cryptotora converges on tetrapodal morphology that supports muscular attachment and transfer of forces for terrestrial walking16,21. In other fishes, including those that can walk by crutching or lunging, there is no bony connection between the pelvis and vertebral column and the pelvis is held in place by a muscular sling (Fig. 3)16 or fused anteriorly to the pectoral girdle, as in the mudskipper22. However, in tetrapods, the ilium originates from the pubis and extends dorsally to fuse with a sacral rib16. The incomplete fusion of these two skeletal elements is visible in amphibians (Fig. 4), in which the sacral rib and ilium are joined by cartilage.

Full size image Walking kinematics Cryptotora thamicola walked on rough and smooth wet surfaces while out of water. We observed that Cryptotora could walk towards the direction of flowing water (Supplementary Video 3). Hillstream loach relatives of Cryptotora in the family Homalopteridae are known to have epidermal ridges and spines to facilitate adhesion to surfaces in fast-flowing water1,23, but it was not obvious from the μCT scans that these were present on Cryptotora. During walking, the body midline of Cryptotora (Fig. 5A) moved in a standing wave, and did not follow an undulatory, traveling wave pattern as a swimming fish might use. Swimming fish generally undulate in such a way that little lateral displacement occurs near the trunk and the greatest amplitude of undulation occurs posteriorly, in the tail24. All of the fish species that “walk” on land, including mudskippers9, lungfish12, polypterus8, snakeheads, climbing perch25, and catfishes, do so by using their tail to push their bodies forward, pivoting over the pectoral fins. In Cryptotora, there was no undulation of the tail and body bending occurred primarily between the appendicular girdles, as in salamanders26, as the pectoral and pelvic girdles rotate opposite to each other. Cryptotora used a diagonal-couplets lateral sequence gait that was observed both in video taken in the fish’s natural habitat (in flow speeds of approximately 60 cm/s) and in a glass aquarium tilted to 45° and 90° (Fig. 5B, Supplementary Video 1, 3). This symmetric alternating gait is typically the most stable for tetrapods because the center of mass is supported by the triangular orientation of the limbs 19,26,27, and was characterised by semi-synchronous movement of the right forefin and lefthindfin (RF-LH) followed by semi-synchronous movement of the left forefin and right hindfin (LF-RH). There was no observable difference in kinematics between sequences collected at 45˚ and 90° inclinations. Walking motion appeared to be primarily driven by rotation of the appendicular girdles relative to the long axis of the fish rather than by protraction and retraction of individual fins; however, further analysis of higher resolution video is necessary to test this. Figure 5: Walking kinematics of Cryptotora thamicola climbing a glass surface at a 45 degree angle, ventral view. (A) Midline spline curve from five consecutive step cycles, head is to the right and aligned to same position among frames. (B) stance phase averaged by proportion of step cycle for right forefin (RF, blue), left forefin (LF, green), right hindfin (RH, orange), and left hindfin (LH, purple). The ends of the bars are calculated as mean ± SE touchdown/liftoff for n = 10 step cycles. Boxes at the ends of bars represent 75% confidence intervals. Time zero was designated as the frame where the LH could be seen pushing away from the glass, which was chosen because this motion was consistently observed to happen in a single frame. Full size image A step cycle (i.e. stride) was defined as the amount of time between the push off of the left hindfin (LH), which from the ventral view could be seen to rotate the pelvis to the right, until the next LH push off. The gait duty factor was the proportion of the step cycle in which a fin was in contact with the substrate. The duty factor of Cryptotora was 65% for each fin with no significant difference among fins (F(3,36) = 0.069, p = 0.976). This aquatic walking duty cycle falls between the aquatic and terrestrial modes of the salamander Dicamptodon tenebrosus, for which the gait pattern duty cycle is approximately 41% while submerged and 77% while walking on a treadmill26,28. It has been hypothesized that early tetrapods that could not lift their bodies off the ground would use a crutching29 or walking trot gait, in which the body moved with an undulatory wave, and those that could support their weight would perform a lateral sequence walk, resulting in a standing wave of the axial body19. Cryptotora performs a tetrapodal diagonal-couplets lateral sequence walk with a standing wave but it’s body remains close to the ground, which may be hydrodynamically important when walking in high velocity flow conditions. In reality, the behaviour and morphology of Cryptotora are unique as compared to both swimming fishes and walking salamanders and represent a locomotor strategy that may be heavily constrained by their cave environment. Evolution of walking in fishes Tetrapod locomotion began in the water, where the first limbs were used as paddles30. A hallmark of the evolution of tetrapods is the regionalisation of vertebral column articulations between neural centra and with the pelvic girdle for support out of the buoyant fluid environment19. Indeed, the evolution of the pelvic girdle structure points to development on land21; where it is absolutely essential to have a robust mechanical connection between the axial skeleton and the ground to generate upright walking forces30. In fishes, both living and extinct, the body is supported by the surrounding fluid; pelvic fins are used primarily for stabilization against roll31. A number of researchers have shown that it is possible to use the biomechanical knowledge of extant vertebrates to attempt to better understand the functional constraints that shaped the origin of tetrapod limbs32,33,34,35,36. Even though fish bone is anosteocytic, it has been shown to remodel and reinforce skeletal structures in response to mechanical stress37. This process is known to cause the formation of intermuscular bones in fishes15 and to increase pectoral girdle shape and thickness in polypterus, which walks on land using its pectoral fins8. Thus, the enlarged neuropophyses, ribs, and pelvic girdle of Cryptotora may have evolved as a result of mechanical stressors from climbing and walking. Developmental plasticity plays an important role in the appearance of complex heritable phenotypic traits38,39 and extreme environments, like those in caves, are catalysts for the evolution of novel traits. Standen et al. hypothesized that environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity may facilitate macroevolutionary change8; however, our current data does not allow us discriminate between selection for a robust pelvic girdle specifically or for the plastic response to extreme environmental conditions. Interestingly, the fin shape and footfalls of walking Cryptotora (Fig. 6A) is similar to the patterns of footprints seen in the oldest known Devonian subaqueous tetrapod trackway (382–358 mya; Fig. 6B) from the Genoa River Beds in New South Wales, Australia40. In both cases the pes (hindfin) print overlies the manus (forefin) on the same side33,40. Also, the six or more digit prints at the edges of the trackway prints match the orientation and position of the distal end of fin rays in walking Cryptotora; it is not unreasonable that fin rays digging into a substrate, especially when the fin ray tips are free of webbing as they are in Cryptotora, would create a pattern like digits. No known limbed early tetrapods made such tracks33,41 but they could have been made by a fish that walked like Cryptotora. Similar trackways are known from the Valencia Slate Formation in Ireland and these sediments have an earlier date than the presumed origin of tetrapods as indicated by body fossil data19. Notably, many Homalopterid fishes are able to push their bodies off the substrate and stand perched on their fins1; however, we predict that if Cryptotora were to walk on a soft substrate (which is non-native to its cave environment), it would likely leave a body and tail imprint, like that seen with some of the tracks in the Genoa River Bed40. Figure 6: Finprint comparison. (A) Tracing of Cryptotora fins from ventral view during walking sequence on glass at 45° angle. Final LF (green) fin tracing is shown with fin ray orientations drawn. (B) footprint outlines of earliest known tetrapod trackway from the Devonian, redrawn from Warren and Wakefield40, rotated to match walking direction of Cryptotora (towards top of page), and scaled to similar size (scale bars are 50 mm, bottom). Full size image It is, however, crucial to note that Cryptotora is not an analogous representative of any early tetrapodamorph described to date. Description of the morphological attributes of early tetrapods that were instrumental in the fin to limb transition included the presence of zygapophyses and large neural spines on vertebrae and a pelvic girdle that was firlmly attached to the axial skeleton; Cryptotora convergently evolved these while no other fish has. However, Cryptotora obviously lacks digited appendages, which evolved before the pelvic girdle in the fin-to-limb transition. In the Devonian period, vertebrates gained novel morphological and behavioural traits that facilitated life in a terrestrial environment. Among these, solid-substrate based locomotion, alternating gait by pelvic propulsors, and digit-bearing limbs are considered to be critical adaptations for the emergence of tetrapods12,33,42. Recent works on terrestrial locomotion in fishes have shown that pelvic appendage driven locomotion on a hard surface was possible before the evolution of digited limbs12. Our work supports those findings and goes on to show that fish are capable of evolving a robust pelvic girdle that is firmly attached to the vertebral column in the absence of digited limbs; this finding is especially worth considering given the fossils trackways showing tetrapodal locomotion that predate the origin of digited limbs. While there have been multiple cases of secondarily aquatic vertebrates, we only have fossil evidence of one period of time in which vertebrates emerged from an aquatic lifestyle and evolved terrestrial walking behaviour19. Future studies of extant fishes that convergently evolved morphological and behavioural features typical of tetrapods will offer a window into understanding the biomechanical constraints that enhanced selection on this complex transformation. ||||| When Daphne Soares got back from a trip to Thailand last year, she had something she just had to share with her hallmate at work. “Check out this cool fish I saw!” she said, pulling up a video. Brooke Flammang had never seen anything like the cave fish in Soares’ footage. It was pink. It was eyeless. It had huge fins that looked like two pairs of wings. And it was walking. But it wasn’t the walking that threw her for a loop. Flammang studies fish locomotion at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, so she’s used to seeing fish moving on land. She wasn’t surprised to see one that could push itself over rocks and through water gushing like a fire hose. But other “walking” fish hop forward by leaning on their pectoral fins like a pair of crutches, or flex and shimmy to wriggle over surfaces. This one was taking steps, moving one of its front fins in time with the back fin on the other side of its body, alternating in a diagonal two-step like a salamander. Flammang was incredulous. “I was like, ‘Fish can’t do that,’” she says. “That’s ridiculous.” This one did, though. And a fish that walks like an amphibian, especially when it’s more closely related to a goldfish than to any four-footed creature, could teach biologists a lot about how humans’ fishy ancestors learned how to walk. Intrigued, Flammang asked Soares if she could get a specimen of her own to examine. The answer? “Absolutely not.” It turns out the waterfall-climbing cave fish Cryptotora thamicola is incredibly rare. It lives in just eight caves on the border of Thailand and Myanmar, and the Thai government fiercely protects the small population—fewer than 2,000 adults at last count. Danté Fenolio/Science Source Normally, a biologist studying anatomy and movement would capture some fish from the wild, film how they move in a lab, and dissect a few to figure out how their bones and muscles work together. No such luck with Cryptotora thamicola. If Flammang was going to get a better look at how this fish walked, she was going to have to do it inside the caves where they lived. She would have to study its skeleton without dissecting a single specimen. Only a few years ago, Flammang would’ve been stuck. That awesome video would probably have been all she knew about this novel cavefish. Because even if she could get permission to film in the caves, she would still need a way to see what the fish’s skeleton looked like. And none of the museums that owned preserved specimens were about to let anyone cut into something that rare. “Museum specimens are everybody’s specimens,” says Paul Gignac, a biologist and 3-D imaging specialist at Oklahoma State University. “They’re not things you can sample destructively, especially when they’re very rare specimens that other people may someday need.” Fortunately, Flammang knew something she could do. She started by teaming up with a Thai ichthyologist, Apinun Suvarnaraksha, who was able to get permission to go into the caves and capture fish to film before rereleasing them into the wild. Suvarnaraksha had never collected kinematic data before, so Flammang trained him remotely. “I tried to give him the most explicit instructions I could, then he’d collect a few videos, upload them on Google Drive, and send them to me,” Flammang said. “And I’d notice that we needed a better camera angle, or better backlighting. It went back-and-forth for a couple of months until we got some videos to analyze.” Brooke Flammang Suvarnaraksha also got permission to scan a museum specimen in a high-resolution CT scanner at a local dental school, which gave Flammang the data to build a detailed 3-D model of the fish’s skeleton while leaving the specimen unharmed. Today, they released their results. The videos confirmed that Cryptotora thamicola moves a lot like a salamander, keeping its tail straight as it steps its fins forward, utterly unlike the typical wriggly fish-out-of-water. Their model of its skeleton, published in Scientific Reports, hints at how the fish manages that feat: Its pelvis is fused to its vertebral column, which lets the fish push forces from its limbs directly into its core. Flammang thinks that anatomy is a first for modern fish, though it’s common in terrestrial vertebrates. “When they sent me the files, I thought someone was playing a trick on me,” she says. “There was this gigantic pelvis that looks nothing like any fish pelvis.” It’s a neat bit of convergent evolution that wouldn’t have been discovered before high-resolution consumer camcorders, widespread CT scanners, and remote collaboration via the Internet. Gignac notes that Flammang’s approach is an effective way to pull new data from rare specimens around the world. “CT lets us nondestructively get a much better understanding of their anatomy than we could from just photographing them at a museum. And one of the most important advances it’s given researchers is an ability to work collaboratively in groups all over the world.” A CT scan isn’t quite like holding a fish in your own two hands, but for Flammang, it’s better than nothing. Way better. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The blind waterfall-climbing cave fish, Cryptotora thamicola, may give scientists valuable insights into the evolutionary process that saw some fish start to walk on land.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Arkansas is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Its name is of Siouan derivation from the language of the Osage denoting their related kin, the Quapaw Indians. The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world. - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States. - Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation. - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico. Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - WPRE ( 980 AM ) is a radio station broadcasting a classic hits format to the Prairie du Chien , Wisconsin , USA area . WPRE began as a daytime only station , but now broadcasts at night with reduced power . The station is licensed to Robinson Corporation which is owned by David and Jane Robinson . WPRE has an FM sister station at 94.3 MHz. with the call letters WQPC ( formerly WPRE - FM ) . The transmitter and broadcast tower are located on the west side of Prairie du Chien next to the Mississippi River . According to the Antenna Structure Registration database , the tower is 74 m ( 243 ft ) tall .

The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - Prairie du Chien is a city in and the county seat of Crawford County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 5,911 at the 2010 census. Its Zip Code is 53821. - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - Oldies is a radio format that concentrates on rock and roll and pop music from the latter half of the 20th Century, specifically from around the mid 1950s to the 1970s or 1980s. - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. - Wisconsin is a U.S. state located in the north-central United States, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions. It is bordered by Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to the northeast, and Lake Superior to the north. Wisconsin is the 23rd largest state by total area and the 20th most populous. The state capital is Madison, and its largest city is Milwaukee, which is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The state is divided into 72 counties. - A meander, in general, is a bend in a sinuous watercourse or river. A meander forms when moving water in a stream erodes the outer banks and widens its valley, and the inner part of the river has less energy and deposits silt. A stream of any volume may assume a \\"meandering\\" course, alternately eroding sediments from the outside of a bend and depositing them on the inside. The result is a \\"snaking\\" pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its down-valley axis. When a meander gets cut off from the main stream, an oxbow lake forms. Over time meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes rock and pop music from 1964 to 1988 or 1989, with occasional songs as recent as the early 1990s or before 1995. The term is erroneously used as a synonym for the adult hits format (which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from the 1970s through the 1990s), but is more accurately characterized as a contemporary style of the oldies format, although most classic hits stations focus on pop hits from the late 1960s through the 1990s. - Adult hits (sometimes also called variety hits) is a radio format that draws from a wide variety of different musical genres. Most adult hits stations play a mix of rock, pop, pop rock, soft rock, classic rock, adult contemporary, and new wave hits as well as select oldies hits, predominantly drawing on music from the late 1960s through the present day. Adult hits is akin to classic hits, although the classic hits format uses a slightly older and often narrower playlist (1960s to 1980s). - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770. - Louisiana (or ; Louisiana Creole: \\"Léta de la Lwizyàn\\") is a state located in the southern region of the United States. Louisiana is the 31st most extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States. Its capital is Baton Rouge and largest city is New Orleans. Louisiana is the only state in the U.S. with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are the local government's equivalent to counties. The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish, and the largest by total area is Plaquemines. Louisiana is bordered by Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the east, Texas to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. - Crawford County is a county in the southwest part of the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2010 census, the population was 16,644. Its county seat is Prairie du Chien. - The Mississippi River Delta region is a 3-million-acre (12,000 km) area of land that stretches from Vermillion Bay on the west, to the Chandeleur Islands in the Gulf of Mexico on the southeastern coast of Louisiana. It is part of the Louisiana coastal plain, one of the largest areas of coastal wetlands in the United States. The Mississippi River Delta is the 7th largest river delta on Earth (USGS) and is an important coastal region for the United States, containing more than 2.7 million acres of coastal wetlands (and 37% of the estuarine marsh in the conterminous U.S. he coastal area is the nations largest drainage basin and drains about 41% of the contiguous United States into the Gulf of Mexico at an average rate of 470,000 cubic feet per second. - The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. It once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before naturally occurring erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most roads running east or west. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: x = 5, equation weights = [2, 9, 0] Student:","output":"Yes, I understand the problem. I will now compute the result of the polynomial expression by substituting the given value of x in the given polynomial equation with the provided equation weights. Given equation weights = [2, 9, 0], this represents the polynomial equation: 2x^2 + 9x + 0. Now, we need to substitute x = 5 into the polynomial equation: Result = 2(5)^2 + 9(5) + 0 Result = 2(25) + 45 + 0 Result = 50 + 45 Result = 95 Hence, the result of the given polynomial equation with x = 5 and equation weights = [2, 9, 0] is 95."},{"instruction":"Irina Kulikova (Russian: Ирина Куликова; born 6 August 1991 ) is a Russian fashion model.

Context: In 1979, the U.S. placed Libya on its list of \\"State Sponsors of Terrorism\\", while at the end of the year a demonstration torched the U.S. embassy in Tripoli in solidarity with the perpetrators of the Iran hostage crisis. The following year, Libyan fighters began intercepting U.S. fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean, signalling the collapse of relations between the two countries. Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat. Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising him. The answer to this question is:","output":"Gaddafi sent soldiers into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders in 1979."},{"instruction":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

Adam Hock, has been accused of leaving the 24-year-old prince with a broken jaw and needing hospital treatment after he punched him at Double Seven, a Meatpacking District bar. But Mr Hock has denied he began the brawl and said the prince and his four friends began the trouble in the early hours of Saturday morning. ‘My client was with some very very nice women and Mr","output":"Casiraghi and his friends began harassing them,' said Hock's attorney in a recent statement. 'Adam Hock acted in self-defense and to protect the honor of the women he was with.' Witnesses claim that the confrontation between Hock and Casiraghi escalated when the prince and his friends allegedly insulted the women in Hock's company. According to sources, the situation became more heated as both parties exchanged insults. Despite the scuffle resulting in serious harm to Prince Pierre Casiraghi, Adam Hock maintains his assertion that his actions were warranted given the circumstances. The case is still under investigation, and authorities are gathering additional information and statements from those present at the incident. In the meantime, Adam Hock is currently facing assault charges for the injuries inflicted upon Prince Pierre Casiraghi, whose broken jaw is being treated at a nearby hospital. Step 1: Understand the existing passage and identify the information required to complete it. I understood that the passage is about Adam Hock being accused of assaulting Prince Pierre Casiraghi and claiming self-defense. The passage required further information about the incident and its consequences. Step 2: Logical continuation of the passage. The logical continuation was to describe the altercation, the statements made by Hock's attorney on his behalf, and the consequences of the incident, such as Hock facing assault charges and Prince Casiraghi receiving hospital treatment. Step 3: Justify steps. The selected narrative fills the gaps in the story, further develops the events that took place during the altercation, and discusses its outcomes, resulting in a more comprehensive account of the situation."},{"instruction":"Question: In their pursuit of more money and power, corrupt dictators often ignore what? Is \\"A corrupt dictatorship typically results in many years of general hardship and suffering for the vast majority of citizens as civil society and the rule of law disintegrate.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, that statement is generally accurate. In their pursuit of more money and power, corrupt dictators often ignore the well-being and rights of their citizens, which can result in numerous negative consequences, including the disintegration of civil society and the rule of law. A corrupt dictatorship typically results in many years of general hardship and suffering for the vast majority of citizens as the essential institutions that govern a healthy and functioning society, such as the judiciary, legislature, and press, are weakened or stifled. In the absence of a strong civil society and rule of law, citizens often face rampant corruption, economic mismanagement, human rights abuses, and limited political freedoms. Corruption: Dictators often engage in various corrupt activities to enrich themselves and consolidate their power, such as embezzling public funds, nepotism, or accepting bribes. This corruption can permeate throughout the government, as officials often prioritize personal gain over responsibility to their constituents. This can lead to a lack of resources for public services and infrastructure, further exacerbating the citizens' hardships. Economic Mismanagement: Corrupt dictators often mismanage their nation's resources, either to enrich themselves or to bolster their power. They may divert valuable resources towards the military or extravagant personal projects, rather than investing in education, healthcare, or public infrastructure. This neglect can lead to stagnating economies and widespread poverty. Human Rights Abuses: In their pursuit of power, dictators often employ brutal tactics to maintain control and suppress dissent. This can manifest in the form of extrajudicial killings, unlawful detentions, torture, or widespread surveillance. These human rights abuses create a climate of fear and erode citizens' trust in government institutions. Limited Political Freedoms: Corrupt dictators commonly stifle political dissent and opposition in order to maintain power. This can include enforcing censorship, suppressing protests, or rigging elections. As a result, citizens are often left with limited say in the political process and minimized freedom of expression. In summary, corrupt dictators, in their pursuit of money and power, often ignore the well-being and rights of their citizens, leading to widespread hardship and suffering. The weakening or disintegration of vital societal institutions, such as civil society and the rule of law, can exacerbate the negative consequences, including rampant corruption, economic mismanagement, human rights abuses, and limited political freedoms."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a short poem which is written by a kid.

It was originally formed as a three-month volunteer unit at the beginning of the war, and then reorganized as a three-year unit, in which role it served until the end of the war. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"The 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was recognised as a unit after the start of the war\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was recognized as a unit after the start of the American Civil War. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, it became increasingly necessary to establish organized military units to support the Union Army's efforts. Thus, the 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was formed as a three-month volunteer unit. This formation occurred at the beginning of the war, showing that the regiment's recognition indeed happened post the commencement of the war. However, their role was not limited to these initial three months. As the war continued, it was evident that the conflict wouldn't end swiftly. Hence, the 11th Regiment was reorganized into a three-year unit, highlighting that their service was extended beyond the early stages of the war, catering to the Union’s needs as the war kept unfolding. The unit was recognized based on the requirements of wartime, and it remained functional and involved until the end of the war. Deployed in numerous battles and operations during the Civil War, their recognition was likely reinforced and appreciated over the years, given their extensive service duration. The history and performance of the 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry manifest that their recognition was not only after the start of the war but continued throughout its progress, lasting until the cessation of the hostilities. Therefore, the statement that \\"The 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was recognized as a unit after the start of the war\\" is accurate according to the information provided."},{"instruction":"i uh where i lived uh it was a little town called Newmarket Does it follow that \\"I lived in Newmarket.\\"?

These towns might have their own unique characteristics, history, and community life. Living in a small town often comes with a strong sense of community, where people tend to be well-acquainted with each other, and the pace of life may be more relaxed compared to a big city. You might have experienced local events such as annual festivals, parades, or farmers' markets that brought the community together. The town may have charming architecture, natural attractions, or local landmarks that make it distinctive and memorable. Inhabitants generally appreciate the close-knit nature of the community and the slower pace of life that small towns offer. It is essential to note, however, that the quality of life in a small town such as Newmarket would largely depend on an individual's preferences, lifestyle, and needs. Though small-town living is tremendously appealing to many people, some individuals might prefer the anonymity and excitement of a bustling city. In conclusion, based on your statement, it is accurate to say that \\"I lived in Newmarket.\\" This statement implies that you resided in a small town called Newmarket, which might have given you a chance to become acquainted with a close-knit community and experience the charm of small-town living.

In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947.

The Packers got on the board first with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers to Davante Adams. The Lions responded with a 42-yard field goal from Matt Prater. Green Bay accumulated a big lead with two touchdown catches by Jordy Nelson for eight and later 17 yards, one by Richard Rodgers from two-yards, as well as a 36-yard field goal from Mason Crosby. Detroit made the halftime score 31-10 after Marvin Jones caught a 17-yard touchdown catch from Matthew Stafford. After the break, the Lions attempted a comeback with touchdown catches by Anquan Boldin and Marvin Jones, from two and 45-yards respectively, as well a 50-yard Prater field goal. Despite only allowing a 46-yard Packers field goal in the second half, the Lions came up short, losing 27-34. How many points were scored in the second half of the game?","output":"Alright, little buddy! Let's count the points scored in the second half of the game. The Lions scored two touchdowns, worth 6 points each, so that's 12 points. They also scored a field goal, worth 3 points. So, the Lions scored 15 points in the second half. The Packers scored a field goal, which is worth 3 points. Now, we just add the points together: 15 points for the Lions plus 3 points for the Packers equals 18 points. So, 18 points were scored in the second half of the game."},{"instruction":"Information: - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Melanie Clare Sophie \\"Mel\\" Giedroyc (born 5 June 1968) is an English presenter, actress and comedian, best known for her comedy work with Sue Perkins, co-hosting series including \\"Light Lunch\\" for Channel 4, \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" for the BBC and chat show \\"Mel and Sue\\" for ITV. - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster.

Originally coming to prominence through her comedy partnership with Mel Giedroyc in \\"Mel and Sue\\", she has since become best known as a radio broadcaster and TV presenter, notably of \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" (20102016) and \\"Insert Name Here\\" (2016present). - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time. - The Channel Islands (Norman: \\"Îles d'la Manche\\", French: \\"Îles Anglo-Normandes\\" or \\"Îles de la Manche\\") are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy. They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198 km. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - A double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duothe straight man, feed, dead wood, or stoogeis portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other onethe funny man, banana man or comicis portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term \\"feed\\" comes from the way a straight man is wont to set up jokes and \\"feed\\" them to his partner. - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed.

More recently they have hosted the BAFTA Award - winning BBC One cookery series The Great British Bake Off . - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"I will analyze the linguistic integrity of the sentence by breaking down its components and assessing its overall structure for clarity. Here are the steps: 1. Identify the key elements of the sentence: The main components of the sentence are \\"any student,\\" \\"Mary's class,\\" and \\"happened to vote.\\" 2. Check for grammatical correctness: The sentence uses proper grammar. \\"Any student\\" is the subject, \\"happened to vote\\" is the verb, and \\"Mary's class\\" is a qualifier to provide more context. 3. Evaluate the syntax and structure: The sentence is structured with the subject (any student in Mary's class) followed by the verb (happened to vote). However, the wording and structure make the sentence somewhat unclear. 4. Assess clarity and coherence: \\"Any student in Mary's class happened to vote\\" is not entirely clear or coherent. It is unclear if the sentence is trying to say that every student in Mary's class voted or if it is suggesting that there was at least one student who voted but not necessarily all students. Additionally, using \\"happened to vote\\" adds an element of randomness that may make the statement less specific and more open to interpretation. 5. Offer a suggestion for improving the sentence: To improve the linguistic integrity of the sentence, it would be helpful to rephrase it to be more specific and to provide clearer information about the students in question. For example: - If the intent is to say that every student voted: \\"All students in Mary's class voted.\\" - If the intent is to say that one or more students voted: \\"Some students in Mary's class voted.\\" In conclusion, while the original sentence has some linguistic integrity (i.e., proper grammar), its clarity and coherence are compromised by its ambiguous structure and wording. By rephrasing the sentence to be more specific, the linguistic integrity can be improved."},{"instruction":"You know that friction also causes heat. Think about when you rub your hands together.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"She parked her car on the airport runway every day.\\" - Sentence B: \\"She parked her car in her garage.\\" Please answer this question gradually:","output":"To determine which sentence is nonsensical, let's analyze both sentences step-by-step: Sentence A: \\"She parked her car on the airport runway every day.\\" 1. First, we consider the action: parking a car on an airport runway. Normally, airport runways are reserved for aircraft takeoffs and landings. 2. Parking a car on a runway may be a security and safety risk, as it could interfere with the proper functioning of the airport. 3. Given the unusual and potentially hazardous nature of this action, it seems unlikely that someone would be allowed to park their car on a runway every day. 4. Hence, this sentence can be considered nonsensical, as it describes a situation that is not plausible or logical under normal circumstances. Sentence B: \\"She parked her car in her garage.\\" 1. This sentence involves parking a car in a garage, which is a common and typical action. 2. Garages are usually designed for parking cars and thus are intended for this purpose. 3. There are no implausible actions or situations described in this sentence. 4. Consequently, this sentence is not nonsensical, as it describes a logical and ordinary situation.

The statement \\"In 2003, the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the Bizere Monastery near the River Mureş in present-day Romania\\" does not correctly answer the question of \\"when the mosaics at Bizere Monastery were created.\\" This statement only provides information about the year in which the remains of the mosaic were discovered, not when they were created. To offer a comprehensive response, it's essential to briefly introduce the historical context and the significance of the Bizere Monastery. The Bizere Monastery, known since the 12th century, was a medieval Benedictine abbey situated in the Arad County of present-day Romania. It played a vital role in the region's spiritual and cultural development. However, multiple invasions and destructions ultimately led to its ruin. Now, regarding the mosaics, when they were discovered in 2003, researchers and archaeologists conducted thorough analyses and studies to estimate their age and historical importance. Through these examinations, the experts were able to determine that these beautifully detailed Byzantine-style mosaic pavements date back to the 12th century. This period matches the early development and existence of the Bizere Monastery. Thus, the mosaics' creation can be estimated to have taken place during the 12th century. In summary, the statement provided indicates the year of the mosaics' discovery at the Bizere Monastery, not the time of their creation.

In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the American album chart, and Rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees (1975), followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune (1976), containing the hit single \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts. Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album.

Please answer step by step:","output":"Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not a sonnet, and converting it into one would be challenging. Here are some reasons why and a step-by-step analysis of what it would take to transform it into a sonnet: 1. Length: A sonnet is a 14-line poem, while Rime of the Ancient Mariner is significantly longer, consisting of seven parts and hundreds of lines. To convert it into a sonnet, you would need to condense the entire story into just 14 lines. 2. Meter and rhyme: A sonnet usually follows a specific rhythmic pattern, such as iambic pentameter (a line consisting of five pairs of unstressed and stressed syllables), and a consistent rhyme scheme. Rime of the Ancient Mariner, on the other hand, has an inconsistent meter and rhyme, meaning you would have to adjust the entire poem to fit the requirements of a sonnet. 3. Structure: A sonnet often follows a specific structure. For example, a Shakespearean sonnet is generally made up of three quatrains (four-line stanzas) and a final couplet (a pair of rhyming lines). Each section contributes to a central theme or argument. Rime of the Ancient Mariner is more narrative in structure, with no such divisions or a single focus. 4. Theme and content: Sonnets are usually focused on a single theme or emotional experience, while Rime of the Ancient Mariner tells a complex story dealing with multiple themes, such as sin, guilt, redemption, and nature. Condensing the story and its themes into a sonnet's limitations would weaken the poem's depth and impact. In summary, transforming Rime of the Ancient Mariner into a sonnet would involve: 1. Reducing the poem's length to 14 lines. 2. Adopting a consistent meter (i.e., iambic pentameter) and rhyme scheme. 3. Restructuring the poem to fit the sonnet form. 4. Streamlining the story and themes to fit within the sonnet's limitations. While it is possible to create a sonnet inspired by Rime of the Ancient Mariner, capturing the entirety of the original poem in sonnet form would be challenging and would sacrifice much of its narrative richness and thematic complexity."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: pray, religion, wail, wall","output":"Step 1: Identify the key concepts - pray, religion, wail, and wall. Step 2: Determine a logical connection between the concepts. - Pray: Praying is a common practice in many religions. - Religion: Religions often have specific locations or symbols which followers associate with their practices or beliefs. - Wail: Wailing can be associated with lamentation or expressing deep sorrow, which can also be related to certain religious practices or expressions of faith. - Wall: Walls act as a physical barrier, but in the context of religion could also be symbolic or part of a religious structure. Step 3: Establish a context or situation that includes all of the above concepts.

I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules. Today all soccer teams play by them. Soccer is called \\"football\\" everywhere but in the United States. The game is played mostly with feet. No players except the goalie ( ) may touch the ball with their hands. They may control the ball with any part of the body except their hands. Soccer is by far the world's most popular sport.

Choices: - recorder - tape - i would write it on paper if possible.. - documentation of facts - spell checker The rationale to choose \\"recorder\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The option \\"recorder\\" is the most accurate choice for recording something among the given choices for several reasons. These reasons range from the practical aspects of using a recorder to its efficiency and versatility. Here is a detailed explanation to support the rationale for selecting \\"recorder\\" as the answer: 1. Technological functionality: A recorder, whether it is a digital voice recorder or a mobile app, is specifically designed to capture and store audio data. It allows users to clearly and accurately record voices, conversations, or other sounds during meetings, lectures, interviews, and various other settings. This advantage makes it an ideal tool for recording something in a reliable manner. 2. Ease of use: Modern recorders are often user-friendly and can be operated with minimal technical knowledge. Most recorders have a simple interface with buttons such as \\"record,\\" \\"play,\\" \\"stop,\\" and \\"delete\\" that make it easy to record and manage recordings. This intuitive design allows users to capture important information quickly and efficiently. 3. Portability: Recorders are often small, lightweight, and easy to transport or carry along in various situations. This portability ensures that you can have a means of recording something with you at all times, making it a practical choice for various environments and situations. 4. High-quality audio: Recorders, particularly digital ones, can provide a high-quality audio recording with clear and crisp sound. This ensures that the recorded information is easily understandable and can be listened to multiple times or shared with others for analysis or reference. 5. Time-stamped organization: Some recorders allow users to categorize and organize recorded files with time stamps or labels. This organizational feature helps users easily locate specific recordings when needed, making the entire process more efficient. 6. Digital storage and sharing: Most modern recorders offer digital storage solutions, including internal memory or removable SD cards, as well as USB or wireless transfer options for downloading or sharing the recordings. This makes it easy to store and access the recorded data for future reference or even share it with other individuals. In comparison, the alternative options are not as suitable for recording something: - Tape: While a tape can be used to record something, it’s an outdated technology and presents several limitations in terms of audio quality, storage capacity, and accessibility. - Writing on paper: This method has its own merit but is not efficient for recording live events, as it can be difficult to keep up with the information being shared. Moreover, it is prone to human error and may not capture all of the details. - Documentation of facts: This choice is more about organizing or presenting information rather than recording it. Using a recorder would be more beneficial in capturing data accurately before organizing or documenting it. - Spell checker: This option is unrelated to recording something and is more focused on correcting spelling mistakes in written text. Because of these reasons, the sensible rationale is to choose \\"recorder\\" as the best option for recording something among the given alternatives. Its advanced features, ease of use, portability, and organizational capabilities make it the most appropriate and efficient choice for accurately capturing various types of information."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story. The cat peed in the bedroom a lot while the dog never did.","output":"The sun had barely erupted over the horizon with its usual ethereal orange glow when Jane, a woman in her mid-thirties, woke up to a rather unpleasant smell. Despite several notches of the alarm clock away from ringing, she couldn't help but get out of bed, her curiosity piqued by the sudden awakening of her olfactory nerves. With a groan and a heavy sigh, she realized the source of the unwelcome stench – the cat had peed in the bedroom again. Placing her hazy, sleep-ridden thoughts on pause, Jane looked around the bedroom to find the culprit – Fluffy, a temperamental Siamese with piercing blue eyes and uncanny stealth capabilities. The vision of last week's stain on the artwork of her precious Persian rug flashed before her eyes, fueling the dread that had begun to claw at her insides. It seemed that Fluffy had developed a distaste for her litter box and an inexplicable love for peeing all over the bedroom, creating a rather uncomfortable, tenuous situation for the family. She glanced over at her dog, Buster, a well-trained Golden Retriever with a heart of gold, who had managed to sleep through the whole ordeal. Buster never once had any accidents in the house, which only added to Jane's frustration with Fluffy's persistent episodes of insubordination. Buster had somehow picked up on his owner's discontent; he woke with a start, his tail wagging as if to console Jane during this trying time. His loyalty and good behavior only magnified her vexation over Fluffy's unruly actions. Resigned to the fact that cleaning the mess was the only way to embark on the day fully, Jane groggily lumbered over to the cleaning supplies cupboard in the hallway. Swiftly, she grabbed a handful of paper towels, a bottle of disinfectant spray, and an old towel she had reserved for such scenarios, not that she was particularly eager to deal with them. As Buster sympathetically watched Jane, he wondered how he could help. Deep down, he sensed that something had to be done about Fluffy's newly-developed habit soon. The day wore on, and although Jane managed to restore some semblance of order to the room, the vexing memory of the morning's events rested heavily on her mind. Quite at her wit's end, she decided to pay a visit to the local veterinarian and cat behaviorist, Dr. Adams, in the hopes of uncovering the root of Fluffy's uncharacteristic behavior. During the consultation, Dr. Adams inquired about recent changes in their household that might be contributing to Fluffy's newfound rebellion. After a lengthy conversation and thorough examination of the cat's health, Dr. Adams concluded that stress might be the primary reason for Fluffy's unintended artwork. Jane, recalling a recent move to a new neighborhood and the impact it had on the family, couldn't deny that it might have taken a toll on Fluffy as well. Armed with advice from Dr. Adams and a newfound understanding of her cat's emotional needs, Jane set about creating a peaceful and harmonious environment for her pets. She set up additional litter boxes in quieter, low-traffic areas of the house and introduced a pheromone diffuser to help Fluffy feel more at ease. Jane also made sure to provide both Fluffy and Buster with plenty of affection and attention to quell any feelings of anxiety or displacement that might have arisen during their move. Over the weeks that followed, the tension in the household gradually eased away. Fluffy, now more comfortable in her new home, ceased her destructive tendencies, much to Jane's relief. Buster, ever the loyal and supportive companion, resumed his role as the epitome of good behavior. It wasn't long before the family found itself settling into a comfortable routine, basking in the warmth of their love for one another, and united by the bond that transcended their differences – even those of a mischievous Siamese cat and a well-mannered Golden Retriever."},{"instruction":"In this task the focus is on physical knowledge about the world.

The outcome should be a vegan alternative to chicken nuggets. 3. The process may include moving objects, arranging them, mixing, shaking, etc. Solution: Step 1: Gather ingredients and materials - Vegan Protein Source (e.g., tofu, tempeh, or seitan) - Seasonings (e.g., salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika) - Flour (all-purpose or gluten-free) - Plant milk (e.g., almond milk, soy milk) - Breadcrumbs (regular or gluten-free) - Oil (for frying or baking) - Bowls or containers for mixing - A cutting board and knife - A tray for breaded nuggets - A pan or baking sheet Step 2: Prepare the vegan protein - Cut the vegan protein source (tofu, tempeh, or seitan) into small, nugget-sized pieces. - Press the tofu, if using, to remove excess water. Step 3: Mix the seasonings - In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. Step 4: Set up the dipping station - Set up three bowls in a row: one for flour, one for plant milk, and one for breadcrumbs mixed with half of the seasonings. - Arrange the bowls in the order of flour, plant milk, and breadcrumbs. Step 5: Bread the nuggets - Take a nugget-sized piece of the vegan protein and dip it into the flour, evenly coating it. - Then, dip the coated protein into the plant milk, ensuring that the entire surface is wet. - Finally, dip it into the seasoned breadcrumb mixture, pressing the breadcrumbs onto the protein to ensure they stick properly. - Place the breaded nugget onto a tray or plate and repeat the process for all remaining nugget pieces. Step 6: Cook the nuggets - If frying, heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, place nuggets in the pan without overcrowding them. Fry for about 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. - If baking, preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Lightly grease a baking sheet and place the breaded nuggets onto the sheet. Spray the nuggets with a little oil or cooking spray. Bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy. Step 7: Serve - Once the vegan nuggets are cooked, let them cool slightly and then serve with your choice of dipping sauces, such as ketchup, barbecue sauce, or vegan mayonnaise. In this solution, I used the given guidelines by involving physical motions with objects (cutting, mixing, dipping, and cooking), creating a vegan alternative to chicken nuggets using a vegan protein source, and incorporating various mixing and arranging techniques in the process."},{"instruction":"Given the following context: Sally and Humphrey have just put a down payment on a house, when Sally loses her receptionist job after accidentally destroying the switchboard.

Early this week, Cleveland Browns tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. revealed that staph (short for Staphylococcus) infection had sent him to the Cleveland Clinic for three days, and he accused the Browns of asking him to cover it up. Pro football teams are notoriously reluctant to reveal any information on player injuries, but since six different Browns have caught the bug since 2005  Winslow has had it twice  the team's medical management looked suspect to some observers. \\"There's obviously a problem [with staph] and we have to fix it,\\" Winslow told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. \\"Just look at the history around here. It's unfortunate, because it happens time and time again.\\" The Browns, who denied that they had kept the news of his infection from his teammates, suspended Winslow one game for his rant, which included his claim that he felt like he had been treated like \\"a piece of meat.\\" But the Winslow medical controversy wasn't even the worst of it for the league. In the past week, it has become clear that two of its most marketable stars, marquee quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, had gotten infections. The New England Patriots' Brady has had at least two additional infection-related procedures since his initial season-ending knee surgery in September. It's now possible that his knee will have to undergo another operation, which could delay his return until 2010. Staph seems to be the likely culprit, but neither Brady nor the Patriots will confirm that. During training camp staph infected a bursa sac, which acts as a cushion between bones, in Manning's left knee. The infection required surgery and forced him to miss most of the preseason. Though the Colts released a statement on Friday insisting Manning didn't contract a more perilous staph, the anti-biotic resistant strain known as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), the incidents should alarm the NFL. \\"The NFL, and all the leagues, should be diligent, and not let their guards down,\\" says Dr. Robert Gotlin, director of Orthopedic and Sports Rehabilitation at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. \\"They've got to do better. It's got to be one of the top five priorities.\\" The recent cases have certainly gotten players' attention. \\"I'm concerned, and wondering why it's happening. It's not some little infection that goes away in a few days, it's pretty serious,\\" says Chicago Bears rookie running back Matt Forte. The league is quick to point out that it has partnered with teams to educate players about the bacteria, while the players' union insists it's alarmed and has contacted the league about further action. Some teams, like the Colts, have posted pictures on training room walls that warn players about staph symptoms and how to avoid contracting or spreading it. For their part, the Browns note that the team has previously used a special anti-staph agent to disinfect the locker room, weight room and other places where players gather. Staph, of course, is far from just an NFL problem. Two college teams, the '05 Florida Gators and the '03 USC Trojans, had multiple cases. And football is by no means the only sports victim. The infection kept Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Alex Rios out of the 2006 All-Star Game. A few days later another Toronto player caught it, and the clubhouse was disinfected. NBA players Paul Pierce, Grant Hill and Drew Gooden have had it. Staph killed a high school wrestler in California this summer, and last spring 15 students at a Pennsylvania high school were either treated for staph or symptoms caused by the virus. What exactly are staph infections? Staph is bacteria carried on the skin, which can enter the body through a cut or during a medical procedure, causing the infection. Most are minor, but certain strains are particularly resistant to anti-biotics and can cause athletes to miss significant playing time. Athletes are more likely to suffer cuts, and the locker room setting bunches players close to one another in a warm, damp environment, so they are especially susceptible to spreading the bacteria. Since football teams carry some 55 players on their rosters, and tend to have a higher degree of serious injuries to deal with, they are at particular risk. According to a 2005 survey by the NFL Team Physicians Society, 13 out of 30 teams that responded had had a player contract MRSA in recent years, for a total of 60 leaguewide infections. Though Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Omar Gaither rightly points out that \\"we're just a naturally dirty sport,\\" there are several basic precautions athletes can take to lower the chance of catching an infection. Many athletes shave their ankles, legs, and arms because they don't want athletic tape ripping hair off their bodies, but experts say they should lose the razor. \\"No matter how careful the shaving is, you can have nicks and microscopic cuts in the skin,\\" says Dr. Daniel Sexton, an infectious disease specialist at the Duke University Medical Center, who consults for an NFL team and several college programs. \\"Any time you break that barrier, it becomes a portal through which bacteria can gain access.\\" Staph prevention is pretty low-tech. \\"You know, this is pretty simple,\\" Sexton says. \\"Hand washing remains the primary defense against the transmissions of most organisms, including staph. Most people don't think of a locker room as a place where hand hygiene is important, but locker rooms are also mini-emergency rooms.\\" In 2003, a team of researchers tracked the St. Louis Rams and found five players who caught eight MRSA infections. \\"We observed a lack of regular access to hand hygiene (i.e., soap and water or alcohol-based hand gels) for trainers who provided wound care,\\" they wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. Other offenses included \\"skipping of showers by players before the use of communal whirlpools; and sharing or towels  all factors that might facilitate the transmission of infection in this setting.\\" In short: use a little common sense, tough guys. But when it comes to infectious germs, even a 245-lb. bruiser like Gaither believes you can't always outrun them. \\"You can't worry about it to death,\\" he says. \\"It's not like you can walk around and put gloves on your hand every 10 seconds. Sometimes, there's just not that much you can do.\\" Except hope that these recent cases are a coincidental hiccup, and not an epidemic that seriously tackles the NFL. (See pictures of the week here.) What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a sudden slew of staph infections (short for Staphylococcus) affecting NFL players in the game, causing them to miss significant playing time. The article highlights several high-profile players who have been infected, such as Kellen Winslow Jr., Tom Brady, and Peyton Manning. It discusses the concerns of players and league officials, as well as the steps being taken to educate athletes about the bacteria and prevention measures.

Options: - backpack - table - jar - box - container Please answer and provide answer explanation.","output":"I would recommend carrying food in a backpack while on a long walk in the countryside. Answer explanation: - Backpack: A backpack is the most practical option, as it allows you to comfortably carry food along with other essential items. The weight will be evenly distributed on your back, causing minimal inconvenience while walking. - Table: A table is not suitable for carrying food on a walk, as it is impractical and too heavy to carry along. - Jar: A jar can be used to store food, but it may be cumbersome to carry if there is no suitable container such as a backpack to store it in. Additionally, jars can be fragile and may break easily. - Box: A box may work for carrying food, but it can be uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time. It can also take up space and may not fit well into a backpack. - Container: A container can be used to store food, but it still needs to be placed inside a backpack or bag for a comfortable and practical carrying method during the walk. Overall, a backpack is the most convenient and practical method for carrying food during a long walk in the countryside. You may use containers or jars inside the backpack for further organization and protection of your food items."},{"instruction":"– Elon Musk promised to have the job done in 100 days or it's free. Well, it looks like Australia will be paying up. Tesla has completed installation of the world's biggest lithium ion battery in South Australia and will be turning it on next week, ahead of a Dec. 1 deadline, reports the Guardian. The 100-megawatt battery is connected to a wind farm run by French company Neoen and will store renewable energy in an effort to prevent blackouts like those that have affected the country's \\"most wind power-dependent state\\" over the last year, per Reuters. South Australia Premier Jay Weatherill says it still needs to undergo testing but will be ready for Australia's summer, which officially begins on Dec. 1. South Australia is now \\"a leader in renewable energy with battery storage,\\" Weatherill says in a statement. \\"An enormous amount of work has gone in to delivering this project in such a short time.\\" Musk agrees. \\"Congratulations to the Tesla crew and South Australian authorities who worked so hard to get this manufactured and installed in record time!\\" he wrote in a Wednesday tweet. The battery in Jamestown—which will \\"store enough energy to power 30,000 homes for an hour,\\" reports the BBC—is estimated to have cost 50 million, per Engadget. It's part of South Australia's 390 million energy plan that also includes diesel-fired generators and support for a solar thermal power plant at Port Augusta. Expand this summary.","output":"Elon Musk and his company, Tesla, have successfully installed the world's biggest lithium ion battery in South Australia. It's a big battery, almost like an incredibly large version of the one you might find in a toy car or remote control, but much, much bigger! It's even connected to a wind farm, which is like a farm but instead of growing fruits or vegetables, it generates power using wind. The wind farm is run by a French company named Neoen. This big battery is actually very important because it's going to store energy that's made in a way that's good for our planet, like wind power, and help prevent blackouts. Blackouts are like when you accidentally turn off the light switch, but instead of just one room going dark, it's many houses and buildings that lose power all at the same time and this can last for a long time. The South Australia Premier, Jay Weatherill, who's like the leader of South Australia, said the battery just needs a bit of testing, kind of like how a new toy needs testing to make sure it works right. But, he assures that it'll be ready for Australia's summer, which begins on December 1st. What's also amazing is that Musk and his team were able to finish this project very fast. Elon Musk even promised that he and his team would finish the battery within 100 days or it would be given to Australia for free. But they did it! And in less than 100 days, so Australia had to pay for it after all. The battery will be able to supply power to around 30,000 homes for an hour. That's like hooking up every TV, fridge, air conditioner and other electrical things in 30,000 homes to this battery and it would keep them running for one whole hour! This gigantic battery did cost a lot of money, around 50 million, but it's a part of South Australia's big plan to get more energy in a good way for our planet. This plan also includes generators that are run on diesel - it's kind of like the generators' food, and support for a giant solar power plant at Port Augusta. The solar power plant is like a field of large mirrors that catch sunlight and turn it into energy."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: If California were not already so famous for Sillicon Valley and Hollywood, it might be well-known for the groups of water-technology firms in its San Diego County. The reverse-osmosis (RO) spiral module, the technique that supports turning seawater and waste-water into drinkable stuff, began in San Diego in 1964. Today dozens of firms in the area supply many of the world's approximately 13,000 RO plants in places from the Persian Gulf and Israel to Australia and China. Southern California itself, however, has not so far been a big user of its own technology. This is surprising, given that the whole American south-west faces a water problem. But now as the climate gets warmer and the population increases, there is more agreement that the existing infrastructure, consisting of vast pipes that carry water from the Sacramento Delta in the north and the Colorado River in the east, will not be enough. In places such as San Diego, which has inadequate and salty groundwater and currently imports 90% or its water, the answers must be greater conservation, reusing as much water as possible, and getting most of the rest from the sea. The first part, conservation, has been widely accepted by the public. San Diego today uses less water with a larger population than it did in 1989, the year water consumption peaked. The second part, water recycling has been a hard sell, because of an unpleasant factor. Americans still use the term \\"toilet-to-tap\\" for recycling, even though properly treated waste-water is nowadays completely clean. Singapore made its programme acceptable in part by renaming it as NEWater. This is where desalination comes in, which means taking the salt out of salt water. A firm called Poseidon Resources is now close to building the biggest desalination plant in America behind a power station by the beach in Carlsbad. The power plant sucks in 304m gallons of seawater a day for cooling, so Poseidon plans to change 104m gallons a day by using the RO spiral module. Lots of people like the idea. Once fully...

Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did native Haiti Jean-Claude lose his hand?\\" is \\"He was thrown out\\"?","output":"No, sweetie, that's not correct. Jean-Claude Joseph did not lose his hand, but he lost the use of his left arm. This happened when he was attacked by a bad person with a big knife called a \\"machete\\" during a robbery attempt in his home country called Haiti. He got hurt while trying to protect himself from the attack."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"While Coz preaches decorum, the Globe has added more sensationalism, more gore, more nasty gossip.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The Globe is a disgusting piece of media garbage.\\" is true (see options)? A. yes; B. it is not possible to tell; C. no;","output":"Based on the given premise \\"While Coz preaches decorum, the Globe has added more sensationalism, more gore, more nasty gossip,\\" it can be inferred that the Globe differs from Coz, particularly in their approach to content and tone. However, concluding that the hypothesis \\"The Globe is a disgusting piece of media garbage\\" is true requires a more comprehensive analysis of various factors, including the Globe’s journalistic practices, its target audience, ethical standards, and the impact of its content on the public. While the premise suggests that the Globe tends to focus on sensationalism, gore, and nasty gossip, this does not automatically make it a disgusting piece of media garbage. Sensationalism can sometimes be a strategy to capture the attention of an audience, and it might attract readers who enjoy such content. It is important to remember that people have different preferences for media content, and what may be offensive to some may be entertaining or informative to others. The Globe could potentially cater to an audience that appreciates or seeks out such content. However, this approach does raise questions about ethical journalism, which emphasizes accuracy, balance, and fair reporting. Sensationalism, gore, and nasty gossip often prioritize shock value and click-worthy headlines over these journalistic principles. If the Globe consistently eschews ethics in its coverage and primarily focuses on creating controversy for the sake of profit, it may be possible to argue that the publication veers towards being a \\"disgusting piece of media garbage.\\" Nevertheless, it is also essential to consider the publication's entire body of work, including any instances where it may have provided accurate, balanced, and informative content to its readers. Instances of responsible journalism should not be disregarded when evaluating the publication as a whole. In conclusion, based solely on the given premise, it is not possible to definitively confirm or reject the hypothesis that \\"The Globe is a disgusting piece of media garbage.\\" To reach a fair conclusion, a more exhaustive evaluation of the publication's content, journalistic practices, target audience, and overall impact on the public must be undertaken.

Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Review: Bad Actors, bad filming, choppy dialog, shallow characters, but then again it was a bad premise in the first place. Basically, an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house, cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges. Preston Blake is an annoying, obnoxious, boy, who decides that, when written a blank check by a complete stranger, he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can. In other words, he wanders into a bank, hands a teller a check he makes in his printer, and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash. Preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle, due to the fact that a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed could not catch him, even when Preston jumped a row of cars.Of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroine. In this case our hot heroine is a child molesting FBI agent who dates the eleven year old Preston, and promises another date when he turns 17. However, the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting, nor its sloppy dialog, such as \\"The only other way I could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur\\". It was, rather, the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the FBI does not give a damn about random people . What I have failed to explain is that Preston uses the alias \\"Macintosh\\" to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts. Of course, the FBI finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her to hamburgers, finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground. Our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the FBI is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to Preston's limousine, complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on.Overall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film.

A:","output":"The last step of the process after the coal has been loaded onto a truck would likely involve transporting the coal to its final destination, such as a coal processing plant, power plant, or port for export. This step is vital as it ensures that the mined coal is put to effective use, whether it is for electricity generation or other industrial applications. Once the coal reaches its destination, it may undergo further processing, cleaning, and preparation before it is consumed or sold. At the coal processing plant, the coal may be crushed and sized to remove any impurities, such as rock and soil particles. This process is essential to improve the coal's quality and ensure it meets the required standards for specific applications. For instance, when used for electricity generation, the coal must have a specific energy content and particle size to burn efficiently in power plant boilers. Similarly, coal used in steel production must meet specific requirements on impurities, ash, and sulfur content. Once the coal is processed and cleaned, it can be transported to facilities that use coal as a primary energy source. For example, power plants generate electricity by burning the coal to produce steam, which drives turbines and generates electrical power. In the case of coal used for steel production, it is transformed into coke – a fuel with few impurities and high carbon content - and used in blast furnaces to create pig iron, a key ingredient in steelmaking. For coal designated for export, it may be transported to a nearby port facility, where it is loaded onto cargo ships or barges for shipment to customers around the world. The coal can be exported either as a raw material or after undergoing preliminary processing, depending on the preferences and requirements of the importing countries. Once the coal is consumed or sold, the lifecycle process will start again, with more coal mined from the earth, transported, processed, and used to meet the world's energy and industrial needs. The entire process highlights the importance of efficient and environmentally responsible mining, transportation, and utilization practices to ensure the sustainability and minimize the environmental impact of coal's production and consumption."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Accessory components such as mechanical interlocking can be arranged at both ends.\\" said in German?","output":"To translate the phrase \\"Accessory components such as mechanical interlocking can be arranged at both ends.\\" into German, I will follow these steps: 1.

Fruit bodies of several \\"Auricularia\\" species are cultivated for food on a commercial scale, especially in China. - The Sebacinales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes. Taxa have a widespread distribution and are mostly terrestrial, many forming mycorrhizas with a wide variety of plants, including orchids. The order is monotypic, containing a single family, the Sebacinaceae. There are 8 genera and 29 species in the family. - Jaapiales is an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes (subclass Agaricomycetidae). It was first described in 2010 to contain Jaapia, a genus of resupinate species that were until then classified in the order Boletales. Molecular phylogenetics analysis showed it to be a sister group (one of two clades resulting from the splitting of a single lineage) to the rest of the Agaricomycetidae. - The Agaricomycetes are a class of fungi in the division Basidiomycota. The taxon is roughly identical to that defined for the Homobasidiomycetes (alternatively called holobasidiomycetes) by Hibbett & Thorn, with the inclusion of Auriculariales and Sebacinales. It includes not only mushroom-forming fungi, but also most species placed in the deprecated taxa Gasteromycetes and Homobasidiomycetes. Within the subdivision Agaricomycotina, which already excludes the smut and rust fungi, the Agaricomycetes can be further defined by the exclusion of the classes Tremellomycetes and Dacrymycetes, which are generally considered to be jelly fungi. However, a few former \\"jelly fungi\\", such as \\"Auricularia\\", are classified in the Agaricomycetes. According to a 2008 estimate, Agaricomycetes include 17 orders, 100 families, 1147 genera, and about 21000 species. Modern molecular phylogenetic analyses have been since used to help define several new orders in the Agaricomycetes: Amylocorticiales, Jaapiales, Stereopsidales, and Lepidostromatales. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Tremellomycetes are a class of dimorphic fungi. Some species have a gelatinous fruiting body or a sacculate parenthesome. There are 3 orders, 11 families, 50 genera, and 377 species in the Tremellomycetes. - Auricularia is a genus of jelly fungi in the family Auriculariaceae. Preliminary phylogenetic studies suggest the Exidiaceae is closely related to Auriculariaceae, the two share many morphological traits. Fruitbody either resupinate or pileate and then either ear-to shell-shaped or forming narrow, imbricate brackets, flabby elastic or tough gelatinous; hymenial surface smooth, wrinkled or veined, often purplish. Basidia cylindrical, with 1-3 transeverse septa. Spores narrowly ellipsoid to allantoid, hyaline, smooth. Most \\"Auricularia\\" species are edible and are grown commercially. \\"Auricularia\\" species are widely distributed in the Western Ghats, Kerala and recently, \\"Auricularia auricula-judae\\", \\"A. polytricha\\" and \\"A. mesenterica\\" have been reported. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - The Dacrymycetes are a class consisting of only one family of jelly fungi, which has imperforate parenthesomes and basidia that are usually branched. There are 9 genera and 101 species in the Dacrymycetaceae family. - The Boletales are an order of Agaricomycetes containing over 1300 species with a diverse array of fruiting body types . The boletes are the best known members of this group , and until recently , the Boletales were thought to only contain boletes . The Boletales are now known to contain distinct groups of agarics , gasteromycetes , and other fruiting - body types . - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - The subdivision Agaricomycotina, also known as the hymenomycetes, is one of three taxa of the fungal division Basidiomycota (fungi bearing spores on basidia). The Agaricomycotina contain some 20,000 species, and about 98% of these are in the class Agaricomycetes, which comprises most of the fungi known as mushrooms, including the bracket fungi and puffballs. Species in the Agaricomycotina that are not Agaricomycetes include the jelly fungi, certain \\"yeasts\\", ear fungi, and others; these are gathered together as the classes Tremellomycetes and Dacrymycetes.

Corbis T een pregnancy pays... at least if you're Bristol Palin. According to tax documents, the unwed mother and eldest daughter of Sarah Palin raked in more than 262,500 last year working to promote teen abstinence for The Candie's Foundation. Meanwhile, the same foundation distributed only 35,000 in grants to health and counseling clinics for pregnant teens. Is Bristol's big payday bigger than it should have been? Yes, this is outrageous opportunism: It seems Bristol has \\"learned a great deal from her mother,\\" namely \\"how to milk her celebrity status for all it's worth,\\" says E.D. Kain in Forbes. By my calculations, for every dollar that Bristol's promotional efforts funnelled into deserving causes, she earned 7.50 for herself. I know the non-profit industry has its issues, but I'm surprised to see some \\"so blatantly abuse their position at a supposed charity.\\" \\"Non-profit pays Bristol Palin 262,500, donates only 35,000 to charity\\" No, this is par for the course: \\"Before you cry foul over Palin's paycheck,\\" consider that other celeb spokespeople for Candie's Foundation include Hillary Duff, Fergie, and Ciara, and \\"it's doubtful that any of them are doing it for less than a quarter mil,\\" says Megan Angelo at Business Insider. Besides, if you're outraged over what Sarah's daughter pulled in last year, just wait till you see her tax returns for 2010 and 2011, when she appeared on \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and signed a deal to write her memoir, respectively. \\"You might as well get used to the age of Bristol.\\" \\"Bristol Palin is making more money than you talking about teen pregnancy\\" Well, at least give her credit for being industrious: \\"Setting aside the debate about her ability to... actually make a difference in the lives of others, she certainly struck while the timing was right,\\" says Ryan Hamilton Jr. at Gather. While it's perhaps shocking that Bristol made so much money, it's also \\"quite impressive\\" that she'll be able to provide a nice life for her young son. \\"This just goes to show that there are definitely opportunities out there for people who don't finish high school.\\" \\"Bristol Palin salary huge for teen pregnancy work\\" ||||| In this July 25, 2009, photo, former Alaska Gov.

(Associated Press) In this July 25, 2009, photo, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol Palin holds her and Levi Johnston's son Tripp Johnston at the governor's picnic in Anchorage, Alaska. Tax documents show... (Associated Press) Bristol Palin was well worth the 332,500 she was paid to be an ambassador for a foundation aiming to prevent teen pregnancy, the organization's founder said Wednesday. In her 2009 debut with The Candies Foundation, the unwed mother and daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was paid 262,500 for 15 to 20 days of work, and another 70,000 for a less amount of work last year. The money spent has been \\"an amazing investment,\\" according to foundation founder Neil Cole. The fact that the 20-year-old Bristol Palin was a teen mother herself shows the problem is a national epidemic, not one limited to inner cities or minorities, Cole said. Her work advocating abstinence through public service announcements, media interviews and TV and radio spots amounts to more than a billion impressions on people, he said, citing a study conducted by the foundation. \\"Someone said in our organization today, Bristol's the gift that keeps on giving,\\" he said. Palin family attorney John Tiemessen did not immediately return requests for comment Wednesday. Bristol Palin was 18 when she took the job with the New York-based foundation in 2009, months after giving birth to son, Tripp. She and the boy's father, Levi Johnston, are no longer together. Her pregnancy was announced days after Sen. John McCain picked her mother to be his Republican vice presidential running mate in 2008. Bristol Palin told The Associated Press last year she \\"wasn't prepared at all\\" for the dramatic changes in her life since giving birth in December 2008. \\"It changes literally every aspect of your life, and if girls realized how hard it was to be a teen mom, they would think twice about having sex without the proper education and proper knowledge,\\" she said. Palin is no longer on the payroll, but she remains a friend of the organization, Cole said. \\"She has done incredible work,\\" he said. \\"She's been bold enough _ yes she's been paid for her work _ but she's bold enough to get in and talk about it.\\" Public service announcements by Palin and another celebrity, Jenny McCarthy, are far more effective than those featuring non-celebrities, according to a survey of 1,000 teens commissioned in January by the foundation. A third of respondents said Palin's message made them consider the consequences of teen pregnancy, compared with 16 percent for non-celebrities. Among those surveyed, 57 percent said Palin got their attention and 41 percent called her message powerful, compared with no more than 28 percent and 11 percent, respectively, for non-celebrities. The Candie's Foundation is a division of the apparel brand Candie's. Cole said there were 1 million teen pregnancies a year when the foundation first started in 2001, compared with the current rate of 750,000 annually. Bloggers have criticized the organization for paying Palin more than seven times the 35,000 in grants it issued in 2009 to two organizations that tax documents called \\"public charities providing services to teenagers at risk.\\" Cole said there is no basis for that criticism. \\"That's not what we do for a living,\\" he said. \\"What we do for a living is create awareness.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"Bristol Palin, the eldest daughter of Sarah Palin, made a lot of money working to promote teen abstinence for The Candie's Foundation.

He has two older sisters, LaDonna, the eldest, and Lacey. Phillips grew up in Sasser and Leesburg, and attended Lee County High School. He graduated from Albany Technical College with a major in Industrial Systems Technology, but missed the graduation ceremony due to his obligations to American Idol. Context: Phillips auditioned in Savannah, Georgia. He sang \\"Superstition\\" by Stevie Wonder. The judges then asked him to perform a second song with his guitar, and he performed Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller.\\" He advanced to the Hollywood rounds, and later to the Las Vegas round. On February 23, 2012, Phillips was chosen as one of the Top 25 semi-finalists, and was then voted into the Top 13. His performance style on the show has been compared to Dave Matthews, and he covered one of his songs, \\"The Stone,\\" in the competition. When asked about Phillips' imitation of his style, Dave Matthews said: \\"More power to him, I don't mind,\\" and added \\"He should kick my ass, [then] maybe I can retire and he can take over my band.\\" Mentor Stevie Nicks said Phillips would have been good enough to join Fleetwood Mac back in 1975, after his performance of Jonny Lang's Still Rainin, which he received a standing ovation from the judges. After the Top 13 performance night, Phillips was taken to a doctor for possible kidney stones. He had eight procedures while he was on Idol, and considered quitting the show due to the pain. For his Top 3 performance, Phillips sang Bob Seger's \\"We've Got Tonight.\\" For Top 4, he did a cover of Damien Rice's Volcano - which has been heralded as one of the best American Idol performances of all time. As the sole contestant who was never in jeopardy of elimination in any week of the competition, Phillips became the winner on the finale against Jessica Sanchez after a record-breaking 132 million votes were cast. His coronation song, \\"Home,\\" was released after his performance, and had the biggest digital sales week for any Idol winner's coronation song. ^Note 1 Due to the judges using their one save on Jessica Sanchez, the Top 7 remained intact for another week. Question: Why was he taken to a doctor?. Whats the answer?","output":"Phillip Phillips was taken to a doctor during his time on American Idol due to concerns about possible kidney stones. He experienced significant pain and underwent eight medical procedures while he was on the show. The severity of his condition even led him to consider quitting the competition at one point. However, Phillips persevered and went on to win the season, never facing elimination during the course of the show. His health issues were a major concern during his journey on American Idol, but he managed to continue performing and eventually triumphed in the competition."},{"instruction":"Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Choices: --negative. --positive.

Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions. - Historicity is the historical actuality of persons and events, meaning the quality of being part of history as opposed to being a historical myth, legend, or fiction. Historicity focuses on the truth value of knowledge claims about the past (denoting historical actuality, authenticity, and factuality). The historicity of a claim about the past is its factual status. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - In Abrahamic religions, the Messiah or Messias is a saviour or liberator of a group of people, more specifically, the Jewish people. - At the start of his reign, Japan was already one of the great powersthe ninth-largest economy in the world, the third-largest naval power, and one of the four permanent members of the council of the League of Nations. He was the head of state under the Constitution of the Empire of Japan during Japan's imperial expansion, militarization, and involvement in World War II. After the Japan's defeat of the war, he was not prosecuted for war crimes as many other leading government figures were, and his degree of involvement in wartime decisions remains controversial among historians. During the post-war period, he became the symbol of the new state under the post-war constitution and Japan's recovery, and by the end of his reign, Japan had emerged as the world's second largest economy. - Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\"; , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has ensured his status as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history. - A parable is a succinct, didactic story, in prose or verse, which illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles. It differs from a fable in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters. A parable is a type of analogy. - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions. - Nazareth (\\"Narat\\" \\"Narath\\" \\"an-Nira\\") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \\"the Arab capital of Israel\\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. \\"Upper Nazareth\\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974. - The Christian Church is a term generally used to refer to the whole group of people belonging to the Christian religious tradition throughout history. In this understanding, the \\"Christian Church\\" does not refer to a particular Christian denomination but to the body of all believers. Some Christians believe that the term \\"Christian Church\\" or \\"Church\\" applies only to a specific historic Christian institution (e.g., the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy). The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed are unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity. - A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books. - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah. This title derives from the Hebrew word ' , meaning \\"My Master\\" (irregular plural ' ), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word \\"master\\" \\"\\" literally means \\"great one\\". - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived. - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion. - The historicity of Jesus concerns whether Jesus of Nazareth , born c 7 -- 2 BC , existed as a historical figure , whether the episodes portrayed in the gospels can be confirmed as historical events as opposed to myth , legend , or fiction , and the weighing of the evidence relating to his life . One of the chief problems confronting scholars interested in the historicity of Jesus , like that of the historicity of King Arthur , is that there are no contemporary records of his life or existence . Like many genuinely historical figures of antiquity , all records of his historicity come from one or more generations after his death , the earliest source being that found in the Epistles of Paul dated to AD 59 , who discusses his crucifixion . Other sources such as that of Josephus or Tacitus date even later . Historians interested in the historicity of Jesus are confronted by discussing the nature of these historic records and the intention and points of view of their authors . Although there is \`\` near universal consensus '' among scholars that Jesus existed historically , biblical scholars differ about the beliefs and teachings of Jesus as well as the accuracy of the details of his life that have been described in the gospels . While scholars have sometimes criticized Jesus scholarship for religious bias and lack of methodological soundness , with very few exceptions , such critics do support the historicity of Jesus , and reject the theory that Jesus never existed , known as the Christ myth theory . Certain scholars , particularly in Europe , have recently made the case that while there are a number of plausible \`\` Jesi '' that could have existed , there can be no certainty as to which Jesus was the historical Jesus , and that there should also be more scholarly research and debate on this topic . The historicity of Jesus is distinct from the related study of the historical Jesus , which refers to scholarly reconstructions of the life of Jesus , based primarily on critical analysis of the gospel texts .... - History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. - Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (\\"Aléxandros ho Mégas\\" ), was a king (\\"basileus\\") of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.

A question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera, lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer.

They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community.

The mastermind, a Chechen terrorist named Abu Shabal (Jason Cottle), escapes to a training camp in Indonesia. Elsewhere in Costa Rica, two CIA operatives, Walter Ross (Nestor Serrano) and Lisa Morales (Roselyn SÃ¡nchez) meet to consolidate intelligence about their target, a drug smuggler named Mikhail \\"Christo\\" Troykovich. Christo's men kill Ross and capture Morales, who is imprisoned in a jungle compound and tortured. At Coronado, the members of Bandito Platoon, SEAL Team Seven are at home. Lieutenant Rorke (Rorke Denver) confides to Chief Dave that his wife is pregnant and has the entire team spend time together with their families until their next deployment. A squad from the platoon consisting of Rorke, Dave, Wiemy, Mikey, Ray, Sonny, and Ajay, is then deployed to Costa Rica to exfiltrate Morales. The seven Navy SEALs insert into the jungle via HALO and hold position outside the compound all night. At dawn, they approach the compound, hear Morales being tortured, and decide to enter the compound early.

After completing his gymnastics routine on the balance beam, the man dismounts in an impressive display of agility and finesse. However, instead of stopping there, he proceeds to add another layer of complexity to his performance. With adrenaline surging through his veins and the momentum from his dismount carrying him forward, he launches himself into another set of exercises.

As the surprised spectators watch, the man transitions seamlessly from one maneuver to another, blending the movements together into a mesmerizing dance-like performance. His focus is unwavering, and his determination is evident in every aspect of the routine. The balance beam now seems like only a small part of this elaborate show, as the gymnast appears to have effortlessly moved from the beam to open floor. The somersaults are executed with precision and deliberate intent, the gymnast's body seemingly defying gravity as he demonstrates a variety of front and back flips. Loose hair and clothing ripple around him with each rotation, drawing further attention to the force of his movements and the sheer power behind them.

Answer choices: - aerobic capacity - good olfaction - a cuticle - warm-blooded - graptolites - an organism's body - permineralization - stamina Answer:","output":"One attribute of most reptiles is their good olfaction. Reptiles are a class of cold-blooded animals, including turtles, lizards, snakes, and crocodiles, and they show a wide range of ecological and physiological adaptations to their environments. Among these adaptations, the development of a good sense of smell, or olfaction, has proven to be significant in their survivability and success as a group. Olfaction is the sense that allows animals to detect volatile chemicals in their environment. In reptiles, this sense of smell plays a crucial role in various aspects of their lives, such as foraging for food, avoiding predators, locating mates, and navigating within their habitats. The olfactory system in reptiles typically consists of two main components: the main olfactory system (MOS) and the vomeronasal system (VNS), sometimes called the Jacobson's organ. The MOS deals with the detection of general odorants in the environment. In reptiles, the main olfactory system is located in the nasal cavity and consists of a specialized sensory epithelium that contains olfactory receptor neurons. These neurons can recognize and bind to specific odor molecules, sending signals to the brain to interpret and process the information. The VNS, on the other hand, is specialized for the detection of pheromones, chemical signals produced by other individuals of the same species and serve as a means of communication. The vomeronasal system is situated in a separate part of the nasal cavity and also contains its own sensory epithelium. While not all reptiles possess a vomeronasal system, it is well-developed in those that use chemical cues as a primary communication mechanism, such as snakes and some lizards. To sum up, one attribute of most reptiles is their good olfaction, which plays a crucial role in their survival by assisting them in locating food, identifying potential mating partners, recognizing threats, and navigating their environments. The sophisticated olfactory systems found in these animals, including both the main olfactory system and the vomeronasal system (in some species), are highly specialized and adapted for efficient detection and processing of relevant chemical cues."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: The Virgin Spring tells the story, set in the late medieval Sweden, of a prosperous Christian whose daughter, Karin (Birgitta Pettersson), is appointed to take candles to the church.

Farmer Fleming saved the boy from what could have been a slow and terrifying death. The next day, a fancy carriage pulled up to the Scotsman' s surroundings. An elegantly dressed nobleman stepped out and introduced himself as the father of the boy Farmer Fleming had saved. \\"I want to repay you,\\" said the nobleman. \\"You saved my son' s life.\\" \\"No, I can' t accept payment for what I did,\\" the Scottish farmer replied, waving off the offer.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside.

It is clear from this statement that there is a sense of growing concern and dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs in the field being referred to, most likely in the context of political, social, or economic topics within the European Union. The lack of progress and vague promises mentioned are not providing adequate reassurance or tangible results that the situation will improve or that meaningful policy changes are taking place. It can be inferred that the matter discussed could involve negotiations between various member states, politicians, and EU bodies struggling to find common ground or agree on new treaties and reforms. The reform treaty mentioned suggests that the issue may be related to how the European Union operates, organizes itself, or even sets its political agendas. One possibility is that this statement is addressing the ongoing debates surrounding EU political integration. Many European countries and their citizens have voiced their concerns both in favor and against this process. Those who support deeper political integration often argue that it would promote stronger unity, cooperation, and shared sovereignty among the member states, ultimately leading to greater political and economic stability. On the other hand, opponents to further integration argue that it could lead to a loss of national sovereignty and autonomy for EU countries. They may worry about the power being increasingly centralized in Brussels, which could potentially limit each country's decision-making and control over their own laws and policies. It is this complex and divisive subject that may be referred to in the statement. Moreover, this reluctance to advance EU reforms could also be attributed to the turbulent political climate in various member states in recent years. Shifts in political positions and voter sentiment reflect a diverse spectrum of opinions on the direction of the EU. As a result, reaching a consensus on essential political reforms and integrating such policies into a reform treaty is undoubtedly challenging. In conclusion, the statement highlights the lack of progress, policies, and clarity spanning across the European Union's political spectrum. As the integration and reform debates continue, it remains crucial for policymakers to engage with diverse opinions and concerns to ensure a balanced approach is taken, paving a way for meaningful and enduring improvements for the entire region."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization.

Here are the options listed in a step-by-step approach: 1. Prevent it from becoming worse: The first priority is to avoid aggravating the injury further. This may involve immobilizing the affected area, stopping any activity that may be exacerbating the problem, and taking the necessary precautions to prevent further damage. 2. Control and prevent bleeding: If the injury is accompanied by bleeding, it's essential to stop the bleeding by applying direct pressure with a clean cloth or bandage. You may also need to elevate the injured area to reduce blood flow. Proper bleeding control can prevent blood loss and reduce the risk of infection. 3. Prevent infection: Keeping the wound clean is crucial to avoid infection. Clean the affected area gently with mild soap and water, and cover it with a sterile dressing or bandage, changing it regularly to keep the wound clean and dry. If you notice signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, pus, or increased pain, consult your healthcare provider. 4. Reduce pain: After an injury, it's natural to experience pain. To manage pain, you can use over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen, or apply cold packs or warm compresses to the injured area. Remember to follow the medication's directions and avoid using it for prolonged periods without consulting your doctor. 5. Prevent death: Although it is an extreme outcome, preventing death should be the primary goal in severe and life-threatening injuries. In these cases, call emergency services immediately and follow their instructions. Prompt medical attention can be essential in saving a life. In summary, after sustaining an injury, it's crucial to prevent it from becoming worse, control and prevent bleeding, prevent infection, manage pain, and in severe cases, take immediate action to prevent death. These steps will not only ensure that the injury heals properly but also minimize the potential long-term effects."},{"instruction":"Because I locked my keys in my locker at the gym last night and had to have my lock cut off because I knew how bad it would look for me to pick it .

This implies that the product might not be user-friendly or function as it should. 3. Another person's experience: \\"My partner couldn't believe it wouldn't work and, thinking I might be too easily put off, tried it too, using as many alternative artful variations in technique as he could think of. It didn't work for him either.\\" – The reviewer mentions that their partner tried to use the product as well but faced similar issues.

Options: - defecating - pooping - reduced - becoming full - gaining weight The answer is \\"becoming full\\" because","output":"after eating, the stomach begins to fill with food, which stimulates stretch receptors in the stomach walls. These receptors send signals to the brain that the stomach is full and that the sensation of satiety has been reached. As a result, one's appetite is reduced, and they feel satisfied and full. This is a natural process that occurs immediately after eating to prevent overconsumption of food and to maintain a healthy balance of nutrition. The other options presented might happen to various degrees as a consequence of eating, but they are not immediate responses. Defecating, pooping, and gaining weight occur over a longer period as the body processes the consumed food and extracts nutrients. Reduced may not be relevant here as it does not convey a clear meaning regarding the process of eating. Therefore, \\"becoming full\\" is the most accurate answer because it describes the immediate effect of eating on the body, which is to feel satisfied and full."},{"instruction":"What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"the presence of which of these is required for the formation of cavernous chambers?\\"","output":"The presence of soluble rocks, specifically limestone, is required for the formation of cavernous chambers."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article.

But he became self conscious about his weight. So he decided to buy a bike instead. After a month, he lost a good amount of weight. And he was glad he spent so much time riding his bike. Choose your answer: based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Fred felt the bike would help him lose weight better than car pooling with others.\\"? Select from: [I] Yes. [II] It's impossible to say. [III] No. I think the answer is","output":"[I] Yes. The narrative presented here provides sufficient evidence to support the assertion that \\"Fred felt the bike would help him lose weight better than car pooling with others.\\" We can deduce this through several key points. Initially, Fred is described as planning to buy a car - a means of transportation that requires minimal physical activity. However, after becoming self-conscious about his weight, Fred decided to buy a bike instead. This implies that Fred connected biking with weight loss, and he felt it would be a more effective alternative than driving to school. Biking is, generally speaking, a form of exercise that can lead to weight loss. It requires physical activity and, thus, the burning of calories, which is unlike driving. If Fred had intended to car pool, he would not have had the opportunity to engage in this level of physical activity. His decision to choose a bike over a car indicates that he believed the physical activity derived from biking would be more beneficial to his weight loss goals than would be sitting in a car. Furthermore, after a month of riding his bike, Fred did indeed lose a \\"good amount of weight\\" and was pleased with his decision. This outcome reaffirms to us that Fred's weight loss was directly linked to his choice of biking over driving or car pooling. His weight loss and satisfaction underscore the effectiveness of biking as a weight loss measure, in Fred's view. However, it's crucial to remember that this conclusion is based on the information provided. If further data were introduced suggesting that Fred also made significant changes to his diet or added additional physical activity, the conclusion might be different. As it stands with only the presented facts, we can reasonably infer that Fred felt biking was a better option for weight-loss than car pooling."},{"instruction":"Context: Because of a boom in the mining sector, Mongolia had high growth rates in 2007 and 2008 (9.9% and 8.9%, respectively).

Apsara Dance, famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance. Q: The Khmer Empire was influenced by what?","output":"The Khmer Empire was significantly influenced by Indian culture, religion, politics, and art. This pervasive Indian influence can be traced back to the early relations and interactions between the Southeast Asian kingdoms and Indian traders, scholars, and religious figures. A few aspects of Indian influence on the Khmer Empire include: 1. Religion: Indian religions, primarily Hinduism and Buddhism, had a profound impact on the Khmer Empire. The dominant religion in the empire shifted over time, but Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism were widely practiced and revered, and later Theravada Buddhism gained ground as well. The devaraja cult, which involved the worship of a god-king, was prevalent during the height of the Khmer Empire, and it derived its foundations from Indian religious beliefs. 2. Language and Literature: Sanskrit, an ancient language of India, was a significant element of Khmer education, literature, and administration. Royal inscriptions, poems, and other works were often composed in both Sanskrit and Khmer languages. The Khmer Empire also adapted the ancient Indian script, Pallava, to create the Khmer script in which they wrote their literature, including religious texts, law books, and inscriptions. 3. Art and Architecture: Indian-influenced art and architectural styles are prominent in the Khmer Empire. The iconic temple complexes at Angkor, including the world-renowned Angkor Wat, were built in styles that showcase Indian architectural elements, such as the temple-mountain concept and intricate carvings of Hindu deities. The Khmer artistic tradition also integrated features from Indian dance, sculpture, and painting. 4. Politics and Administration: The political organization of the Khmer Empire was structured around the principles of Indian-origin political theory, especially the concept of centralized monarchy. Ideas from Indian treatises on politics, such as the Arthashastra, influenced the Khmer system of governance, administration, and law. 5. Trade and Commerce: The Khmer Empire was a part of the vast Indian Ocean trade network, which connected the commerce between the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and China. Indian traders, merchants, and settlers played an influential role in shaping the economic landscape and exchange patterns of the Khmer Empire. In conclusion, the Khmer Empire was deeply influenced by Indian cultural, religious, linguistic, political, artistic, and economic elements. These influences played a crucial role in shaping the development and character of the Khmer Empire throughout its history."},{"instruction":"Write the last sentence in this story.

Muscles: The specific muscle groups involved in climbing include the forearm and finger muscles for grip strength, biceps and triceps for arm strength, core muscles for overall stability and balance, and leg muscles, especially the quadriceps and calf muscles for supporting body weight and pushing upwards. In conclusion, climbing is a multifaceted activity demanding a combination of strength, skill, experience, dexterity, and proper use of specific muscles. To improve in climbing, one needs to focus on developing each of these aspects through regular practice, training, and education."},{"instruction":"Context: Sohn first competed in the 1,500 and 5,000 m, but turned to longer distances after winning an eight-mile race in October 1933.

Passage:At the 1989 election, Buchanan successfully transferred to the newly recreated seat of Ashburton, with her replacement in Pilbara, Larry Graham, retaining that seat for Labor. The re-elected Dowding government persisted only until February 1990, when it was replaced by the Lawrence government following Dowding's forced resignation. New premier Carmen Lawrence elevated Buchanan to the ministry as Minister for Works and Services and Minister for Regional Development. She was also made assistant minister to Lawrence in her capacity as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. However, the regional development portfolio was abolished in December 1990, and Buchanan lost her remaining portfolios in February 1991, as part of a ministerial reshuffle prompted by an internal spill motion. Jeff Carr and Gavan Troy were also removed as ministers, with Carr consequently resigning from parliament. Buchanan herself resigned to sit as an independent on 1 February 1991, before the new ministry was sworn in four days later. She consequently became the first woman in the Parliament of Western Australia to sit as an independent. Buchanan resigned due to ill health just over a year later, in March 1992, and died at the end of that month, aged 55. She had married George Maitland Buchanan in April 1957, with whom she had two daughters. Her resignation prompted a by-election in Ashburton, which was won by the Labor candidate Fred Riebeling.

Review: From the moment I entered Bella Italiano, I knew I was in for an unforgettable dining experience. The warm, inviting atmosphere and the aroma of authentic Italian cuisine set the stage for an incredible meal. What truly sets Bella Italiano apart is its exquisite menu. For starters, their Bruschetta is a must-try, with perfectly toasted bread and a fresh, flavorful tomato topping. The main courses, however, are where Bella Italiano really shines. The Frutti di Mare linguine was packed with generous portions of seafood, perfectly cooked pasta, and a savory, garlicky sauce that left me craving more. The dessert menu is no less impressive, with a divine Tiramisu that managed to achieve the perfect balance of coffee and mascarpone flavors. Any visit to Bella Italiano should absolutely include this sweet finale. Although the restaurant was bustling and the wait time for our dishes was slightly longer than expected, the attentive service ensured that our entire experience remained enjoyable. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and happy to offer recommendations. In summary, Bella Italiano offers delectable Italian cuisine with a cozy ambiance and great service.

The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is I am facing a new situation today: Bill is working in a sound studio recording sound effects for a short film that he is working on.

Lewis School of Business. To fully respond to your question, we should first provide a brief background on Virginia State University and then on the Reginald F. Lewis School of Business specifically. Virginia State University was founded on March 6, 1882, when the legislature passed a bill to charter the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute. The bill was sponsored by Delegate Alfred W. Harris, a black attorney whose offices were in Petersburg, but who lived in and represented Dinwiddie County in the General Assembly. A hostile lawsuit delayed opening day for nineteen months until October 1, 1883. In 1902, the legislature revised the school's charter and renamed it the Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute. In 1920, the land-grant portion of the College was renamed the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute. The entire institution became Virginia State College in 1946. Then, in 1979, the name was changed again to Virginia State University as we know it today. The Reginald F. Lewis School of Business, where Mirta Martin served as the Dean, however, was established much later. The university initiated a set of major expansions in the late 20th and early 21st century and the business school was a part of these growth initiatives. The Reginald F. Lewis College of Business was purposefully named to honor the legacy of the famous businessman and philanthropist, Reginald F. Lewis. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the exact founding year of the business school, and I would recommend directly contacting Virginia State University for the most accurate information. Mirta Maria Martin indeed played a significant role in the development of the school during her time as the Dean. Prior to her tenure at Virginia State University, Martin had achieved an impressive career in academic leadership roles, including her position as president of Kansas State University. She brought with her a wealth of experience and strategic vision that was instrumental in driving the growth and evolution of the Reginald F. Lewis School of Business. In conclusion, while the exact founding year of the Reginald F. Lewis School of Business is not available, it is a critical part of Virginia State University, a historic institution that was originally founded on March 6, 1882."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Hindi language and a corresponding English translation of the Hindi sentence.

British scientists said last Wednesday humans may have underestimated the woolly creature. They could be much smarter than we think. Researchers at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, southern England, have shown that the animals have a good memory system and are extremely good at recognizing faces--which they think is a sure sign of intelligence. Behavioral scientist Keith Kendrick and his friends trained 20 sheep to recognize and distinguish 25 pairs of sheep faces and used electrodes to measure their brain activity , which showed they could remember 50 faces for up to two years . \\"If they can do that with faces, they have to have reasonable intelligence; otherwise, what is the point of having a system for remembering faces and not remembering anything else?\\" Kendrick said in an interview. So hours of seemingly mindless eating grass may not be so mindless after all. Kendrick believes sheep got their reputation as dumb (unable to speak, unintelligent) animals because they live in large groups and do not appear to have much individuality and are frightened of just about everything. \\"All animals, including humans, once they are frightened, don't tend to show signs of intelligent action,\\" he explained. In research reported in the science journal Nature, Kendrick and his team showed that sheep, like humans, have a specialized system in the brain which allows them to distinguish between many different faces which look extremely similar. \\"The most important finding (of the study) is that they are able , both from a behavioral point of view and from looking at the way the brain is organized , to remember a large number of individuals for a very long time,\\" said Kendrick. \\"It is a very strange system.

Here are possible answers to this question: - sewer - bathroom - glass - drain - behind the curtain I believe the correct choice is \\"sewer\\", here's why: A:","output":"Water runoff overflow typically ends up in a \\"sewer\\", and here's why: When water is unable to absorb into the ground (for example during heavy rainfall or snowmelt), it becomes surface runoff. This runoff is directed away from property to prevent flooding and water damage. The infrastructure in place to manage this water usually involves a system of gutters, downspouts, graded landscapes, and drainage ditches that direct the water to local sewers. The sewers, also known as storm drains or storm sewers, are designed with this purpose in mind. They work by collecting and carrying away this excess water, mitigating the risk of localized flooding. While some runoff temporarily resides in drains or gutters, it eventually travels to the sewer system. The other options like the bathroom, glass, or behind the curtain, don't make much sense in this context as they are not typically directly involved in the path of water runoff overflow. It's important to note that in some regions, stormwater runoff will merge with other sewage before being treated at a wastewater treatment plant. But in other areas, the stormwater runoff is discharged into local bodies of water without any treatment, which is why it's essential to reduce pollutants in our runoff."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Current holder Cristiano Ronaldo and four-time winner Lionel Messi are the favourites to win 2014 Ballon d'Or. However Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes a German 'deserves' to win award. Germans Mario Gotze, Toni Kroos, Philipp Lahm, Thomas Muller, Manuel Neuer and Bastian Schweinsteiger have been included on shortlist. Van Gaal nominated for Coach of the Year but jokes: 'When you see Manchester United's results it's unbelievable I'm on shortlist'","output":"Title: Van Gaal Backs German Stars for 2014 Ballon d'Or as Ronaldo and Messi Lead the Race The race for the 2014 Ballon d'Or is in full swing, with current holder Cristiano Ronaldo and four-time winner Lionel Messi being the frontrunners to take home the prestigious award. Yet, Manchester United's manager, Louis van Gaal, believes that it is a German player who truly \\"deserves\\" to win the honor this year. The Dutch manager's comment comes in the wake of the shortlisting of six German footballers, including Mario Gotze, Toni Kroos, Philipp Lahm, Thomas Muller, Manuel Neuer, and Bastian Schweinsteiger, for the award. The Ballon d'Or, a prestigious individual award for footballers, has historically been dominated by Ronaldo and Messi, who have been trading the trophy between themselves for the past six years. However, the 2014 World Cup saw Germany emerge victorious, staking their claim to the award - through their stunning group-stage performances and their demolition of Brazil in the semi-finals. Van Gaal's comment clearly indicates his belief that a German player should win the award due to their national team's stellar performance in the tournament. Throughout the 2014 World Cup, these German footballers showcased their incredible skill, determination, and teamwork. Players like Kroos, Muller, and Neuer played pivotal roles in ensuring Germany's victory. Mario Gotze, the 22-year-old midfielder, was the one who scored the match-winning goal in the World Cup final against Argentina, effectively sealing the championship for the German national team. Toni Kroos was named as the tournament's best player, with his creativity and accurate passes linking the team's play. Philipp Lahm, the captain, steered the German ship through challenging games with his strong defensive contributions, while Thomas Muller scored crucial goals throughout the tournament. The goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer, displayed exceptional skills between the posts and played a significant role in Germany's success. Bastian Schweinsteiger, often seen as the heart of the team, was highly instrumental in maintaining the German midfield's balance. Interestingly, Van Gaal himself has been nominated for the Coach of the Year award following his successful stint as the Netherlands' national team manager. The Dutch coach guided the Oranje to a third-place finish in the 2014 World Cup, exceeding expectations. However, Van Gaal joked about his inclusion in the shortlist by remarking, \\"When you see Manchester United's results, it's unbelievable I'm on the shortlist.\\" His comment evidently addresses the struggles Manchester United faced in the 2014 season, with the team experiencing inconsistent performances since Van Gaal's arrival at Old Trafford. In conclusion, the 2014 Ballon d'Or has undoubtedly stirred up intense competition between seasoned winners Ronaldo and Messi and ambitious German footballers such as Gotze, Kroos, Lahm, Muller, Neuer, and Schweinsteiger. While it is uncertain who will emerge as the victor, the debate sparked by Van Gaal's comment serves as a testament to the strength and quality of the German players featured on the shortlist. As the world awaits the announcement of the Ballon d'Or winner, one cannot help but appreciate the incredible talent displayed by the nominees and the thrilling moments they provided fans throughout the year."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"A girl is playing the violin in the street while her band mate on the guitar is talking on her cellphone with a confused look.\\", can we conclude \\"People have musical instruments outdoors.\\"?

Sentence A: \\"My television is transparent.\\" In general, televisions have a solid and opaque appearance. Their screens are designed to display images and be easily visible to the viewer. A transparent television would make it difficult or nearly impossible to see the displayed images, as the background environment would show through. This notion is counterintuitive to the basic function of a television. Thus, this statement goes against common sense. Sentence B: \\"My television is broken.\\" Televisions, like any other electronic devices, can be prone to malfunction or damage. It is completely plausible for a television to experience issues, such as screen glitches, unresponsive buttons, or even complete failure. Therefore, this statement aligns with common sense. Based on the above analysis, Sentence A: \\"My television is transparent\\" goes against common sense, as televisions are generally not designed to be transparent."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a context, a sentence, and a character.

Trump, Coons said, had to decide whether he would continue to “[get] into Twitter fights or take unscheduled calls from foreign leaders in ways that break with decades of precedent”. The alternative, he said, was for the president-elect to rely “on the advice of career professionals and the state department and make moves in a calculated and thoughtful way”. Hours after Trump’s call became public knowledge on Friday, the Chinese government issued a complaint. “We have noticed relevant reports and lodged solemn representation with the relevant side in the United States,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement. “I must point out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory ... The ‘one China’ principle is the political foundation of China-US relations.” A spokesman for the Obama administration declined to comment on the complaint. Trump’s call with Tsai was the first publicly reported between a US president or president-elect and a leader of Taiwan since Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979. The US subsequently severed ties with the island, which is viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province. Trump sought to stem the backlash resulting from the call by noting on Twitter it was the Taiwanese president who had called him. But he was rebuked for the call by foreign policy experts, who raised concerns about his propensity to behave unpredictably. Christopher Hill, former assistant secretary of state for east Asia and Pacific affairs under George W Bush, said Trump had broken a 40-year tradition in one clear policy related to China. “Obviously, it was an example of what is all too often happening now with this incoming administration, this tendency to wing it,” Hill told CNN on Friday evening. He added his concern that Trump’s team would double down on the decision, as opposed to acknowledging the misstep. “That’s a huge mistake,” Hill said. “And this is not going to be the last of these kind of things. So, things need to get … cleaned up in a hurry in Washington.” The Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, another Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, criticized Trump in a series of tweets late on Friday. “Foreign policy consistency is a means, not an end. It’s not sacred. Thus, it’s Trump’s right to shift policy, alliances, strategy,” Murphy wrote. America’s allies, Murphy said, would “have no clue” what the country stood for if the conversation did not represent a genuine change in foreign policy but simply a temporary deviation at Trump’s behest. The senator further underscored the need for Trump to nominate a secretary of state, “preferably [with] experience”. In his defense, Trump tweeted: “Interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.” His transition team described the conversation in a statement as a discussion “of the close economic, political and security ties that exist between Taiwan and the United States”, in which the president-elect also congratulated Tsai on her election earlier this year. The Taiwanese president characterized the phone call as an “intimate and relaxed conversation” that lasted 10 minutes. A translation of a statement posted on an official Taiwanese government website said Trump and Tsai broached topics including the domestic economy and national defense, and “allowing the people better lives and a guarantee of security”. “The two briefly exchanged opinions on the situation in the Asia region,” the statement read. Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump aide, pushed back on the notion that Trump did not grasp the implications of taking the phone call. “He either will disclose or not disclose the full contents of that conversation but he’s well aware of what US policy has been,” she told CNN. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Donald Trump's recent phone call with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has caused people to worry that Trump might change the way the United States has been dealing with other countries for a very long time. China, a big and powerful country, was not happy about this phone call because they think Taiwan is a part of China, and the United States has agreed with them since 1979. Critics say that Trump needs to be more careful with how he talks to leaders of other countries and listen to advice from people who know about these things. Trump said that Taiwan's president called him to say congratulations and he just wanted to be friendly by taking the call."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"Le soleil brille et les oiseaux chantent, donnant un sentiment de sérénité et de joie à cette belle journée printanière.\\" This French sentence translates to: \\"The sun is shining and the birds are singing, giving a sense of serenity and joy to this beautiful spring day.\\""},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Consumers still would have to get a descrambling security card from their cable operator to plug into the set.

Duplets are simply two sounds thrown quickly together (\\"da-DA!\\"), and triplets are three sounds (\\"BEEP-da-BOP\\"). Instead of using straight quarter notes, where you have one sound per beat (1, 2, 3, 4), start stringing together these other phrases, leaving spaces in between them for a bouncy, swinging feel. Hold some notes for three beats, cram 10 notes into two beats, and then leave some silence before launching back in. Rhythmic variety is about playing with the beat to create tension and surprise. Alternating different types of rhythms is a great way to craft a complex, enjoyable scat solo without crazy notes or vocal range. Check out both Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, for example, on \\"Stomping at the Savoy\\" for a master class in rhythmic variation. An extension of rhythmic variation, this is when you transcend the \\"written\\" rhythm and get into the song with improvisational fervor. Most scatting is over a swing feel, where the 2nd and 4th beats are emphasized. Think of counting out your \\"1 and, 2 and, 3 and, 4 and\\" with a little extra emphasis on these two beats. If you're going to hit a high note, or pause and come back in, make it on the swinging beats. Great scat singers, like any great soloist or musician, are locked into the underlying chords and melody of the song they sing over. They know when chord changes are coming, and adjust their melody right in time with the rest of the band. Listen to the song several times until the chords' feel natural, and you know exactly what your band is doing behind you. If you're hoping to play professionally, there are a few progressions you should know: 12-Bar Blues-- the most common progression in Western Music. No matter what the key, the chords will always change in the same order, meaning you can quickly scat to any 12-bar blues once you know the form. I Got Rhythm -- known as the most covered chord progression in jazz, these changes are found in hundreds of songs, including popular music. Listen to versions from Duke Ellington to Django Reinhardt If you are classically trained, there is no reason to abandon your skills just to start scatting. Run through your exercises, scales, and warm-ups with improvised syllables and sounds, and start putting your vocal scales to music. As a warm up, read music but ignore the lyrics, trying to sound out just the notes of vocal, brass, and woodwind sheet music. Listen to Ella Fitzgerald closing out \\"Tenderly,\\" a dear, calm, and loving song, with a deep and almost monstrous scat sound. And yet, it fits, complementing her smooth tone with an unexpected burst of passion and power. Scatting isn't about sounding \\"human.\\" So, the further you can modulate and adjust your voice to sound more instrumental the better scat singer you'll become. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article focuses on the art of scat singing, a vocal improvisation technique in jazz music. The article highlights the importance of rhythmic variety and playing with different patterns, such as duplets and triplets, to create a bouncy and swinging feel. It also emphasizes the significance of understanding the underlying chords and melody of the song to scat effectively. Furthermore, the article encourages the utilization of existing vocal skills and exercises, while adapting to scatting. It mentions the importance of varying one's voice to sound more instrumental, citing examples from legendary scat singers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. Lastly, it provides some foundational progressions to learn, such as 12-Bar Blues and \\"I Got Rhythm\\", which are integral to mastering scat singing."},{"instruction":"bank of america ceo ken lewis has laid out his plans for raising new capital to meet government requirements .

Article:","output":"Title: President Obama Signs Groundbreaking Food Safety Bill, Revolutionizing the U.S. Food System Subtitle: The Food Safety Modernization Act Allows for Increased Governmental Regulation and Powers in the Interest of Public Health Introduction: The United States food system is about to change drastically. In a landmark moment, President Obama has signed the long-awaited food safety bill. This legislation, known as the Food Safety Modernization Act, marks the biggest overhaul of the country's food safety regulations since 1938, and promises sweeping changes that aim to protect the health and safety of American consumers. Greater Governmental Regulation of the U.S. Food System: The signing of the food safety bill will allow for much greater governmental regulation of the entire U.S. food system, from farm to table. This is a crucial step, given the dramatic increase in the complexity of food distribution networks and global supply chains in recent decades. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will now have enhanced powers to ensure that food producers adhere to the highest safety standards, significantly lowering the risk of foodborne illnesses and contamination incidents that have plagued the country in recent times. Direct Recalls of Foods by the FDA: One of the most important changes brought about by the new food safety bill is that it empowers the FDA to issue direct recalls of foods that are suspected to be contaminated or otherwise dangerous for consumption. Previously, the FDA had to rely on food producers to voluntarily recall affected items, a process that was often hindered by bureaucratic obstacles and delays. With the new legislation in place, American consumers can expect faster action and a more streamlined process for removing tainted food products from store shelves. The Biggest Overhaul Since 1938: It is vital to remember that this is not just another regulatory tweak - the Food Safety Modernization Act represents the most significant shift in the U.S. food safety system in over 80 years. The new law is a comprehensive attempt to modernize and streamline food safety protocols, as well as to enhance the powers of the FDA to protect public health. The bill acknowledges that the existing 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is no longer adequate to address the challenges of today’s complex food production landscape. Increased Collaboration and Proactivity: Another key aspect of the new food safety bill is that it encourages greater collaboration between different federal, state, and local agencies to detect and respond to food safety threats more effectively. The legislation mandates the creation of new communication channels and integrated IT systems that will allow for improved information sharing and faster coordinated response in the event of an outbreak or contamination incident. This increased proactivity will enable authorities to contain potential threats before they spiral out of control and put the wider public at risk. Conclusion: The Food Safety Modernization Act is a groundbreaking piece of legislation that signifies a major leap forward in the federal government's ability to protect the American public from foodborne illnesses and other food safety threats. By granting the FDA greater powers to regulate the food system and to issue direct recalls, the new law will vastly improve the speed and effectiveness with which dangerous food products are removed from store shelves. Furthermore, by fostering greater collaboration and proactivity among regulatory agencies, the U.S. can expect a stronger and more effective food safety system in both preventing and responding to foodborne dangers. With the biggest overhaul of food safety regulations since 1938 now signed into law, the future of America's food system looks a lot brighter and safer for all its citizens."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - A large amount of rain occurs - The water builds up behind the dam - The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full - The water flows into a river below the dam - The dam closes its gates - The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water - Eventually all of the floodwater will be slowly released into the river without causing any flood damage.

Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. -5*u - 21 + 46 can be simplified as -5*u + 25, since -21 and 46 are constants and can be added together. So, the equation becomes: -5*u + 25 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the term containing the variable (u) by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation. -5*u + 25 - 25 = 0 - 25 This simplifies to: -5*u = -25 Step 3: Solve for u by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of u, which is -5. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -5. (-5*u)/-5 = -25/-5 The left side simplifies to just u, and the right side simplifies to 5. u = 5 The solution for the equation -5*u - 21 + 46 = 0 is u = 5."},{"instruction":"In the 2011–12 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the stomata are not clogged with dust happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. If the stomata are not clogged with dust, they can function properly, allowing carbon dioxide to enter the plant's leaves more efficiently. This would mean that there is a higher availability of carbon dioxide for the photosynthesis process. With more carbon dioxide available and the other elements of the process - water, chlorophyll, and the sun's energy - remaining constant, photosynthesis can take place at a more optimal level. As a result, the plant can produce more glucose (sugar) and release more oxygen into the atmosphere. The perturbation hypothesis, which states that the stomata are not clogged with dust, leads to less sugar and oxygen being produced, but it is important to note that the effect is indirect."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

In the background, one can see the beautiful autumn foliage creating a warm, golden hue that blankets the area. The group of people, consisting of both young and old, work together diligently, bonding over the joy of shared labor and a common goal. Little children, wearing mittens and woolen caps, playfully jump into the enormous piles of leaves, eliciting laughter and smiles from others around them. The woman addressing the crowd, well-known in the neighborhood for her philanthropic endeavors and leadership qualities, passionately encourages everyone to not only keep their community clean, but also to appreciate the beauty of nature and its ephemeral character. Residents stop to listen, captivated by her words, and are visibly moved by her spirit and enthusiasm. The sense of unity and camaraderie among the diverse group of people is palpable, and it becomes clear that this is more than just a project to gather leaves – it is an opportunity for the community to come together and create lasting connections. As the hours pass, the sun begins to set, casting a warm glow on the scene. The mound of leaves in the large bin continues to grow, but so does the spirit of camaraderie among the participants. Neighbors who had been strangers just hours before are now conversing animatedly, making plans for future gatherings and community improvement initiatives. Eventually, the woman who had inspired the group steps forward with an idea – why not use these collected leaves as the centerpiece for a communal autumn festival? The idea is met with overwhelming enthusiasm, and people immediately start discussing arrangements, from decorations and activities to food and music. It is evident that this simple gathering of leaves has now evolved into a catalyst for a much larger celebration that will strengthen the bonds forged within the community on this special day. The day draws to a close, and as tired yet satisfied participants head to their homes, there's a collective sense of accomplishment. Not only have they managed to clean up their neighborhood, but they've also planted the seeds of friendship and togetherness, which will grow and flourish along with the changing seasons."},{"instruction":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Use sandpaper, steel wool, or anything else abrasive to clean away any grime or dirt from any areas of your pipes and fittings that need to be soldered. This will let your solder hold more tightly to the pipe and result in a more sturdy connection. You should only need to clean around 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of the piping to give you room to solder easily. If you're using a larger pipe fitting, you may need to clean more to ensure the point of overlap between the pipe and the fitting is prepared for soldering. Use 120-grit sandpaper or grade 1 steel wool for cleaning your pipe fittings. This should be enough to strip away dirt and grime without damaging the pipes themselves. If you plan on cutting and soldering a lot of pipes, you might benefit from a specialised pipe cleaner. This will let you more easily scrub away any impurities on the inside and outside of your pipes. Ask at your local hardware store or look online to find one that suits your needs. Use a small paintbrush to cover the ends of your pipes and the insides of your pipe fittings with a thin layer of flux. Look around the edges of the pipe for any large lumps of flux and brush them away. Any type of flux that you have will work when soldering pipes together. Acid flux will be more corrosive, but may damage pipes that are too fragile. Tinning flux will help hold your pipes together more strongly, but may be more difficult to find or more expensive. If you're unsure, ask at your local hardware store for advice on the best type of flux to use for the job you're working on. Hold the two sections you need to connect together in each hand, keeping them off of your work surface to prevent any flux from rubbing off. Push the two ends together securely until they are fully connected. Wipe away any flux that comes off with a clean paintbrush. You should connect a section of a few pipes together before you begin to solder them. Working one at a time may be very slow, and trying to deal with a long section all at once may be very difficult! Work with a few pieces at a time. Heat will make the metal expand, so you should always heat the larger sections of your pipes up before the smaller sections. Hold a soldering iron to the pipe, or use a blowtorch to heat the metal up until the soldering flux melts into the joint and begins to bubble slightly. When the flux is just starting to bubble and the pipe is hot, press the tip of the solder to the opposite side as you are holding the blowtorch. The solder should melt immediately and work into the joint to hold it together. Pull the torch away and quickly run the solder around the circumference of the joint to completely seal it. You should only need to use around 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) of the solder to completely seal the pipe. If the solder doesn't run into the joint and forms small beads that roll away from it instead, you might have burnt the flux or may not have cleaned the pipe properly. Wait until the pipes are cooled, disconnect them and start again. It's easier to reach around the back side of the pipe if you bend a small hook in the solder wire before you begin soldering. Grip the solder far enough away from the tip that you won't risk melted solder getting on your hands. For extra safety, wear fire-resistant gloves as you work. Once the pipes have cooled a little, look around the edges of the joints to make sure they are evenly coated with solder. If you notice any sections without solder, apply a small amount of flux on the area and let it melt with the residual heat of the pipes. Use the blowtorch to heat the pipe up again and apply a small amount of solder to the bare area. It may take a while to get a good feel for when pipes are completely soldered. As a general rule of thumb, as long as there is a thin, silvery trim around the edges of your fittings, the pipe should be fully soldered.

As you squeeze the brake, shift your body weight to the back of the bike or scooter. This helps your back wheel to slide on the ground. 5. Keep practicing! You might not skid the first time, but with more practice, you'll get better at it.

The 18-year-old American's brief but dramatic debut run in the French Open ended after he took a nasty tumble in the third set Friday against Lleyton Hewitt. Roddick tried to continue but played only four more points before retiring because of a strained left thigh. Hewitt led 6-7 (6), 6-4, 2-2, 40-15 when Roddick called it quits, tossing his racket aside in disappointment. \\"It took me awhile to regain my composure after the match,\\" Roddick said. \\"You don't want to go out like that. I wanted to make someone play well to beat me.\\" The young Floridian won the favor of French fans by overcoming cramps and hobbling past Michael Chang in a five-set thriller Wednesday. The third-round match against Hewitt was shaping up as another tense endurance test until Roddick fell chasing down a shot. Tests indicated the injury was just a strain. Roddick said he expects to be sidelined only a few days before beginning preparations for his debut later this month at Wimbledon, where his huge serve makes him a formidable threat. One American did advance in the top half of the men's draw: Detroit native Michael Russell, a 23-year-old qualifier ranked 122nd. Russell outlasted Xavier Malisse 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 and will next face Gustavo Kuerten, the top-seeded two-time champion. \\"Who's he? What's his name?\\" Russell joked, before admitting: \\"I'm going to be nervous.\\" Kuerten eliminated Karim Alami 6-3, 6-7 (3), 7-6 (5), 6-2. No. 4 Juan Carlos Ferrero and No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov also won, but No. 11 Tim Henman lost to Guillermo Canas. The biggest upset came on the women's side, where No. 15 Jelena Dokic lost 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 to Hungary's Petra Mandula, a qualifier ranked 131st. \\"I couldn't keep a rally going, which isn't like me,\\" Dokic said. \\"The way she plays, it usually suits me. She doesn't do very much. Everything she won was my mistakes.\\" Advancing were two Belgian teenagers, No. 12 Kim Clijsters and No. 14 Justine Henin, the only seeded players left in their half of the draw. Roddick's taxing win over Chang took a toll that likely contributed to his injury. He said his legs remained sore Friday, and his left hamstring began to tighten in the second set. After hitting a running forehand in the third set, Roddick came down awkwardly on his right ankle, stumbled and landed hard on his right hip. He rolled onto a tarpaulin near the backstop and remained curled on his side for almost a minute. Grimacing, he sat up before a trainer finally reached him. After receiving treatment for several minutes, Roddick slowly limped to his chair, covered with clay. He had his left thigh wrapped, then returned to the court and won the next point with a booming forehand. \\"I wanted to hit one more winner at Roland Garros,\\" he joked. But there would be no repeat of his gallant finish against Chang. With the injury hindering his serve and movement, Roddick double-faulted, hit two futile forehands and walked to the net to concede his first defeat on clay after 12 consecutive wins. The players shook hands and the sixth-seeded Hewitt raised his arms in triumph, drawing jeers from fans who apparently found his celebration excessive under the circumstances. The Australian said he didn't hear any boos. \\"Nobody likes to win like this,\\" he said. \\"We were having a great match.\\" Aside from the white caps both players wore backward, the pairing offered a contrast in style between youngsters touted as future Grand Slam champions: Roddick the big-swinging aggressor, Hewitt the fleet-footed retriever. Against Chang, Roddick slammed 37 aces, the most at Roland Garros in at least a decade. Against Hewitt he hit none, an astounding testament to the Aussie's quickness. \\"Returning is one of the better parts of my game,' said Hewitt, 20. \\"He serves big, but I felt I was in most of his service games.\\" But Roddick repeatedly summoned big serves when needed, overcoming seven set points in the opening set, six when serving. Hewitt was 0-for-10 on break points before finally converting one for a 3-2 lead in the second set. Roddick broke right back with a forehand winner to end a 22-shot exchange. \\"We were battling,\\" Roddick said. \\"It was good tennis. I wish we could have finished it.\\" Hewitt sensed a rivalry in the making. \\"We're going to have a lot of great matches, I'm sure,\\" Hewitt said. \\"He's got a great game. He's going to be good on every surface.\\" For now, Hewitt continues on clay. For Roddick, the grass of Wimbledon awaits.","output":"In this news article from June 2, 2001, 18-year-old American tennis player Andy Roddick's debut run in the French Open came to an end due to a strained left thigh.

And the answer is?","output":"The answer to the trivia question is Sigmund Freud. Swiss physician and psychologist Carl Gustav Jung was initially a disciple of Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Jung and Freud first met in 1907 and formed a close relationship based on their shared intellectual interests and desire to develop a new field of psychology. They became collaborators and friends, with Freud even viewing Jung as his protege and a potential successor to carry forward his work and ideas. However, their relationship started to deteriorate as fundamental disagreements emerged between them. One of the most significant points of disagreement was the nature and role of the libido. Freud believed that the libido was a purely sexual energy, driving human behavior and shaping psychological issues mainly through repression and sexual conflicts. He considered libido as the primary motivating force behind human behavior. Jung, on the other hand, disagreed with Freud's narrow view of the libido. He proposed a broader understanding of the concept that went beyond sexuality. Jung's theory of the libido centered on a more general notion of psychic energy, emphasizing that it encompasses other aspects of life, such as creativity, spirituality, and personal growth. He believed that the libido was the driving force not only for sexual desires but also for the development of the human psyche across different stages of life. The differences between Freud and Jung's theoretical perspectives culminated in the collapse of their partnership, with Jung ultimately breaking away from Freud's ideas and establishing his school of analytical psychology. He developed his concepts of the collective unconscious, archetypes, and individuation, which significantly contributed to the field of depth psychology and continue to influence modern psychological thought. In summary, Carl Jung was initially a disciple of Sigmund Freud, but their disagreements regarding the nature of the libido and other theoretical perspectives led to the end of their collaboration and friendship. Jung went on to develop his influential school of analytical psychology, which fundamentally differed from Freud's psychoanalysis."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Athens International Airport CITY_SERVED Athens; Athens International Airport LOCATION Spata; Athens International Airport RUNWAY_LENGTH 3800.0","output":"Athens International Airport, serving the city of Athens, is strategically located in Spata and boasts a runway length of 3800.0 meters.

Plan a future event: Quinn's actions might inspire others to plan and host their events, or even collaborate with Quinn to co-host a special event. In conclusion, \\"thank Quinn\\" is indeed a valid answer to the question of what others may want to do next after the surprise party featuring a clown entertainer. It acknowledges the contributions made by Quinn in organizing the event and is a natural way for people to express their appreciation. While it is just one example of how others might react, it is vital to recognize that individual responses may vary depending on the person and situation."},{"instruction":"Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages. Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use \\"Celtic\\" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \\"Celtic art\\" only from the La Tene period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards. Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD. From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the Picts is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts. The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including Iona, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south. After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced Pictish art, with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones. Pictish stones are assigned by scholars to 3 classes. Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the Pictish Beast, and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror). The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others. This is often taken to symbolise a woman. Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east Scotland from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. Good examples include the Dunnichen and Aberlemno stones (Angus), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones (Aberdeenshire). Class II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces. The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key-pattern or scrollwork, in the Insular style. On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes. Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so. The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures. Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology. Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle (Perthshire), Aberlemno (Angus), Nigg, Shandwick and Hilton of Cadboll (Easter Ross). Class III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols. Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, Perthshire). These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century. Examples include the sarcophagus and the large collection of cross-slabs at St Andrews (Fife). The following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle (Perthshire), St Vigeans (Angus) and St Andrew's Cathedral (Fife) (all Historic Scotland), the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, Forfar (Angus), Inverness Museum, Groam House Museum, Rosemarkie and Tarbat Discovery Centre, Portmahomack (both Easter Ross) and Tankerness House Museum, Kirkwall, Orkney. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What are the Picts?","output":"The Picts are people who were known for their art from the 5th to the mid-9th centuries.

The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933.

This can be accomplished in many different ways leading to a plethora of antenna designs. The vast majority of designs are fed with a balanced line (unlike a monopole antenna) and are based on the dipole antenna with additional components (or elements) which increase its directionality. Antenna \\"gain\\" in this instance describes the concentration of radiated power into a particular solid angle of space, as opposed to the spherically uniform radiation of the ideal radiator. The increased power in the desired direction is at the expense of that in the undesired directions. Power is conserved, and there is no net power increase over that delivered from the power source (the transmitter.) What is different from a monopole antenna with most other antenna types?","output":"A monopole antenna is different from most other antenna types in several ways. Here is a detailed comparison and discussion of the major differences: 1. Structure and Design: A monopole antenna consists of a single, straight conductive element that is typically mounted vertically above a ground plane, which can be a conductive surface or a set of radials positioned symmetrically around the base of the antenna. On the other hand, many other antenna types, like dipoles, Yagi-Uda antennas, and log-periodic antennas, have more complex structures, with multiple conductive elements positioned in various configurations. 2. Balanced vs. Unbalanced Feed: Monopole antennas are fed with an unbalanced feedline, such as a coaxial cable, which connects the transmitter or receiver to the antenna. The ground plane or radial system serves as the return path for the current. In contrast, many other antenna types utilize balanced feedlines, like twin-lead or ladder line, which means that both conductors carry equal and opposite currents, effectively canceling out their electromagnetic fields. 3. Polarization: Monopole antennas are predominantly vertically polarized, meaning that the electric field component of the radiated wave oscillates in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's surface. Most other antenna types can be designed for either vertical or horizontal polarization, which refers to the orientation of the electric field component of the radiated wave being parallel to the Earth's surface. 4. Radiation Pattern: A monopole antenna has an omnidirectional radiation pattern in the horizontal plane, radiating equal amounts of power in all azimuthal directions. Many other antenna types, such as Yagi-Uda antennas and parabolic reflector antennas, have directional radiation patterns, focusing the radiated power into a narrow beam to achieve higher gain and directivity. 5. Gain: Monopole antennas generally have lower gain compared to many other antenna types. Their simple design, omnidirectional radiation pattern, and reliance on a ground plane result in a less focused transmission or reception of radio waves. In contrast, more complex antenna designs, like Yagi-Uda antennas, phased arrays, and parabolic reflectors, achieve higher gain by concentrating the radiated power in a specific direction at the expense of other directions. 6. Efficiency: Monopole antennas can be less efficient than other antenna types if the ground plane or radial system is not adequately designed. The presence of a ground plane, particularly if it is small or poorly constructed, can lead to losses in the form of ground currents that result in reduced radiation efficiency. Most other antenna types, such as dipoles and loop antennas, do not rely on a ground plane and may offer more consistent performance. In summary, monopole antennas differ from most other antenna types primarily in their design, feed method, polarization, radiation pattern, gain, and efficiency. While their simplicity makes them ideal for certain applications, more complex antenna designs are often necessary to achieve higher directivity, gain, and efficiency."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Diplomatic protection.\\" to French?","output":"\\"Diplomatic protection\\" is a crucial concept in international law where a state protects the rights of its citizens abroad by exercising its diplomatic and consular functions. The primary purpose of diplomatic protection is to ensure that foreign governments respect the rights of other states' nationals while they are abroad. In French, \\"Diplomatic protection\\" is translated to \\"Protection diplomatique.\\" The term is used with the same meaning as in English, and it represents the French government's responsibility to shield its citizens from violations of their rights committed by foreign authorities. Here's a more detailed explanation of \\"Protection diplomatique\\" in French: La \\"Protection diplomatique\\" est une notion essentielle dans le droit international, où un État protège les droits de ses citoyens à l'étranger en exerçant ses fonctions diplomatiques et consulaires. L'objectif principal de la protection diplomatique est de garantir que les gouvernements étrangers respectent les droits des ressortissants d'autres États lorsqu'ils se trouvent à l'étranger. En français, \\"Diplomatic protection\\" se traduit par \\"Protection diplomatique.\\" Le terme est utilisé avec la même signification qu'en anglais, et il représente la responsabilité du gouvernement français de protéger ses citoyens contre les violations de leurs droits commises par les autorités étrangères. La protection diplomatique peut être exercée de diverses manières, notamment en envoyant des agents diplomatiques pour assister et aider les citoyens français en cas de détention ou d'arrestation injustifiée ou pour résoudre des litiges civils ou commerciaux. Dans les cas les plus graves, la protection diplomatique peut prendre la forme d'une action en justice devant une juridiction internationale ou d'un recours à des mesures de représailles à l'encontre de l'État fautif. La protection diplomatique est régie par diverses conventions internationales, telles que la Convention de Vienne sur les relations diplomatiques de 1961 et la Convention de Vienne sur les relations consulaires de 1963, qui établissent les droits et les obligations respectifs des États en matière de protection diplomatique. Dans l'ensemble, la protection diplomatique est un moyen essentiel pour les États de défendre leurs ressortissants et de veiller à ce que leurs droits soient respectés à l'étranger.

They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.\\"? Answer:","output":"Question: Analyze the significance of the Stonewall riots and their impact on the development of the gay liberation movement and the struggle for LGBT rights in the United States, taking into consideration the participants, the police raid, and the historical context of the event. To answer this question, students should provide a detailed analysis of the passage, addressing the following aspects: 1. Participants and their actions: The students should mention that the demonstrations were initiated by the gay community, implying that the community was taking an active role in advocating for their rights and showing resistance towards oppressive forces. The spontaneity and violence of these demonstrations indicate the intensity and frustration of the community's need for a change in their treatment by society and the authorities. 2. Police raid: The students should highlight that the Stonewall riots were a reaction against a police raid conducted at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. This indicates that the gay community was tired of facing constant harassment by the authorities, and the raid served as a catalyst for the community to take a stand and collectively demand their rights. 3. Historical context: Students should explain the importance of the Stonewall riots in the broader context of the United States by stating that these events are seen as the single most important catalyst for the gay liberation movement and the contemporary fight for LGBT rights. This demonstrates the magnitude of the riots' influence, as it not only affected the gay community in Lower Manhattan but also had a nationwide impact on the struggle for equal rights regardless of one's sexual orientation or gender identity. Overall, students need to convey how the Stonewall riots marked a turning point in the history of LGBT rights in the United States by bringing attention to the challenges faced by the gay community and inspiring further activism and efforts towards equality. They should underscore the unyielding spirit of the participants, the circumstances surrounding the police raid, and the broader societal implications of this historic event."},{"instruction":"Here is a news article: SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email Amazon.com Inc. spent its first day as the owner of a brick-and-mortar grocery chain cutting prices at Whole Foods Market as much as 43 percent. In a sign of how the retailer is changing, the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated electronic assistant, was also for sale, for 99.99 -- a sharp pivot into electronics for a company known for kale and quinoa. The Echo Dot, a smaller version, was advertised for 44.99. The tech giant’s 13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods has sent shock waves through the already changing 800 billion supermarket industry. The wedding between Amazon and the upscale grocery promises to upend the way customers shop for groceries. Cutting prices at the chain with such an entrenched reputation for high cost that its nickname is Whole Paycheck is a sign that Amazon is serious about taking on competitors such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Kroger Co. and Costco Wholesale Corp. “Price was the largest barrier to Whole Foods’ customers,” said Mark Baum, a senior vice president at the Food Marketing Institute, an industry group. “Amazon has demonstrated that it is willing to invest to dominate the categories that it decides to compete in. Food retailers of all sizes need to look really hard at their pricing strategies, and maybe find some funding sources to build a war chest.” Whole Foods Market is lowering their prices. Photographer: David Williams/Bloomberg How Amazon’s Price Cuts May Not Solve Whole Foods’ Problems: Gadfly At the store on East 57th Street in Manhattan, organic fuji apples were marked down to 1.99 a pound from 3.49 a pound; organic avocados went to 1.99 each from 2.79; organic rotisserie chicken fell to 9.99 each from 13.99, and the price of some bananas was slashed to 49 cents per pound from 79 cents. The marked-down items had orange signs reading “Whole Foods + Amazon.” The signs listed the old price, the new price and “More to come.” Discounts were comparable at other Whole Foods stores in San Francisco and Seattle. Amazon declined to comment. For more on Amazon, check out the Decrypted podcast: In the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, Catherine Oshiro, a 33-year-old product designer, said lower prices may make her change her shopping routine. “I usually buy my staples like toilet paper and paper towels at Target and Safeway,” Oshiro said. “If I see the lower prices at Whole Foods, I would start buying those basics here.” Katie Bennett, 24, was one of many customers who said she hoped Amazon would offer delivery of Whole Foods items. She picked out a rotisserie-cooked half chicken for lunch at the New York store. “Last time I came in, I was thinking about getting the rotisserie chicken, but it was too expensive,” she said. Organic Foods’ Premium Prices and Uncertain Benefits: QuickTake Rivals Adjust Some rivals have already reacted to the kickoff of what could become a new era of selling food in the U.S. Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, has already invested billions into lowering prices across the board over the past year or so, and has revamped the produce section at its U.S stores, improving sight lines, adding more fresh-cut fruits and even creating a sweeter bespoke cantaloupe. That, along with an aggressive rollout of curbside grocery order pickup, helped the company record its best food sales growth in five years in its most recent quarter. Costco, meanwhile, has a full slate of organic items that are priced about 30 percent cheaper than the same products at Whole Foods, according to Sanford Bernstein. It’s able to price lower thanks to a business model that charges membership fees, focuses on selling a limited assortment of bulk-sized goods and features a treasure-hunt experience in the stores.

Amazon shares rose 0.08 percent. “Goodbye, Whole Foods as we know it,” Karen Short, an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York, said in a note. “The conventional supermarket has not evolved much in decades. But Amazon will likely drive drastically different shopping behavior in grocery. The survival of the fittest has begun.” — With assistance by Olivia Zaleski, Laura Yin, Alexandria Arnold, and Spencer Soper ||||| Whole Foods/Facebook Whole Foods just got less expensive.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

Scientists from the Scripps Research Institute in Florida, Harvard Medical School and more than a dozen other institutions developed the novel drug candidate and tested it in rhesus macaques, monkeys which can carry simian HIV, a virus similar to the one that infects humans. They found that macaques inoculated with the drug compound known as eCD4-lg did not catch the virus, even when they were repeatedly exposed to high levels of it over an 8-month period. Results of the study were published today in the journal Nature. In addition to protecting monkeys, the researchers say lab tests indicate the drug candidate blocks every known strain of HIV-1 and HIV-2, the two main types of the virus that infect humans. \\"Our compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,\\" lead researcher Michael Farzan, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute, said in a press statement. \\"Unlike antibodies, which fail to neutralize a large fraction of HIV-1 strains, our protein has been effective against all strains tested, raising the possibility it could offer an effective HIV vaccine alternative.\\" It was built on previous research by Farzan's lab into a receptor called CCR5, which plays a key role in enabling HIV to latch onto the surface of a cell and begin replicating. The new drug compound binds to two sites on the surface of the virus simultaneously, preventing it from infecting a cell. \\"This is the culmination of more than a decade's worth of work on the biochemistry of how HIV enters cells,\\" Farzan said. \\"When we did our original work on CCR5, people thought it was interesting, but no one saw the therapeutic potential. That potential is starting to be realized.\\" To work like a vaccine, the researchers attached eCD4-lg to an adeno-associated virus (AAV), a virus harmless to humans that can be used as a vehicle. Noted AIDS researcher David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate whose firm, Calimmune, is working on a separate gene therapy approach to HIV, told Science he considers these latest findings \\"impressive.\\" But he sounded a note of caution since it's only been tested in a laboratory and in animals. \\"It's perhaps a better construct than the antibodies we've been using, but it's a matter of how it plays out in human trials,\\" Baltimore said. \\"I don't think it's easy to tell how that will happen.\\" ||||| A new study could lead to the first step in new treatments for patients with AIDS and an alternative to a vaccine against HIV. Scripps Institute’s Michael Farzan explains. Photo: AP Scientists have engineered a molecule they say can block infection with the virus that causes AIDS, a discovery that potentially could lead to a new therapy for patients as well as an alternative to a vaccine. Researchers have been trying for three decades to develop an effective vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. They are also searching for a way to cure infected people. But the ever-evolving virus has eluded them. ... ||||| The author, Michael Farzan, an infectious disease specialist at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida, described the new compound as “the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far.” It is simpler and works better, he said, than the current method that scientists are experimenting with: giving monkeys cocktails of several different antibodies that each neutralize only one or two strains of H.I.V., sometimes imperfectly. Blocking H.I.V. A new protein may be able to block H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, from entering and infecting human cells. Envelope protein CCR5 binding site New protein blocks both sites H.I.V. CD4 binding site Antibody blocks CD4 site CD4 CCR5 Cell INFECTING A CELL NORMAL ANTIBODIES AN ANTIBODY-LIKE PROTEIN H.I.V. is covered with small spikes that enable it to attach to two receptors, called CD4 and CCR5, on the surface of a target cell. Each spike has a three-lobed structure with two types of binding sites. Antibodies can block one type of site, but not both. A new protein resembling an antibody with a tail seems to block both sites, preventing the virus from binding to and entering the cell. Envelope protein H.I.V.

New protein blocks both sites AN ANTIBODY-LIKE PROTEIN A new protein resembling an antibody with a tail seems to block both sites, preventing the virus from binding to and entering the cell. The study was published online by the journal Nature. Describing over the telephone the way his new compound worked, Dr. Farzan said he was bending his hand into a claw, with his thumb representing the end blocking one site and two fingers blocking the other. “One of my colleagues told me it’s the grip for a two-seam cut fastball,” he said. The work was led by scientists at his institute but involved researchers from Harvard, Princeton, Rockefeller University, the University of Southern California, the Pasteur Institute in France and elsewhere. The next step, Dr. Farzan said, will be to test the compound in infected monkeys and see if it can stop the virus from replicating further, which is what antiretroviral medicines do. If that proves safe and effective, he said, he hopes to start human trials in three stages. In the first, humans would be injected every few weeks with just the antibody-like protein, not with the vector that stimulates muscle cells to produce it. If that were successful, the vector would be injected into humans who already have H.I.V. but are not taking antiretroviral pills because they refuse, forget or experience bad side effects. Finally, the compound would be given to healthy people at high risk — such as gay men who have frequent unprotected sex with strangers — to see if it protects them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The new approach uses cutting-edge techniques that are not widely known, or even entirely understood, by the scientists experimenting with them. Historically, vaccines have been made by killing or weakening whole viruses and injecting them; that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that recognize and attack the real virus when it arrives. Photo Newer vaccines splice genes for particular antibodies into other weakened viruses. Generally, the genes are carried into a cell by the virus, incorporated into the cell’s genome, and begin producing the necessary antibodies. But this new method splices the desired gene into a stretch of DNA so short that it cannot function like a virus at all and does not deserve to be called one, Dr. Farzan said, who refers to it simply as “a gene therapy vector.” It does not integrate itself into the DNA of a cell or replicate itself. (Yet it is sometimes called an A.A.V., short for “adeno-associated virus,” even though that causes confusion, said Dr. Farzan.) Nonetheless, injecting that vector into muscle stimulates cells to produce the antibody-like protein encoded by the gene.

We’re not really able to answer that question,” Dr. Farzan said. “But it does.” H.I.V. normally targets CD4 cells, white blood cells that act as the sentinels of the immune system. The virus invades them by attaching its outer spikes — known as envelope proteins — to two different receptors on the outside of the cell. First it attaches to the CD4 receptor; that exposes the CCR5 receptor. Once attached to both, the virus can inject its RNA into the cell and hijack its inner machinery to produce more virus. But the protein produced by Dr. Farzan, bent into its claw shape, blocks both the CD4-binding site and the CCR5-binding site. It does so in a very tight “match” difficult for the virus to block by means of “escape mutations” — changes in shape that partly prevent engineered antibodies from attaching. “It fools the virus into thinking it’s interacting with a cell,” Dr. Farzan said. Dr. Philip R. Johnson, director of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute and the inventor of the vector that Dr. Farzan used, called the new approach “good stuff.” “It appears to be as good as, if not better than, anything else that’s being tried,” he said. Eventually, he said, he would like to see an approach that combined known antibodies and the new protein “so we could target two or three areas on the virus.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Scientists have created a new drug compound called eCD4-lg that shows promise in protecting against the virus that causes AIDS.

Options: - yes - no Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Yes, the claim \\"People around the world celebrate the Christmas holiday\\" is true. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to support this conclusion: 1. Christmas is a Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. Christianity is the world's largest religion, with approximately 2.3 billion followers worldwide. 2. Due to the number of Christians around the world and the influence of Christianity on many cultures and societies, Christmas is celebrated in varying ways across the globe. People from different countries and cultural backgrounds may have different customs and traditions associated with their celebration of Christmas. 3. In addition to religious celebrations, Christmas has also become a secular cultural event, with many non-Christians participating in the festivities. This further increases the number of people who celebrate Christmas. 4. Globalization and cultural exchange have allowed Christmas traditions to spread to regions where Christianity is not the majority religion. In some cases, Christmas is celebrated as a commercial event or a way to enjoy time with family and friends, regardless of religious beliefs. Therefore, the statement \\"People around the world celebrate the Christmas holiday\\" is accurate, as Christmas is celebrated both as a religious holiday for Christians and a cultural event in many countries."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - Is exposed to air - A chemical reaction occurs - The iron starts to oxidize - The iron starts to rust.

Especially if you have been actively using Facebook for years. This is going to take a while. Fresh off its global debut in New Zealand, Facebook is rolling out its new profile design to all of its more than 800 million users. For the first time, they are getting a look at how their lives are about to appear to all of their friends. Facebook said in a blog post Thursday that users can either wait for a notification to pop up on their screen or go to facebook.com/about/timeline to get Timeline right away. No point in foot dragging: Eventually all profiles will switch to the new look. That means that all of those forgotten memories won't be lining the dustbin of your personal history for long. The new design has a way of bringing even the most mundane status update rushing back. It used to be that profiles surfaced only the most recent stuff. But Timeline is like an obsessive compulsive's digital scrapbook, collecting every detail, no matter how trivial, in chronological order. It may get people to think twice about what they do and say on Facebook. Or not. It's likely that a lot of people will look at the new profile, throw up their hands and just keep on doing what they've been doing. For now, it probably means that everyone with a Facebook profile is going to spend a lot of time perusing, pruning and doing a whole lot of adding. Take it from me: I used a workaround meant for software developers and got Timeline shortly after Mark Zuckerberg unveiled it in late September during Facebook's annual developer conference in San Francisco. I could see what was happening in my life years ago as clearly as today. I proceeded to pore over my profile to highlight what was important to me and hide what wasn't. I also noticed a lot of other folks getting busy adding photos from important moments in their lives to better reflect their lives on Facebook. It goes without saying that some people will love the new design and some will hate it. It's impossible to make even the smallest change on Facebook without upsetting someone. If you make the switch now, you have seven days to preview the changes, highlight or hide whatever you want and adjust your privacy settings before Timeline becomes your official Facebook profile. If you want to see how your Facebook profile appears to other people, click the gear menu at the top of Timeline and click on \\"View As.\\" RELATED: How to get the new Facebook \\"Timeline\\" now New Zealand is first country to get Facebook's Timeline feature Facebook updates its status: It wants to be an entertainment hub -- Jessica Guynn Image: Facebook's new profile design Timeline Courtesy: Facebook ||||| When Facebook rolled out their latest changes, a lot of longtime users did some major eye-rolling. \\"Here we go again,\\" a lot of users thought. At first the changes seemed confusing and a bit of overkill. I sat in a session at BlogWorld taught by Amy Porterfield and she began digging into the new changes. She asserts that regarding the \\"Facebook changes for businesses, the changes are good -- if you leverage the new features fully.\\" Additionally, she stated that: \\"The more robust personal Profiles make it possible to combine our business and personal lives intelligently for the first time on Facebook. Plus, Facebook is introducing its most graphically superior layout yet. It doesn't just look good -- content and data are easier to understand. Considering that there are 800 million global users and counting, this puts business owners in a great position to showcase their content, grow their audience and increase exposure.\\" First and foremost though, Amy said that the new changes are very, very content driven. So, in order to maximize these, you'll need to be very content focused. 1) Facebook has a new subscribe button, can you tell us how best to use that? There are still two primary platforms for communicating on Facebook -- your Profile, which is your personal page (originally designed to maintain personal connections), and business Pages, which are more like digital storefronts for brands. I used to tell my clients to spend 80 percent of their Facebook marketing efforts on their business Page. Now with the rollout of the new Subscribe button, some of that energy needs to go to your Profile too. Implementing the Subscribe button which you can do here allows users, including non-friends, to subscribe to your public updates in their News Feeds. Subscribing is just like following someone on Twitter or adding them to a Google+ circle; it doesn't need to be mutual. If you add a Subscribe button to their Profile, anyone can subscribe without any approvals needed. You choose what content to make public from a drop-down within your status update box. Existing friends are automatically subscribed to your updates, but now, potential clients, readers, and fans you've never met can subscribe to your public updates. It's the first time Facebook is addressing the fact that some \\"Friends\\" aren't friends at all. Consider it a welcome update: You can now combine your business life and personal life without sacrificing privacy. I have almost 5,000 Friends on Facebook, largely because I didn't want to turn away potential clients. Now, I can separate the Business Amy from Personal Amy without sacrificing privacy -- and I have a new platform to promote my personal brand. 2) We hear a lot about \\"intent driven content\\"; can you tell us what that is and how to use it? Now that you can have subscribers to your Profile, fans of your Page, and regular Friends on Facebook, you can reach more people than ever before with your content. But users can also tune you out more easily -- so use those public Profile updates wisely. Highlighted Stories (which have a blue triangle in the upper left corner of the post) have replaced \\"Top News\\" in the News Feed. You can still toggle between Highlighted and Recent Stories, but by default, Highlighted are at the top of your feed. These stories are largely determined by our interactions on Facebook. They're also determined by you: you can hover over any recent story and ask Facebook to highlight it. When you do, Facebook will start putting more similar content (and more updates from that Profile or Page) at the top of your feed. The more information you give Facebook, the more personalized Highlighted Stories become. So how do those of us with products, services and programs to promote ensure OUR content shoots to the top of News Feeds everywhere? Produce better content. Grab readers' attention with posts that entertain, educate and inspire -- also called \\"intent-driven content,\\" because every post is crafted with the intent to get readers involved and to take action. Intent-driven content: Entertains -- With personal anecdotes, humor, or visuals (photo and video). Educates -- Meaty posts include statistics, links, numbers and other useful facts to flesh out your content's purpose and value. Empowers -- It gives readers a lesson, direction or takeaway, empowering them to take action. Plus, Facebook has expanded the post space to 5,000 characters and has made photos and videos larger, allowing you to essentially micro-blog right on your Profile or Page. But while the potential rewards are enormous, so are the risks -- because users now have more powerful one-click filtering options. For example, you can UN-highlight stories or even hide a Profile or Page's updates entirely, right from your feed. And you can unsubscribe from certain types of content (status updates, activity, photos, games, etc.), un-Like pages or un-Friend Friends just by hovering over the update or poster's name. Users can even unsubscribe from updates from third-party apps -- so if you're using a tool to post and manage your Facebook updates, it may be time to attempt to post in real-time as much as possible. All these new ways to filter posts may sound scary, but ultimately, these new filters are a way for Facebook to make the user experience better. If you're not giving readers value, they will use these filters to tune you out. Relevant, useful content is your tool -- use it wisely, or get booted off the island. 3) Can you explain the Real-Time Ticker and how best to use it? Another important feature of the updated News Feed is the real-time Ticker -- that streaming, chronological accounting of your Friends' and Liked Pages' activities in real-time, scrolling in the top right corner of your News Feed. By simply hovering over a Ticker story, a user can comment, like your Page, subscribe to your Profile, view the photo or status update, and even watch videos you post, in a pop-up window. It's easier than ever for people to interact with your content -- and every time someone interacts with a Page, Profile, event or piece of content you post, it appears in the Tickers of every single one of their Friends and subscribers. So the more engagement your content inspires, the more exposure it gets, and the longer it lives on in the Ticker. Your exposure can multiply exponentially -- if it inspires engagement. Focus on creating well-written headlines and intent-driven content. Remember, the more people interact with a post, the more exposure YOU get. 4) Can you explain how to use the Timeline Profile? What are the benefits? The new Timeline Profile layout is currently rolling out to Facebook users -- if you don't have it yet, you will soon. (To activate the Timeline now, follow these instructions.) If you do not have the new Timeline layout activated on your Profile, you won't be able to see any of the Timelines on Facebook. Once you switch over, you'll begin to see all the Timelines of your Friends as well. The new Timeline Profile layout gives businesses even more ways to market content on Profiles. If you have the new Timeline, hover on any post's top right corner. You'll see a little star. Click on it -- the post expands across the Timeline layout, while everything below it remains in the two-column Timeline format. This new feature allows you to make some posts stand out more than others -- giving you more opportunities to feature your best content. To maximize your results, get strategic about which posts you feature. Spend a little extra time crafting a great headline, and use a compelling photo so the post stands out even more. Give people just enough information that they're compelled to click -- especially if you're sending them to your blog or a landing page. And, as with all social media, mix it up and keep your content fresh. Combine featured posts with smaller posts throughout the week so the featured content clearly stands out. Your subscribers will appreciate the gesture. Like a \\"Top Posts\\"plugin on a blog, you're helping people quickly find your most valuable or newsworthy content. 5) Can you explain the new Timeline Photo and how can we use it to maximize our work on Facebook? The first thing people see when they visit the Timeline version of your Facebook Profile is an image across the entire top of the page. And here's what's great -- it's a large image and if you want to get creative, you can design the image and then upload it. The branding opportunities with the Timeline image are endless. To see some fun examples of some Timeline photos, click here. For most of us, life has two dimensions: personal and business. If you want to use your Timeline Profile to highlight your personal life as well as gain exposure for your brand, the new Timeline image can give you a unique visual opportunity to highlight both. Facebook calls the Timeline a \\"living scrapbook.\\" I think that's a great description; the Timeline is all about the real you, and that's why I encourage you to use this image to highlight both work and play. If you have already installed the Timeline on your profile, check out my own Facebook Timeline profile image. I created an image that includes a montage of photos from my personal life as well as photos related to my business: http://www.facebook.com/amyporterfield. It might just spark some ideas for your own Timeline image! (Aside: If you want to design your own image, the specs are 851 x 315 pixels.) As with every one of the changes we've covered here, the Timeline photo is a way to expand your Profile's reach. Keep it fun and authentic. After all, your Profile may become your brand's new hub. Instead of fearing every Facebook rollout, it's time for us to focus on creating content our fans and subscribers care about. That's what will keep you ahead of the curve -- and it's what content marketing is supposed to be about. These changes only emphasize that reality. The only question is, will you take advantage of the opportunity to grow your own audience? Give us your thoughts below!

Facebook announced Timelines in September, but rolled the feature out slowly. If you're just getting Timelines now, or want to speed up the switch from your existing profile, here's what you need to know. What are Timelines? Timelines are Facebook's attempt to tell the story of your life, based on your social networking activity. Presented in reverse chronological order, your Timeline shows status updates, photos, life events and new friends. Timelines also summarize your activity from Facebook apps. For instance, if you've allowed Spotify to automatically tell Facebook what songs you're listening to, a summary of your tastes in music will appear in the Timeline. Or if you've been using Nike+ GPS, your friends will be able to see where you've been running. How to tweak Timeline information Of course, some Facebook activity is best forgotten. To remove a status update, photo or other activity from your Timeline, float your cursor over the top-right corner of the update, click the pencil icon, then select \\"Hide from Timeline.\\" Adding information to the Timeline is also pretty simple. Just hover your cursor over the line down the center of the page, so it turns into a \\"+\\" icon, then click on the kind of update you want to add. You can add events all the way back to your birth, making for a complete life story. [SEE RELATED STORY: Facebook's New Timeline Layout: A Getting-Started Guide] If you really like something that's on your Timeline, you can blow it up into a feature-size post by hovering over the update and clicking the star icon. Controlling who sees what Your existing privacy settings will still apply in your Timeline. For example, if only friends can see photos in which you've been tagged, no one else will see those photos on your Timeline. And if you've hidden a status update from a specific user, that person won't see the update on your Timeline page. Use Facebook's privacy settings page to make adjustments. You can also adjust privacy for anything you've posted, such as status updates and photos, by clicking on the gear icon near the top of the update. To see what your Timeline looks like to the public or to specific users, click the gear icon on the top-right side of the page (next to the \\"Activity Log\\" button), then select \\"View As.\\" How to get Timelines Head to Facebook's \\"Introducing Timeline\\" page, and click \\"Get It Now\\" to activate the feature. Or, you can wait to see an announcement for Timelines at the top of your profile page. Once you make the switch, Facebook will generate a Timeline on its own, but won't immediately publish it. You'll have seven days to make adjustments -- say, to remove references to jobs you hated or significant others you'd rather forget. After that, there's no going back to the old profile.

It was so funny we had to rent it again the next day, and again I laughed so hard I was literally rolling on the floor. (This usually only happens when I see Monty Python's \\"Scott of the Antarctic\\".) Throughout the whole movie, an overwhelming what-the-heck-feeling firmly grasps the viewer. I'm utterly confounded that this clumsy home video ever made it to production stage. It's supposed to be a sequel, yet has no apparent connection whatsoever with the first film. The hero has the same name, but this time \\"Alex\\" is female, although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing, what with all the muscles and the barbarian-nomad outfit! There is really no plot at all, it's merely a prolonged chase scene, only it's so slow-paced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue, which is just as well considering the quality of it, and then the film suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions, without ever really explaining what it was all about. Luckily, it never gets boring, because there's something silly and phony going on at all times! Terrible movies are usually just tedious, but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of over-seriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that it's truly entertaining.

Question: Who plays Steve Jobs? Movie plot title: Pirates of Silicon Valley Movie plot: Steve Jobs (Noah Wyle) is speaking with director Ridley Scott (J. G. Hertzler), about the creation of the 1984 commercial for Apple Computer, which introduced the first Macintosh. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \\"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial. Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve Wozniak or \\"WOZ\\" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \\"got from there to here,\\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple. The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\\" Wozniak then comments that \\"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe. Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), and Gatesâ high school friend Paul Allen (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard.

Options: (A) 3 year (B) 4 year (C) 6 year (D) 5 year (E) 7 year Let's think first. Some random reasoning:","output":"To answer this question, we need to use the simple interest formula: Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal Amount (P) * Rate of Interest (R) * Time (T)) / 100 We are given the following information: Principal Amount (P) = 500 Simple Interest (SI) = 100 Rate of Interest (R) = 5% per annum Now we need to find the time (T).

Multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the denominator: 10000 = 500 * 5 * T 2. Simplify by multiplying the principal amount with the rate of interest: 10000 = 2500 * T 3. Divide both sides by 2500 to find T: T = 10000 / 2500 T = 4 (years) Based on our calculations, it will take 4 years for an amount of 500 to yield 100 as interest at 5% per annum of simple interest.

They are characterized by a very long, slender bill and crypsis, or camouflage, plumage. The \\"Gallinago\\" snipes have a nearly worldwide distribution, the \\"Lymnocryptes\\" snipe is restricted to Asia and Europe and the \\"Coenocorypha\\" snipes are found only in the Outlying Islands of New Zealand. The three species of painted snipe are not closely related to the typical snipes, and are placed in their own family, the Rostratulidae. - Perekop is an urban-type settlement located on the Perekop Isthmus connecting the Crimean peninsula to the Ukrainian mainland. It is known for the Fortress Or Qapi that served as the gateway to Crimea. The village currently is part of Armyansk Municipality. Population: - Army Group North was a German strategic echelon formation, commanding a grouping of field armies during World War II. The army group was subordinated to the \\"Oberkommando des Heeres\\" (OKH), the German army high command, and coordinated the operations of attached separate army corps, reserve formations, rear services and logistics. - A blockade is an effort to cut off supplies, war material or communications from a particular area by force, either in part or totally. A blockade should not be confused with an embargo or sanctions, which are legal barriers to trade. It is also distinct from a siege in that a blockade is usually directed at an entire country or region, rather than a fortress or city. While most blockades historically took place at sea, blockade is still used on land to prevent someone coming into a certain area. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - Kyra Petrovskaya Wayne ( born December 31 , 1918 , Crimea ) is a Russian - born American author . In Russia she was an actress and a sniper during World War II and a survivor of the Siege of Leningrad . She married an American diplomat and came to the United States , becoming the author of 14 books . Among her various activities in America , she made many appearances on television programs , gave lectures on literature and history on cruise ships , and sang on concert stages . - A sniper is a marksman or qualified specialist who operates alone, in a pair, or with a sniper team to maintain close visual contact with the enemy and shoot enemies from concealed positions or distances exceeding the detection capabilities of enemy personnel. Snipers typically have highly-selective or specialized training and use crew-served high-precision/special application rifles and optics, and often have sophisticated communication assets to feed valuable combat information back to their units or military bases. - The Arabat Spit or Arabat Arrow is a spit (narrow strip of land) which separates a large, shallow and very salty system of lagoons named Syvash from the Sea of Azov. The spit is located between the Henichesk Strait to the north and the north-eastern shores of Crimea to the south. - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - The Isthmus of Perekop (translit. \\"Perekops'kyy pereshyyok\\" translit. \\"Perekopskiy peresheek\\" ) is the narrow, wide strip of land that connects the Crimean Peninsula to the mainland of Ukraine. The isthmus is located between the Black Sea to the west and the Sivash to the east. The isthmus takes its name from the Tatar fortress of Perekop. - The Crimean Peninsula (\\"Krymskiy poluostrov;\\" , \\"Kryms'ky pivostriv\\"), also known simply as Crimea ( \\"Krym\\" \\"Krym\\"), is a major land mass on the northern coast of the Black Sea that is almost completely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast. The peninsula is located south of the Ukrainian region of Kherson and west of the Russian region of Kuban. It is connected to Kherson Oblast by the Isthmus of Perekop and is separated from Kuban by the Strait of Kerch. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - A marksman (also known as a sharpshooter) is a person who is skilled in precision shooting, using projectile weapons, usually with a rifle but most commonly with a designated marksman rifle or a special application rifle, to shoot at long range targets. In popular and historical usage, \\"sharpshooter\\" and \\"marksman\\" are considered synonyms. Within the shooting sports and military usages today, however, sharpshooter and marksman refer to distinctly different levels of skill, which are never conflated. Specifically, in the US Army, \\"marksman\\" is a rating below \\"sharpshooter\\" and \\"expert\\". Four levels of skill are generally recognized today in both military and civilian shooting circles: unqualified, marksman, sharpshooter, and expert. Marksmanship badges for the three qualified levels are commonly awarded to both civilian and military shooters who attain proficiency in shooting higher than \\"unqualified\\". - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\" - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Kerch (, Old East Slavic: , , , Ancient Greek: \\"Pantikapaion\\") is a city of regional significance on the Kerch Peninsula in the east of the Crimea. Population: - Kherson Oblast (translit. \\"Khersonska oblast\\"; also referred to as Khersonshchyna \\"\\") is an oblast (province) in southern Ukraine, just north of Crimea. Its administrative center is Kherson. The area of the region is 28,461 km², its population (as of 1 January 2012) is 1,083,367. - A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault. This derives from \\"sedere\\", Latin for \\"to sit\\". Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow. - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about . - The Sea of Azov (\\"Azovs'ke more/Azovke more\\") is a sea in Eastern Europe. To the south it is linked by the narrow (about ) Strait of Kerch to the Black Sea, and it is sometimes regarded as a northern extension of the Black Sea. The sea is bounded in the north by mainland Ukraine, in the east by Russia, and in the west by the Crimean Peninsula. The Don and Kuban are the major rivers that flow into it. The Sea of Azov is the shallowest sea in the world, with the depth varying between . There is a constant outflow of water from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. - The Siege of Leningrad, also known as the Leningrad Blockade (transliteration: \\"blokada Leningrada\\") was a prolonged military blockade undertaken mainly by the German Army Group North against Leningrad, historically and currently known as Saint Petersburg, in the Eastern Front theatre of World War II. The siege started on 8 September 1941, when the last road to the city was severed. Although the Soviets managed to open a narrow land corridor to the city on 18 January 1943, the siege was only lifted on 27 January 1944, 872 days after it began. It was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history and possibly the costliest in terms of casualties. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Kuban is a geographic region of Southern Russia surrounding the Kuban River, on the Black Sea between the Don Steppe, the Volga Delta and the Caucasus, and separated from the Crimean Peninsula to the west by the Kerch Strait. Krasnodar Krai is often referred to as \\"Kuban\\", both officially and unofficially, although the term is not exclusive to the krai and accommodates the republics of Adygea, KarachayCherkessia, and parts of Stavropol Krai.

The minimum height to ride the roller coaster is 140 cm. Mary's brother is 180 cm, Mary is 2/3 the height of her brother. How many more centimeters does Mary need to grow to ride Kingda Ka? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","output":"1. Determine Mary's current height: We know that Mary's height is 2/3 (two-thirds) the height of her brother, who is 180 cm tall. 2. Calculate the fraction of her brother's height: To find Mary's current height, multiply her brother's height (180 cm) by the fraction 2/3: 180 cm * (2/3) = 120 cm So, Mary is currently 120 cm tall. 3. Calculate the difference between the minimum height to ride Kingda Ka and Mary's height: Since the minimum height requirement is 140 cm, and Mary is 120 cm tall, we'll subtract her current height from the requirement: 140 cm - 120 cm = 20 cm 4.

The French word \\"Produits\\" translates to \\"Products\\" in English. Now, when the term \\"products\\" is mentioned, it usually refers to the result of a manufacturing process, which can be goods or services, created to fulfill specific needs or desires of consumers. Products can encompass various categories, including tangible goods, digital items, services, or even experiences. Here's a detailed and in-depth explanation of the concept of products, as well as their characteristics and classification. 1. Characteristics of products: A comprehensive understanding of a product can be achieved by analyzing its various characteristics. Some key features are: a. Tangibility: The product's physical or tangible existence can be touched, smelled, tasted, or seen. b. Perishability: The product may have a limited life and can expire or go bad over time. c. Demand: The appeal or need for the product from consumers influences its success in the market. d. Differentiation: Products can have unique features or qualities that set them apart from competitors. e. Value: The product offers benefits or satisfaction to consumers that can fulfill their needs or desires. 2. Classification of products: Products can be classified based on various aspects such as functionality, market segmentation, and ownership. Here are some broad categories: a. Consumer products: These are products created for personal use or consumption by everyday individuals. They can be further divided into other categories, such as convenience products, specialty products, shopping products, and unsought products. b. Industrial products: These are products used by businesses and industries in their manufacturing processes or for offering services. Examples include raw materials, machinery, or office supplies. c. Services: Services are intangible products that don't have a physical form, but rather offer value through experiences, expertise, or activities. Examples include healthcare, education, and transportation. d. Digital products: These are non-tangible items that exist online or in electronic format, such as software, ebooks, or digital courses. 3. Product life cycle: Another essential aspect of understanding a product is its life cycle – how it performs in the market throughout its existence. The product life cycle consists of four main stages: a. Introduction: This is the initial stage when the product is introduced to the market, with relatively low sales and high costs. b. Growth: In this phase, sales begin to increase rapidly, and the product gains popularity among consumers. c. Maturity: The product reaches its peak sales, and the growth rate starts to decline as the market becomes saturated. d. Decline: This is the final stage where sales and profitability diminish due to market saturation, competition, or technological advancements. In conclusion, products are an essential aspect of our lives as they provide various benefits, fulfill our needs and desires, and contribute to the economy. Understanding the characteristics, classifications, and life cycle of products helps us grasp their importance and role within the realms of business and society."},{"instruction":"My question: Claim: \\"Honda Civic responsible for the vast majority of safety defects in the automobile industry.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?

The Turks almost captured Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684, joined by Tsarist Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Mohács in 1687 and a decade later, in 1697, the battle of Zenta. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldovia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth.

Sentence 2: \\"There are people listening all around us.\\" This sentence is a claim that there are people in the surrounding area who are paying attention to the conversation or noise being generated. This sentence does not depend on the first sentence, and it is presented as a fact. Now, let's consider the question: \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" The question is asking if the truth of the first statement (the need to keep one's voice down) guarantees the truth of the second statement (that there are people listening around). While Sentence 1 suggests that there may be a reason to be cautious of people overhearing the conversation, it does not guarantee the presence of listeners all around. It is possible that there are listeners, but Sentence 1 doesn't directly confirm their existence in its current form. The first sentence could be true because there might be specific reasons or situations where one needs to keep their voice down (e.g., discussing sensitive information), but this does not necessarily mean that there are people actively listening all around. Therefore, the correct response is (b). It is not possible to tell if the second sentence is true based solely on the truth of the first sentence. The two sentences, as they are presented, do not provide enough information to definitively establish a direct causal relationship between them."},{"instruction":"Title: Best book on the subject so far Review: Even though Dr. Kerzner mentions \\"Knowledge Management\\" (KM) throughout the book many, many times and how important it is in the PM world (in one form or another), an actual chapter/subchapter on KM is regretfully missing.

He is known as the \\"Holy Prophet\\" to Muslims, almost all of whom consider him to be the last prophet sent by God to mankind to restore Islam, believed by Muslims to be the unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity and ensured that his teachings, practices, and the Quran, formed the basis of Islamic religious belief. - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - A Muslim is someone who follows or practises Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\\"sunnah \\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\\"hadith\\"). \\"Muslim\\" is an Arabic word meaning \\"one who submits (to God)\\". - Abraham (Avraham), originally Abram, is the first of the three patriarchs of Judaism. His story features in the holy texts of all the Abrahamic religions and Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - The Talmud (Hebrew: ' \\"instruction, learning\\", from a root ' \\"teach, study\\") is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism. It is also traditionally referred to as, a Hebrew abbreviation of ', the \\"six orders\\", a reference to the six orders of the Mishnah. The term \\"Talmud\\" normally refers to the collection of writings named specifically the Babylonian Talmud \\"(Talmud Bavli)\\", although there is also an earlier collection known as the Jerusalem Talmud, or Palestinian Talmud\\"' \\"(Talmud Yerushalmi)\\". When referring to post-biblical periods, namely those of the creation of the Talmud, the Talmudic academies and the Babylonian exilarchate, Jewish sources use the term \\"Babylonia\\" long after it had become obsolete in geopolitical terms. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Sunnah (, , plural ) is the verbally transmitted record of the teachings, deeds and sayings, silent permissions (or disapprovals) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, as well as various reports about Muhammad's companions. Along with the Quran (the holy book of Islam), the Sunnah makes up the two primary sources of Islamic theology and law. The \\"Sunna\\" is also defined as \\"a path, a way, a manner of life\\"; \\"all the traditions and practices\\" of the Islamic prophet that \\"have become models to be followed\\" by Muslims. - Hagar ( of uncertain origin Hjar) is a biblical person in the Book of Genesis. She was an Egyptian handmaid of Sarai (Sarah), who gave her to Abraham to bear a child. The product of the union was Abraham's firstborn, Ishmael, the progenitor of the Ishmaelites. According to Theodor Nöldeke, she is the biblical personification of the nomadic Hagrites. - In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving. - Supreme Being is a term for God used by theologians and philosophers of many religious faiths, including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and deism. - Augury is the practice from ancient Roman religion of interpreting omens from the observed flight of birds (\\"aves\\"). When the individual, known as the augur, interpreted these signs, it is referred to as \\"taking the auspices\\". 'Augur' and 'auspices' are from the Latin \\"auspicium\\" and \\"auspex\\", literally \\"one who looks at birds.\\" Depending upon the birds, the auspices from the gods could be favorable or unfavorable (\\"auspicious\\" or \\"inauspicious\\"). Sometimes bribed or politically motivated augures would fabricate unfavorable auspices in order to delay certain state functions, such as elections. Pliny the Elder attributes the invention of auspicy to Tiresias the seer of Thebes, the generic model of a seer in the Greco-Roman literary culture. - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\" - In Judaism, the midrash (pl. ') is the genre of rabbinic literature which contains early interpretations and commentaries on the Written Torah and Oral Torah (spoken law and sermons), as well as non-legalistic rabbinic literature (') and occasionally the Jewish religious laws ('), which usually form a running commentary on specific passages in the Hebrew Scripture ('). - Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends. A commonplace example might be estimation of some variable of interest at some specified future date. Prediction is a similar, but more general term. Both might refer to formal statistical methods employing time series, cross-sectional or longitudinal data, or alternatively to less formal judgmental methods. Usage can differ between areas of application: for example, in hydrology the terms \\"forecast\\" and \\"forecasting\\" are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific future times, while the term \\"prediction\\" is used for more general estimates, such as the number of times floods will occur over a long period. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized. - Patriarchy is a social system in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. In the domain of the family, fathers or father-figures hold authority over women and children. Some patriarchal societies are also patrilineal, meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage. - Originally, a patriarch was a man who exercised autocratic authority as a pater familias over an extended family. The system of such rule of families by senior males is termed patriarchy. - Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - A hadith (or plural: ahadith, ) is one of various reports describing the words, actions, or habits of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The term comes from Arabic meaning a \\"report\\", \\"account\\" or \\"narrative\\". Hadith are second only to the Quran in developing Islamic jurisprudence, and regarded as important tools for understanding the Quran and commentaries (\\"tafsir\\") written on it. Some important elements of traditional Islam, such as the five salat prayers, are mentioned in hadith. - The pater familias, also written as paterfamilias (plural \\"patres familias\\"), was the head of a Roman family. The \\"pater familias\\" was the oldest living male in a household. He had complete control of all family members. The term is Latin for \\"father of the family\\" or the \\"owner of the family estate\\". The form is archaic in Latin, preserving the old genitive ending in (see Latin declension), whereas in classical Latin the normal genitive ending was . The \\"pater familias\\" was always a Roman citizen. - Sarah or Sara (; \\"arra\\" Arabic: \\"Sra\\";) was the wife and also the halfsister of Abraham and the mother of Isaac as described in the Hebrew Bible and the Quran. Her name was originally Sarai. According to Genesis 17:15, God changed her name to Sarah as part of a covenant after Hagar bore Abraham his first son, Ishmael. - In religion, a prophet is an individual who has claimed to have been contacted by the supernatural or the divine, and to speak for them, serving as an intermediary with humanity, delivering this newfound knowledge from the supernatural source to other people. The message that the prophet conveys is called a prophecy, which transports at least in Judaism a message beyond mere pagan soothsaying, augury, divination, or forecasting, and, most prominently in the neviim of the Tanakh, often comprises issues of social justice. - Omniscience , mainly in religion, is the capacity to know everything that there is to know. In particular, Dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism) and the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) believe that there is a divine being who is omniscient. An omniscient point-of-view, in writing, is to know everything that can be known about a character, including past history, thoughts, feelings, etc. In Latin, \\"omnis\\" means \\"all\\" and \\"science\\" means \\"knowing\\". - Prophecy involves a process in which one or more messages are allegedly communicated to a prophet by a god or spirit and often are then communicated to other people. Such messages typically involve inspiration, interpretation, or revelation of events to come (compare divine knowledge). Prophecy is not limited to any one culture. It is a common property to all known ancient societies around the world, some more than others. Many systems and rules about prophecy have been proposed over several millennia. - Theism, in the field of comparative religion, or when contrasted with atheism, is broadly defined as the belief in the existence of a deity or deities. In popular parlance, or when contrasted with \\"deism\\", the term often describes the classical conception of god(s) that is found in the monotheistic and polytheistic religions; a belief in a god or in gods without the rejection of revelation as is characteristic of deism. - Omnipresence or ubiquity is the property of being present everywhere. This property is most commonly used in a religious context as an attribute of a deity or supreme being. - The Quran (; ', literally meaning \\"the recitation\\"; also romanized Qur'an or Koran\\"') is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (\\"Allah\\"). It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. The Quran is divided into chapters (\\"surah\\" in Arabic), which are then divided into verses (\\"ayah\\"). - Isaac ( Arabic : or ( note A ) Isq ) is recognized as a patriarch , prophet and messenger of God by all Muslims . In Islam , he is known as Ishaq . As in Judaism and Christianity , Islam maintains that Isaac was the son of the prophet Ibrahim , from his wife Sarah . Muslims regard Isaac as highly important because they believe that it was Isaac and his older half - brother Ismail who continued their father 's legacy and preached the message of God after the death of Abraham . - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Isaac (\\"Yiçaq\\", \\"[he] will laugh\\"; \\"Isaak\\"; or \\"\\") as described in the Hebrew Bible and the Qur'an, was the second son of Abraham, the only son Abraham had with his wife Sarah, and the father of Jacob and Esau. According to the Book of Genesis, Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born, and Sarah was past 90. - The Torah (\\"instruction, teaching\\"), or in Christianity, the Pentateuch (\\"five books\\"), is the central reference of the religious Judaic tradition. It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice. Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws ('). - In theology, the doctrine of divine simplicity says that God is without parts. The general idea of divine simplicity can be stated in this way: the being of God is identical to the \\"attributes\\" of God. In other words, such characteristics as omnipresence, goodness, truth, eternity, etc. are identical to God's being, not qualities that make up that being, nor abstract entities inhering in God as in a substance. Varieties of the doctrine may be found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the height of scholasticism, though the doctrine's origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus' \\"Enneads\\" as the Simplex. - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"Damage to the kidney can have serious consequences on its ability to filter waste and excess substances from the blood properly. In this case, the supposed perturbation can be categorized as \\"directly impacting a step of the process.\\" When kidney damage occurs, it can interfere with the normal functioning of the nephrons, the filtering units of the kidneys, and may consequently have a direct effect on the blood filtration process. The kidney is an essential organ for maintaining homeostasis within the body. It performs three major functions: waste excretion, regulation of blood volume and blood pressure, and the control and maintenance of electrolyte and acid-base balance in the body. The kidneys achieve these functions through a complex and delicate process involving multiple steps, with the nephrons playing a critical role in carrying out these tasks efficiently. Nephrons comprise a glomerulus (a network of capillaries) and a renal tubule (a tubular structure), both of which have important roles in blood filtration. When damage to the kidney occurs, the glomerulus, renal tubules, or both may be affected, thereby altering the blood filtration process. Some possible effects of kidney damage on the blood filtration process include: 1. Reduced filtration capacity: Kidney damage can cause the glomeruli to lose their ability to filter blood effectively. As a result, waste products such as urea, creatinine, and excess electrolytes may accumulate in the blood, leading to a toxic condition called uremia. 2. Proteinuria: Damage to the glomerular filtration barrier may result in an abnormal leakage of proteins, like albumin, into the urine. This condition, known as proteinuria, not only leads to a loss of essential proteins but also disturbs the overall oncotic pressure and fluid balance within the body. In severe cases, it could lead to nephrotic syndrome, which presents with edema, hyperlipidemia, and hypoalbuminemia. 3. Impaired water and electrolyte balance: Damage to the renal tubules impairs their ability to reabsorb water, sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes, which can lead to an altered fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances. This might cause dehydration or overhydration, as well as abnormal serum electrolyte levels, including hyponatremia (low sodium), hyperkalemia (high potassium), and metabolic acidosis (high acid content), among others. 4. Impaired hormonal regulation of blood pressure: Kidney damage can also impair the secretion of hormones such as renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone, which play crucial roles in blood pressure regulation. This can result in the development of hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In conclusion, any damage to the kidney, whether it affects the glomerulus, renal tubules, or both, can directly impact the blood filtration process and have significant adverse effects on the overall health and functioning of the body. Effective diagnosis, intervention, and management of kidney disease are crucial to minimize these detrimental consequences and maintain optimal organ function."},{"instruction":"Darkness has a negative impact on photosynthesis, and for example, the sun releases energy needed to drive photosynthesis.

In an absolutely scathing review at the Guardian, Peter Bradshaw calls the biopic \\"a breathtaking catastrophe ... a film so awe-inspiringly wooden that it is basically a fire-risk,\\" comparing it to \\"a 104-minute Chanel ad, only without the subtlety and depth.\\" A separate Guardian article rounds up similarly awful reviews and wonders, \\"Is there a critic who liked it?\\" Fox News' amusing headline take: \\"Grace of Monaco called a great comedy, which is bad, because it's a drama.\\" (And yes, the article notes, there were \\"many audible laughs\\" during the screening.) The Los Angeles Times notes that the premiere itself was \\"awkward,\\" thanks to a disagreement between the French filmmakers and the Weinstein Co., which is distributing the film in the US. Harvey Weinstein doesn't like the French cut of the movie, which is what screened at Cannes, and he wasn't even in attendance. The audience seemed to agree with him, the Times notes: \\"Cannes opening-night films tend to generate standing ovations of at least five or six minutes, but the clapping after this one was mostly polite, and it was over after a brief two.\\" Also adding to the drama: Princess Grace's children have called the movie a \\"farce,\\" USA Today notes. But Kidman is standing behind the film, telling the BBC she doesn't regret the role. Expand this summary.","output":"The premiere of 'Grace of Monaco,' starring Nicole Kidman as the late Princess Grace, received an overwhelmingly negative reception at its Cannes Film Festival debut. Renowned critics, such as Peter Bradshaw from the Guardian, referred to the biopic as \\"a breathtaking catastrophe,\\" comparing it to an elongated high-fashion advertisement without the intended impact. Other media outlets echoed similar sentiments, with Fox News reporting that although the film was a drama, it was ironically found to be a great comedy. Adding to the tense atmosphere, the Los Angeles Times highlighted that the film's premiere was \\"awkward\\" due to the ongoing disagreement between the French filmmakers and the Weinstein Co., which is responsible for the film's US distribution. The version screened at Cannes was the French cut, which Harvey Weinstein allegedly disapproved of, leading to his noticeable absence from the event. Moreover, the audience's reaction appears to have aligned with Weinstein's opinion, as the film received only polite applause following the screening – a far cry from the usual five to six-minute standing ovations Cannes opening-night films receive. Unsurprisingly, this short-lived applause concluded within a mere two minutes. Further complicating matters, the children of Princess Grace have publicly denounced the film as a \\"farce,\\" intensifying the overall negativity surrounding the biopic. However, Nicole Kidman remains supportive of her role and the film, stating that she has no regrets for taking part in the project. Ultimately, the future of 'Grace of Monaco' remains uncertain, as negative critical reception and behind-the-scenes tensions cast doubt on the film's potential success. Despite Kidman's unwavering support for the movie, it appears that criticisms and challenges continue to overshadow the once highly-anticipated biopic."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot (Corin Redgrave), while Croft discusses the end of the Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain foppish baronet, is faced with financial ruin unless he retrenches. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood), and Sir Walter's second eldest daughter, the intelligent Anne (Amanda Root). Anne is visibly upset upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth (CiarÃ¡n Hinds)âa naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections.

A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church or temple, and may also serve as an oratory. - Prior, derived from the Latin for \\"earlier, first\\", (or prioress for nuns) is an ecclesiastical title for a superior, usually lower in rank than an abbot or abbess. Its earlier generic usage referred to any monastic superior. - Lanfranc ( Latin : Lanfrancus ; 1005 x 1010 at Pavia -- 24 May 1089 at Canterbury ) was a celebrated Italian jurist who renounced his career to become a Benedictine monk at Bec in Normandy . He served successively as prior of Bec Abbey and abbot of St Stephen in Normandy and then as archbishop of Canterbury in England , following its Conquest by William the Bastard . He is also variously known as Lanfranc of Pavia ( Italian : Lanfranco di Pavia ) , Lanfranc of Bec ( French : Lanfranc du Bec ) , and Lanfranc of Canterbury ( Latin : Lanfrancus Cantuariensis ) . - A title is a prefix or suffix added to someone's name in certain contexts. It may signify either veneration, an official position or a professional or academic qualification. In some languages, titles may be inserted before a last name (for example, \\"Graf\\" in German, Cardinal in Catholic usage or clerical titles such as Archbishop). Some titles are hereditary. - Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity. The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery.

To provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, it is necessary to look into the historical context of the events that unfolded. After the death of Alexander the Great, his vast empire was divided among his former generals, who were collectively known as Diadochi. These generals and their territories faced numerous conflicts and power struggles in the ensuing years, in their attempts to secure control and expand their realms. In the given sentence, an unspecified member of the Diadochi engaged in his own power play by appointing and removing satraps (provincial governors) as though he were the king himself. This act highlights the individual's ambitions and goals of consolidating power and authority. In addition to manipulating the governance of the territories under his control, he also sought to increase his wealth and fund his military campaigns by raiding the royal treasuries of Ectabana, Persepolis, and Susa. These ancient cities were significant political and economic centers during the reign of Alexander the Great and his successors, and their treasuries would, undoubtedly, house immense wealth. By stealing 25,000 talents from these treasuries, the unnamed Diadochi member effectively gained a substantial sum that could be used to bolster his position and execute his objectives. In the silver coinage system prevalent in the Hellenistic period, one talent typically weighed around 26 kilograms (57 pounds). Therefore, the total stolen sum of 25,000 talents would be equivalent to around 650,000 kilograms (approximately 1,433,000 pounds) of silver. This immense fortune would certainly strengthen his standing and provide the necessary resources to pursue his ambitions. To summarize, the sentence in question does present the correct answer to the query about the number of talents stolen from the royal treasuries in Ectabana, Persepolis, and Susa by an unspecified member of the Diadochi. The actions of this individual, which included appointing and removing satraps and raiding the treasuries, were aimed at consolidating power and wealth to advance his position among the rival factions in the ensuing struggles and conflicts that marked the time period after Alexander the Great's death."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given the following context: County Cork, Ireland, 1920.

Today, we are going to learn about how to take care of a new piercing. A piercing is when someone puts a small hole in a part of your body, like your ear or your nose, and puts some special jewelry there. It may sound a bit weird, but lots of people have piercings, and they look really cool! When you get a new piercing, it's very important to take care of it so it can heal properly. Here's how you can do that: 1. Keep from touching your piercing: It's really exciting to have new jewelry, but it's super important not to touch it too much. Our hands can have germs, and we don't want those germs to get on our piercing. So, try to keep your hands away from it as much as you can. 2. Leave the jewelry in place: The jewelry that's put in your new piercing is there to help it heal. If you take it out, it might be hard to put it back in, or your piercing might close up. So, keep the jewelry in until it's all healed, and if you want to change it, ask a grown-up for help. 3. Avoid applying ointments: Sometimes, people want to put ointments or creams on their piercings to make them feel better. But, these can actually cause problems and slow down the healing process. It's best to just let your piercing be and let your body do its healing magic. 4. Wear loose clothing: If your new piercing is on a part of your body that has to touch your clothes, like your belly button, it's important to wear loose clothing. This way, your clothes won't rub against your piercing and cause it to get irritated. 5. Stay away from unclean water: Fun times in the swimming pool or at the beach are great, but not when you have a new piercing. Unclean water can have lots of yucky germs that can make your piercing very unhappy. Until your piercing is healed, stick to playing in clean water, like in a bathtub. 6. Sleep on your back or sides: Getting a good night's sleep is important for healing your new piercing. If you have a piercing on your ear, try to sleep on your back or on the side that doesn't have the piercing. This will help keep your piercing safe and comfy while you catch some Zzz's. There you have it, little friends! Taking care of a new piercing might seem like a big job, but if you follow these steps, it will heal up nicely and look awesome! Just remember to always ask a grown-up for help if you're not sure what to do.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose force is imposed on the rocks more often happens, how will it affect MORE minerals forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation--in this case, the increased imposition of force on rocks--can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of mineral formation. The discussion requires an understanding of the basic geological processes of mineral formation, which are indeed affected by the pressure exerted on the rocks. First, let's overview the processes you've mentioned. 1. Magma cools inside the crust: Minerals can form deep within the Earth's crust where temperatures and pressures are high. This process produces igneous rocks, such as granite and basalt, which contain various minerals. When magma cools slowly underground, the crystals have a longer time to grow and become larger. 2. Magma crystallizes: As the magma slowly cools, elements within it begin to chemically combine, forming minerals. The rate of crystallization and the specific minerals formed are determined by the chemical composition of the magma, temperature, and pressure. 3. Lava cools on the surface: Lava, or magma that has reached the surface of the Earth, cools much faster than magma underground, giving the minerals less time to crystallize. This results in smaller crystals and the formation of extrusive igneous rocks, like basalt and obsidian. 4. Lava crystallizes: As the lava cools, its elements chemically coalesce into minerals, creating a rock with tiny crystals. 5. Minerals dissolve in water and crystallize: This forms sedimentary rock. When water evaporates or changing conditions cause mineral-saturated water to become supersaturated, mineral crystals can precipitate. Now, let's explore how increased imposition of force can impact these processes. Direct Effect: The direct effect refers to the literal change in the physical environment in which the rocks are situated. Greater force can translate into increased pressure. When we discuss an increased imposition of force, we're intrinsically discussing an increased pressure system that would, in turn, influence the rate and type of mineral formation. Minerals forming deep within Earth’s crust under high pressure would respond differently to this change than those subjected to low pressures at or near the Earth's surface. Higher pressures generally lead to minerals with more compact structures. This can influence some transitions from one mineral type to another. For example, graphite under very high pressure can transform into diamond. Indirect Effect: Indirect effects could be seen as changes in geochemical cycles or shifts in further physical or chemical conditions due to the increased force. Increased pressures can indirectly affect the nature and degree of metamorphism occurring in metamorphic rocks, as the minerals within the rocks react to the changes in pressure and temperature. Changes in pressure can also alter the solubility of water in magma, possibly causing it to crystallize more quickly and alter the types of minerals that form. Therefore, more frequent applications of force on rocks will cause the physical conditions of mineral formation to change, leading to potential differences in the types and qualities of the minerals formed."},{"instruction":"whether it is horse gear or women’s accessories, they know how to give the world something new that it needs. hermes was the first label to get exclusive rights to use the zipper for leather as well as clothing.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What does Ripley forge in Dickie's name? Movie plot title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has...

Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children. Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as \\"murder simulators\\" to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, \\"In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers.\\" Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, \\"If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.\\" Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as \\"Pearl Harbor 2\\". According to Thompson, \\"Many parents think that stores won't sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.\\" Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \\"Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They're not even speech. They're dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,\\" as well as simply calling video games \\"mental masturbation\\". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \\"for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end\\". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller \\"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory.\\" Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the \\"functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,\\" and \\"the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense\\". Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"One interesting aspect from the article is Thompson's perspective on the connection between video games and the military. He states that part of the impetus for violent games comes from the military, which is looking for \\"a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end.\\" Furthermore, Thompson claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, illustrating the potential influence of such technologies on game development."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Context: Aldosterone blockade has followed in the footsteps of ACE inhibition in reducing mortality in patients with heart failure. This is associated with its beneficial effects on endothelial function and heart rate variability. Diabetes is another area, where angiotensin II withdrawal has proven to be of particular value. We postulated that aldosterone blockade with spironolactone might also have beneficial effects on the prognostic markers of endothelial function and heart rate variability in diabetic patients.', 'We assessed endothelial function by forearm venous occlusion plethysmography in 42 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after 1 month of treatment with spironolactone or placebo allocated in a randomised double-blind trial. Of the 42 patients, 20 were on ACE inhibitor therapy. We also assessed heart rate variability, HbA1c and plasma angiotensin II levels at the end of each treatment period.', 'Compared to placebo, spironolactone decreased forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine by 44.56+/-14.56% (p=0.003) in the group as a whole and by 57.61+/-15.56% (p<0.001) in the 20 patients on ACE inhibition. Spironolactone also worsened heart rate variability parameters, with root mean squared standard deviation decreased by 1.99+/-0.93 ms (p=0.03), low-frequency normalised power increased by 2.00+/-0.91 normalised units (nu) (p=0.03), high-frequency normalised power decreased by 1.98+/-0.94 nu (p=0.04) and the low frequency : high frequency ratio increased by 0.40+/-0.19 (p=0.04). HbA1c and angiotensin II increased during treatment with spironolactone by 0.26+/-0.07% (p=0.001) and 8.12+/-1.94 pg/ml (p=0.001) respectively.Question: Does spironolactone impair endothelial function and heart rate variability in patients with type 2 diabetes?","output":"Part #1: Generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Usage: Yes, spironolactone impairs endothelial function and heart rate variability in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is based on the context, which states that forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine decreased and heart rate variability parameters worsened with spironolactone treatment. This meets the criteria because the information is directly drawn from the context and is used to answer the question. Part #2: Identify the question. Usage: Does spironolactone impair endothelial function and heart rate variability in patients with type 2 diabetes? This meets the criteria because it is the question asked in the task. Part #3: Find relevant information in the context. Usage: Relevant information includes the fact that spironolactone decreased forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine and worsened heart rate variability parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. This meets the criteria because it directly answers the question. Part #4: Provide statistics or evidence from the context. Usage: The context states that compared to placebo, spironolactone decreased forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine by 44.56+/-14.56% (p=0.003) and worsened heart rate variability parameters, with root mean squared standard deviation decreased by 1.99+/-0.93 ms (p=0.03), among other changes.
