The answer is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: \\"An unstable isotope is produced.\\" Justification of steps: 1. An unstable isotope is produced: To begin the process, there must be the creation or formation of an unstable isotope. This could happen through various processes, such as nuclear reactions or cosmic ray exposure. 2. The isotope is unstable: The isotope in question is not stable and has a tendency to change its form to reach a more stable state. Its instability is the driving force behind the next steps in the process. 3. The isotope emits radiation: As a consequence of being unstable, the isotope releases energy in the form of radiation. This emission is the process through which the isotope begins to decay and transform. 4. The isotope decays: Decay is the process by which an unstable nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. It is a natural occurrence in various isotopes trying to achieve a more stable state. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: During the decay process, isotopes often lose atomic particles, such as protons, neutrons, or electrons. This loss impacts the composition of the isotope, ultimately leading to a change in its atomic structure. 6. The isotope turns into a different element: As a result of the changes in atomic structure, the isotope transforms into a new element with different properties. This is due to the loss or gain of protons, which define the element. 7. The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation: The process comes to an end when the isotope has reached a stable state. At this point, it no longer emits radiation or goes through decay, meaning its transformation is complete."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: For most of the 20th century, Asia asked itself what it could learn from the modern, innovating West. Now the question must be reversed. What can the West's overly indebted and sluggish nations learn from a flourishing Asia? Just a few decades ago, Asia's two giants were stagnating under faulty economic ideologies. However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction. As the Indian economist Amartya Sen has wisely said, \\"The invisible hand of the market has often relied heavily on the visible hand of government.\\" Contrast this middle path with America and Europe, which have each gone ideologically over-board in their own ways. Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government---following Ronald Regan's idea that \\"government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. \\"Of course, when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day. Despite this fact, many Americans are still strongly opposed to \\"big government.\\" If Americans could only free themselves from their antigovernment doctrine(,), they would begin to see that the America's problems are not insoluble. A few sensible federal measures could put the country back on the right path. A simple consumption tax of, say, 5% would significantly reduce the country's huge government deficit without damaging productivity. A small gasoline tax would help free America from its dependence on oil imports and create motivations for green energy development. In the same way, a significant reduction of wasteful agricultural subsidies could also lower the deficit. But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less...

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering the internal angles of a polygon, it's important to recall the formula for finding the total degrees of those angles. The formula is (n-2) × 180°, where \\"n\\" represents the number of sides of the polygon. In this case, we're working with a hexagon, which has six sides. Plugging this into the formula, we get (6-2) × 180°. Next, we'll perform the subtraction inside the parentheses: 6 - 2 = 4. Now, the formula reads 4 × 180°. Finally, we can determine the total degrees in the internal angles of the hexagon by multiplying 4 by 180°: 4 × 180° = 720°. However, since the answer required is 180, this outcome doesn't align with the given answer. It could be that the question refers to the sum of three consecutive interior angles of a regular hexagon, as each angle would measure 120°. Hence, in the case of a regular hexagon, if we consider three consecutive interior angles and sum them up, we will get 120° + 120° + 120° = 360°. Out of these angles, one of the angles could be an exterior angle which is the supplementary angle of the interior angle. So, the exterior angle would be 180° - 120° = 60°. Now, if we replace one interior angle with its exterior angle, the sum would be 120° + 120° + 60° = 300°. Then, if we take this sum and subtract a straight angle (180°) to obtain the difference between two supplementary angles, we would get the answer as 300° - 180° = 180. So the question could be, \\"What is the difference between the sum of three consecutive interior angles and the sum of two interior angles and one exterior angle of a regular hexagon?\\" And the answer would be 180."},{"instruction":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Let's analyze each method in detail to help you decide which one makes more sense in your situation. Option 1: Stovetop Method Using a stovetop for boiling water in a saucepan is the most conventional and widely-used approach. The stovetop method is reliable and efficient, as it directly heats the saucepan at a consistent temperature, enabling the water to boil within a short amount of time. Here are the steps involved: 1. Choose a suitable saucepan: Ensure that the saucepan's material is ideal for stovetop use and is capable of handling high heat, such as stainless steel, aluminum, or cast iron. 2. Fill the saucepan: Pour the required amount of water into the saucepan, taking care not to fill it to the brim as boiling water may overflow. Generally, filling it about halfway is ideal. 3. Place the saucepan on the stovetop: Set the saucepan on an appropriate burner and ensure the handle doesn't extend beyond the edge of the stove. 4. Turn on the heat: Adjust the burner to a medium-high setting, which is typically ideal for boiling water quickly. 5. Monitor the progress: Keep an eye on the water, and wait for it to reach a full rolling boil, which is when large bubbles rise to the surface continually. 6. Turn off the heat: As soon as the water reaches a boil, turn off the stove and proceed with your intended use of the boiling water. Option 2: Electric Kettle or Induction Heater Method This method involves using an electric kettle or an induction heater to boil water before transferring it to a saucepan. This might be useful for those without a direct heat source or those who want to speed up the process by using an appliance specifically designed for boiling water. Here are the steps: 1. Choose the right appliance: Invest in a high-quality electric kettle or induction heater that suits your needs. 2. Fill the appliance: Pour the required amount of water into the electric kettle or induction-compatible pot, again taking care not to overfill. 3. Turn on the appliance: Plug in the kettle or induction heater, switch it on, and set the desired temperature. 4. Monitor the progress: Wait for the water to come to a full rolling boil, indicated by large, rolling bubbles or by the appliance automatically switching off. 5. Carefully transfer the boiling water: Turn off the appliance, and using heat-resistant gloves or a towel, slowly pour the boiling water into the saucepan. Be sure to do this in a stable environment and away from any children or pets. Both methods successfully accomplish the goal, but their suitability depends on the resources you have available and your personal preferences. If you have a stovetop or cooktop, option 1 is the most straightforward and efficient method. It provides direct heat to the saucepan, ensuring quick boiling and easy temperature control. In addition, stovetops are versatile, allowing you to boil various amounts of water and use the heat source for other cooking purposes simultaneously. Alternatively, option 2 can be a reliable choice for those without access to a stovetop or if you prefer using energy-efficient and quick-heating appliances. Electric kettles, for instance, are designed specifically for boiling water and can do so rapidly due to their enclosed heating mechanism. However, it may require extra care and attention when transferring the boiling water, as it increases the risk of spills or accidents. In conclusion, both methods are effective in achieving the goal of boiling water in a saucepan, and the most suitable one for you will depend on your resources, requirements, and preferences."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence based on \\"u.s. agency accuses bloomberg lp of discrimination against women who took maternity leave\\"","output":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the given phrase - U.S. agency, Bloomberg LP, discrimination, women, maternity leave Step 2: Choose the subject and the verb for the sentence - Subject: U.S. agency - Verb: accuses Step 3: Add the object and provide specifics or details related to the subject and verb - Object: Bloomberg LP - Details: discrimination against women who took maternity leave Step 4: Construct a sentence using the chosen subject, verb, object, and details - \\"The U.S. agency accuses Bloomberg LP of discriminating against women who took maternity leave.\\" Step 5: Ensure the sentence is grammatically correct and conveys the meaning of the given phrase The final sentence is \\"The U.S. agency accuses Bloomberg LP of discriminating against women who took maternity leave.\\" This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys the meaning of the given phrase accurately."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Clean your brooms every three months. Article:","output":"Title: Maintaining Your Trusty Cleaning Ally: Broom Hygiene 101 Introduction The broom is a familiar fixture in every household, diligently sweeping away dirt, dust, and grime. We often take this integral part of our cleaning regimen for granted, but like every other tool or appliance, brooms need proper maintenance to function optimally over the long haul. In this article, we focus on one crucial aspect of broom maintenance - the cleaning schedule, aiming to shed light on the relevance of regularly cleaning your broom every three months. Frequency and Importance of Cleaning a Broom Determining how often a broom should be cleaned involves a host of considerations like usage, type of debris it gathers, and the cleaning environment. However, as a general rule of thumb, cleaning your broom every three months is a prudent practice to follow. The rationale behind this timeline is straightforward. By cleaning your broom quarterly, you can ensure that it remains effective at its primary task - cleaning. Over time, brooms tend to accumulate dirt, hair, and other residues which can get trapped among the bristles. This accumulation not only hampers the broom's overall efficiency but can become a breeding ground for bacteria, leading to hygiene concerns. Therefore, a three-month cleaning cycle is just right to prevent these issues and prolong the broom's lifespan. The Cleaning Process Properly cleaning a broom is a straightforward but important process. First, use your hands or a comb to manually remove any large debris entwined around the bristles. Then, prepare a cleaning solution of warm water and mild detergent in a basin. Soak the broom head in this solution for about an hour to loosen any stubborn dirt or residue. Following the soak, scrub the broom bristles gently using a scrubbing brush. After scrubbing, rinse it under warm running water until no soap suds or visible dirt remain. Shake off the excess water, and let the broom dry naturally, preferably outdoors. In case of brooms used for wet jobs or in damp environs, occasional disinfection using a mild bleach solution can be added to the regimen to kill any potentially lurking bacteria or molds. Conclusion They say cleanliness is next to godliness, and your cleaning tools, including brooms, embody that principle. By Cleaning your broom every three months, you're not only ensuring the continued cleanliness of your surroundings but also prudently safeguarding your health from potential bacterial contamination. Therefore, the next time you’re sweeping away, remember your broom needs its share of care too. Even a modest cleaning routine can work wonders in maintaining your broom’s functionality and prolonging its service life. Keeping in mind the frequency of cleaning and the basic process, you can ensure that your trusty broom continues to serve you efficiently, making your cleaning chores less daunting.

Not a good idea, according to Derek DeGrazio, celeb trainer at Barry’s Bootcamp Miami Beach. “Something is better than nothing,” says DeGrazio, who trains celebs like Adriana Lima, Nina Agdal and Ellie Goulding when they’re in town. “We all have holiday parties to attend, but we also have 24 hours in a day.” Below, his five can’t-miss moves for the holiday season. “Mix in a 10-minute run, walk, bike, hop, skip — anything that gets you moving and breaks a little sweat! If it’s cold and your driveway is covered in snow, put an extra layer on and grab a shovel.” Now pass the peppermint bark. Reverse Lunges with a Squat: “These will slim down and tone your butt and legs while burning extra calories. Because you’re stepping backwards with reverse lunges, your core engages more for stability, offering an extra abs workout without doing one sit-up. To look extra hot this holiday season, top off each leg lunge with a squat.” Plank/Push: Planks and Push-Ups. “Two must-do exercises rolled into one. Planks tighten that belly, while the push-up tones up those arms. It’s my holiday gift to you: one exercise with twice the results.” Hollow Rock: “Don’t be fooled — it’s not as easy as it looks! But it sure is worth the (good) pain. Rock your body all the way to that v-shaped back and torso. The more you rock, the better you look. The better you look, the better you feel. So rock on!” Side Plank Reach: “A great twist on your traditional side plank. That small reach-through to the opposite hip packs a big punch to help get rid of your gut. Make sure to exhale when you reach through and suck that belly in to maximize the results.” Leg Raises: “One of the first places we store fat is the lower belly. One of the last places it comes off is the lower belly. (Sorry — life is unfair sometimes!) Throw leg raises into your routine to help get rid of that pooch. And maybe skip the second piece of pie.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"In this article, celebrity trainer Derek DeGrazio shares five effective workout moves to stay in shape during the holiday season. These exercises, practiced by stars like Adriana Lima, Ellie Goulding, and Nina Agdal, include reverse lunges with a squat, plank/push, hollow rock, side plank reach, and leg raises. DeGrazio suggests incorporating these moves with a 10-minute cardio activity, such as running or walking, and emphasizes that some exercise is better than none during the holiday season."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: The third matter we agreed on is to find out if there could be any health risks for those who pass through this machine to board commercial flights.

Article: An American educational expert, Frederick M. Hess, says that a long summer vacation doesn't make sense in today's world. This summer, 50 million kids will spend much time talking online, watching TV, playing video games and asking older brothers or sisters to take them to the supermarket. They will also be putting their academic futures at risk. During much of the 20th century, many Americans worked in factories that did not need a college degree but still offered a high salary. Also, in the 19th century, there was no air condition. And poor hygiene meant that crowded schools had health risks. Things have changed. For today's students, academic skills are key to future success. Many countries don't give kids an American-style summer vacation. They offer no more than seven consecutive weeks of vacation. Most American school districts offer up to 13 weeks. To compete in global marketplace, Americans must be prepared to go up against international competitors. Summer vacation also causes challenges for today's families. In the 1960s, more than 60% of families had a stay-at-home mum. Now, two-thirds of American children live families where every adult works. For these families, summer vacation can be more burden than break. Someone must watch the kids. But the biggest problem may be how summer vacation hurts academic achievement. Scientist have found that disadvantaged students lose important ground in the summertime. A school year can allow time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons. Schools would have more time for sports, languages, music and the arts.

Question 2: Do apps like Clean Master actually boost your phone's performance by analysing the CPU temperature and other things? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answer to Question 1: Do apps like Clean Master really work? Yes, apps like Clean Master do work in the sense that they perform the tasks they claim to do, such as freeing up storage space on your phone, deleting junk files, organizing apps, and managing background processes. However, the effectiveness of some of the features, especially those related to improving the device's performance, is often debated. Clean Master and similar apps work by locating and deleting unnecessary files such as cache files, residual files from uninstalled apps, and advert files. These actions can help to improve storage space and address minor issues with your device. Additionally, these apps may even include features like an antivirus, an app locker, and a notification cleaner, which can be helpful in providing basic security and maintaining user privacy on the device. Answer to Question 2: Do apps like Clean Master actually boost your phone's performance by analyzing the CPU temperature and other things? The claim that Clean Master and similar apps can significantly boost your phone's performance by analyzing the CPU temperature and using other optimization techniques has been the subject of much debate. These apps generally work on the premise that by freeing up memory (RAM) and managing background processes, they can enhance the overall performance of the device. However, the benefits of these performance enhancements are often not as noticeable as the apps claim. In reality, today's smartphones are designed to manage resources efficiently, and their operating systems already work to optimize memory and CPU usage. Most of the time, features such as background app management and RAM clearing that Clean Master employs might not have a considerable impact on the device's overall performance. Additionally, there have been reports that apps like Clean Master often include advertisements and may potentially compromise user privacy and security. As a result, some experts argue that their drawbacks may outweigh their benefits. In conclusion, although the answers to both questions are not exactly the same, they are related. Apps like Clean Master do work and perform the tasks they claim to do; however, when it comes to boosting the phone's performance, the effectiveness of these apps is often debated. It is essential to understand the limitations of these apps and use them responsibly while considering built-in tools provided by the device manufacturers and operating system for better optimization solutions."},{"instruction":"- Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere What might be the last step of the process?","output":"- As a result of the trapped heat, global temperatures rise, leading to climate change and various consequences such as extreme weather events, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems and human societies."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

(IV) heat.","output":"The form of energy stored in a battery is (I) chemical energy. Allow me to provide you with a detailed explanation regarding batteries and how they store energy. Batteries are essentially electrochemical devices that store and release energy through chemical reactions. These chemical reactions occur between the battery's internal components, such as the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. When a battery is connected to an electrical circuit, a chemical reaction occurs within the battery that generates electrical energy, which then flows through the circuit, powering various electronic devices. A battery consists of one or more cells, each containing a positive terminal (or the cathode) and a negative terminal (or the anode). The cathode is an electrode material that releases positively charged ions (cations) during discharging, while the anode is another electrode material that accepts these cations while releasing negatively charged ions (anions) and electrons. The electrolyte is a conductive material (either liquid or solid) present between the anode and the cathode that allows only the passage of ions, not electrons. When a battery is connected to an external circuit, the chemical reaction between the anode and the electrolyte causes the anode to release electrons. These electrons cannot pass through the electrolyte, so they flow through the external circuit. Concurrently, cations from the anode move through the electrolyte toward the cathode, while anions from the cathode move through the electrolyte toward the anode, maintaining the electrical neutrality of the electrolyte. As the chemical reaction progresses, the anode releases its reactant into the electrolyte, transferring electrons to the external circuit and providing a flow of electric current to power electronic devices. The flow of electrons continues as long as the battery has remaining chemical energy, and this flow ultimately stops when the anode or the cathode has depleted its supply of reactants. It is important to note the distinction between the other forms of energy listed in the question and the energy stored in a battery. Sound energy is a form of mechanical energy produced by the vibration of particles in a medium such as air, water, or solids. Light energy, or electromagnetic radiation, is emitted from sources such as the sun, light bulbs, and fire. Heat energy, or thermal energy, is the internal kinetic energy of moving particles within a substance due to temperature differences. In contrast, a battery specifically stores chemical energy that is converted into electrical energy when utilized. In conclusion, the energy stored in a battery is chemical energy, derived from the chemical reactions of the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. This energy is then converted into electrical energy when the battery is connected to an external circuit, powering electronic devices and appliances."},{"instruction":"Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"You can wear a bikini on the beach\\" - Sentence B: \\"You should wear a bikini in the cinema\\" Hmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.","output":"Of the two sentences provided, Sentence B doesn't make sense. Here's the reasoning: Sentence A: \\"You can wear a bikini on the beach\\" This sentence makes sense because a bikini is a type of swimwear, which is appropriate attire for the beach. Beaches are typically associated with sunbathing, swimming, and other water-related activities, so wearing a bikini at the beach is both logical and socially acceptable. Sentence B: \\"You should wear a bikini in the cinema\\" This sentence doesn't make sense because a bikini is not appropriate attire for a cinema. Cinemas are indoor establishments where people watch movies, and the dress code is generally casual or semi-casual clothing, such as jeans, dresses, or trousers. Wearing a bikini in a cinema would likely be both uncomfortable and socially unacceptable, as it deviates from the standard dress code expectations for that environment."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Abilene, Texas, isPartOf, Texas; United States, capital, Washington, D.C.; Texas, country, United States; United States, largestCity, New York City; Texas, language, English language.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Canadian Idol was a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show \\"Pop Idol\\". The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the \\"roving reporter\\" for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six. - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Tyler Hamilton is a pop singer best known for placing seventh in the first season of Canadian Idol . He is also a member of the classical music group \`\` Due Voci . '' The group has recently released their first studio album in June 2010 . - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

Scott abandons his family, driving to Florida in his shiny red 1959 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Racer to find himself. When Scott stops for gas and refreshments, he encounters Tom Wilson (Hutchins), who is on his way to take a job as a waterskiing instructor at a Miami hotel. Scott and Tom make small talk, and a chance remark by Tom gives Scott an idea: He switches identities with Tom so he can find out how people react to him as an ordinary person rather than a millionaire. Tom has fun staying at the same hotel and pretending he is rich. Shortly after, hotel guest Dianne Carter (Fabares) insists on taking a lesson minutes after Scott checks in with his new \\"employer\\". However, once they are out on the water, Dianne proves herself to be an expert skier, performing fancy maneuvers to gain the attention of wealthy young playboy James J. Jamison III (Bixby). Later, Dianne confesses to Scott that she is a gold digger, assuming that he is one too. Scott agrees to help Dianne land Jamison, but ends up falling for her himself. Scott persuades boat builder Sam Burton (Merrill) to allow him to rebuild the Rawhide, a damaged high-performance boat, and drive it in the annual Orange Bowl Race, which Jamison has won the last three years. Scott sends for some \\"goop\\", an experimental coating his father spent a lot of money trying (and failing) to perfect. Between his day job and moonlighting as a chemist, Scott is run ragged, but he manages to (hopefully) fix goop's major flaw: losing its strength in water. With no time for testing before the race, he applies it to the boat's hull and prays it will hold the Rawhide together.[2][3] Duster learns where his son is and comes to see what he is doing. To Scott's surprise, his father is enormously proud of what he has accomplished. Meanwhile, Jamison proposes to Dianne. Scott barges into the suite before she can give Jamison an answer, but the...

Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated. and a hint : Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] Please answer this question : Which of the two areas had more phytoplankton? A:","output":"Area B, situated 35 miles south of the mouth of the Danube River, likely had more phytoplankton than Area A. This conclusion can be reached by considering the differences in the water conditions between the two areas and their impact on phytoplankton growth. In Area A, water stratification is high due to the fresh water discharged by the Danube River. This stratification results in the formation of distinct layers with different properties such as salinity, oxygenation, density, and temperature. These layers act as barriers to the mixing of water, which can lead to anoxia or euxinia. Furthermore, stratification creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. Phytoplankton, as primary producers, require nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus for growth and reproduction. Due to the stratification in Area A, these nutrients that are often found in deeper waters may not be able to reach the photic zone where phytoplankton reside. The photic zone is the upper part of the water column where sunlight penetrates, enabling photosynthesis to occur. Limited nutrient availability in the photic zone will impede the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton, thus reducing primary production and overall phytoplankton biomass in Area A. On the other hand, Area B has less water stratification and is more oxygenated. This allows for better mixing of nutrients throughout the water column, promoting a more favorable environment for phytoplankton growth. More nutrients can reach the photic zone, providing the necessary resources for phytoplankton to thrive and increase primary production. Additionally, higher oxygen levels in Area B support an increased diversity of marine life, including grazers that could help maintain a more balanced ecosystem in which phytoplankton can flourish. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is likely that Area B supported a greater abundance of phytoplankton than Area A due to its less stratified and more oxygenated water conditions that promote nutrient mixing and availability in the photic zone."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Bananaman, creator, Steve Bright.

The rocket's main components are designed by Boeing's Defense, Space & Security division and built in the United Launch Alliance (ULA) facility in Decatur, Alabama. Final assembly is completed at the launch site by ULA. The rockets were designed to launch payloads into orbit for the United States Air Force Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program and commercial satellite business. Delta IV rockets are available in five versions: Medium, Medium+ (4,2), Medium+ (5,2), Medium+ (5,4), and Heavy, to cover a range of payload size and weight. Delta IV was primarily designed to satisfy the needs of the U.S. military. - A Launch service provider (LSP) is a type of company which specialises in launching spacecraft. It is responsible for the ordering, conversion, or construction of the carrier rocket, assembly and stacking, payload integration, and ultimately conducting the launch itself. Some of these tasks may be delegated or sub-contracted to other companies. For example, the United Launch Alliance subcontracts the production of GEM solid rocket motors for its Atlas V, Delta II and Delta IV rockets to Alliant Techsystems. An LSP does not necessarily build all the rockets it launches. - A rocket (from Italian \\"rocchetto\\" \\"bobbin\\") is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space. - A geosynchronous transfer orbit or geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) is a Hohmann transfer orbit used to reach geosynchronous or geostationary orbit using high thrust chemical engines. It is a highly elliptical Earth orbit with an apogee of , or above sea level, which corresponds to the geostationary (GEO) altitude. The period of a standard geosynchronous transfer orbit is about 10.5 hours. The argument of perigee is such that apogee occurs on or near the equator. Perigee can be anywhere above the atmosphere, but is usually restricted to a few hundred kilometers above the Earth's surface to reduce launcher delta-V (formula_1V) requirements and to limit the orbital lifetime of the spent booster so as to curtail space junk. If using low-thrust engines such as electrical propulsion to get from the transfer orbit to geostationary orbit, the transfer orbit can be supersynchronous (having an apogee above the final geosynchronous orbit). This method however takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit. The typical launch vehicle injects the satellite to a supersynchronous orbit having the apogee above 42,164 km. The satellite's low thrust engines are thrusted continuously around the geostationary transfer orbits in an inertial direction. This inertial direction is set to be in the velocity vector at apogee but with an outer plane direction. The outer plane direction removes the initial inclination set by the initial transfer orbit while the inner plane direction raises simultaneously the perigee and lowers the apogee of the intermediate geostationary transfer orbit. In case of using the Hohmann transfer orbit, only a few days are required to reach the geosynchronous orbit. By using low thrust engines or electrical propulsion, months are required until the satellite reaches its final orbit. - Delta II is an American space launch system, originally designed and built by McDonnell Douglas. Delta II is part of the Delta rocket family and entered service in 1989. Delta II vehicles included the Delta 6000, and two Delta 7000 variants (\\"Light\\" and \\"Heavy\\"). - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK) was an American aerospace, defense, and sporting goods company with its headquarters in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States. The company operated in 22 states, Puerto Rico, and other countries. ATK's revenue in the 2014 fiscal year was about US4.78 billion. - Atlas V is an active expendable launch system in the Atlas rocket family. Atlas V was formerly operated by Lockheed Martin, and is now operated by the Lockheed Martin-Boeing joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA). Each Atlas V rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine burning kerosene and liquid oxygen to power its first stage and an American-built RL10 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to power its Centaur upper stage. The RD-180 engines are provided by RD Amross, while Aerojet Rocketdyne provides both the RL10 engines and the strap-on boosters used in some configurations. The standard payload fairing sizes are 4 or 5 meters in diameter and of various lengths. Fairings sizes as large as 7.2 m in diameter and up to 32.3 m in length have been considered. The rocket is assembled in Decatur, Alabama and Harlingen, Texas. - Arianespace SA is a French multinational company founded in 1980 as the world 's first commercial launch service provider . It undertakes the production , operation , and marketing of the Ariane programme . The main launch vehicles offered by the company are the Ariane 5 , the Soyuz - 2 as a medium - lift alternative , and the Vega as a lighter one . As of 2008 , more than 240 commercial launches have occurred since May 22 , 1984 . Arianespace states that the total number of launch contracts signed since Ariane launches commenced operations in 1984 is 285 . Arianespace uses the Centre Spatial Guyanais in French Guiana as a launch site . It has its headquarters in Courcouronnes , Essonne , France , near Évry . On 21 October 2011 Arianespace launched the first Soyuz rocket ever from outside former Soviet territory . The payload was two Galileo navigation satellites . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An expendable launch system is a launch system that uses an expendable launch vehicle (ELV) to carry a payload into space. The vehicles used in expendable launch systems are designed to be used only once (i.e. they are \\"expended\\" during a single flight), and their components are not recovered for re-use after launch. The vehicle typically consists of several rocket stages, discarded one by one as the vehicle gains altitude and speed. - Ariane 5 is a European heavy lift launch vehicle that is part of the Ariane rocket family, an expendable launch system used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low Earth orbit (LEO). Ariane 5 rockets are manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. Airbus Defence and Space is the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a consortium of sub-contractors. Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by Arianespace as part of the \\"Ariane\\" programme.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: Life is a series of experiences and milestones in the life of a living organism. From birth to growth, development, and the passage of time, many factors contribute to the life cycle of an individual. However, eventually, their time on Earth comes to an end. This process is known as death. The concept of death can lead one to question the purpose of life and the mysteries that lie beyond their final moments. Various factors can contribute to the eventuality of death, such as aging, diseases, accidents, and sometimes even abrupt occurrences. Throughout history, humans have developed an understanding of death as part of nature's cycle. In many cultures, death is seen as a transition to another state of being rather than the final end. Philosophical debates often occur about the nature of death, what comes after it, and whether or not there is an afterlife. Regardless of how one perceives death, it remains an unchanging truth that every living organism will face this final event in their lives. Therefore, with death being universal and inevitable, one can appreciate and value the impermanence of life while seeking answers to its mysteries alike."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given a set of four words, generate the category that the words belong to.

Options are: A). no; B). yes;","output":"To complete the task, I will analyze the three questions provided and determine if they have the same meaning, leading to the correct choice between option A (no) and option B (yes). 1. According to Islam, if Allah created the entire universe, why does He care if a woman shows their hair? This question is concerning the Islamic belief in Allah and the religious practice of modesty for women in Islam, often manifested through wearing a hijab or other head covering. 2. Why don't girls say anything to a boy if he plays with their hair? This question is about social interactions between girls and boys and why girls might not object to a boy touching or playing with their hair. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? To determine if these questions have the same meaning, we should compare their content: Question 1 deals with the Islamic belief system and religious practices related to women's modesty. Question 2 focuses on social interactions between girls and boys, specifically concerning personal boundaries and communication. Based on these comparisons, the two questions do not address the same subject or meaning. Therefore, the correct answer is: A) no"},{"instruction":"\\", clever \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","output":"The sentiment of the sentence containing the single word \\"clever\\" followed by a space may be perceived differently depending on the context it is used in, the tone, the speaker, and the listener's understanding of the term. Let's explore various scenarios that could influence the sentiment associated with the sentence. 1. Positive Sentiment: In general, the word \\"clever\\" refers to intelligence, smartness, or skillfulness. If the speaker is using the term to compliment someone for their wit or creativity, it could be perceived as a positive sentiment, acknowledging the person's abilities or quick thinking. For example, if one solves a puzzle quickly, someone might say, \\", clever \\" as a form of compliment. 2. Neutral Sentiment: In some cases, the term \\"clever\\" might not carry an emotional weight and may only describe a fact or observation. For example, if someone is explaining a particular solution and they mention that it is clever, they might not necessarily be praising it but simply describing an aspect of it. In this case, the sentiment could be perceived as neutral. 3. Negative Sentiment: Sometimes, the term \\"clever\\" could be used sarcastically or to criticize someone's actions or behavior. This might happen when someone thinks the action is deceptive or manipulative. For example, if a person comes up with a plan or idea that is deemed deceitful or cunning, someone might say \\", clever \\" with a tone of disapproval. The sentiment, in this case, would be negative. Another scenario where \\"clever\\" may take on a negative connotation is when a speaker uses it to highlight that an individual's intelligence has been primarily used for personal gain at the expense of others. This type of sentiment often reflects social disapproval and disappointment. 4. Ambiguous Sentiment: Without additional context or information, it could be challenging to determine the sentiment accurately. For example, the sentence \\", clever \\" could be perceived as positive, neutral, or negative based on the context, body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions, none of which are available in a text format. This lack of context and additional cues render the sentiment ambiguous. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\", clever \\" can be positive, neutral, negative, or ambiguous, depending on various contextual factors and the way it is used. It is essential to pay attention to the tone of voice, facial expressions, body language, and surrounding context to better understand and accurately interpret the sentiment associated with the term."},{"instruction":"My wife had a little sample of several things- all were tasty.

Friends and family gathered around the metal statue Tuesday, June 25, at the National Ranching Heritage Center for what they hoped would be an opportunity to find peace and honor Miguel Martinez where he died within minutes of the accident just before 3 a.m. Saturday. “We just need to get together and pray and be supportive,” said Brenda Garcia, a family friend. One of two adults near Martinez in his last minutes said his death was a “pure accident.” Marenda Podhorsky said Tuesday that she and her boyfriend took her four children and Martinez to play in the park area near the center early Saturday morning, according to the Associated Press. Martinez was spending the night with Podhorsky’s son and the children were awake well past midnight after eating sweets to celebrate her boyfriend’s birthday. When she heard a thump, she thought Martinez might have been knocked down by the bull’s horn during a game of hide-and-seek. Instead, Martinez suffered a chest wound. He died after being impaled by the horn. Texas Tech police, who continued investigating the death Tuesday, released a heavily redacted copy of a police report. The redacted report shows only the date, time, location and a brief synopsis. “He was running and ran into the horn of one of the statues,” the report states. “The boy was unresponsive and died because of his injuries.” Garcia said she has known Martinez for years. Her daughter and Martinez were close friends who attended Cavazos Middle School together. She described him as a good role model to their friends. “And he was always into sports,” she said, listing basketball, football and track. “Whatever season the sports were, he was playing.” Garcia said she would not allow her daughter out past midnight, but avoided laying blame for the accident. “Boys are going to be boys and they’re going to be out late,” she said. “This could happen to anybody, day or night.” Stephanie Cole, a store manager at Wells Fargo’s North University Avenue bank branch, said Martinez’s family is accepting donations through the Miguel Martinez Memorial Fund at Wells Fargo.

Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking \\"refuge in the triple gem\\" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.\\" Answer: A:","output":"The Triple Gem, also known as the Three Jewels or Triratna, is the core of the Buddhist faith and consists of three fundamental aspects: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. These elements are central to Buddhist beliefs and practices, and taking refuge in the Triple Gem signifies a person's commitment to following the Buddhist path. Here is a detailed explanation of the three components: 1. The Buddha: This refers to Siddhartha Gautama, who became the historical Buddha, and also to the concept of the Buddha-nature that exists within all sentient beings. Buddha, which means the \\"awakened one\\" or the \\"enlightened one\\", is a person who has reached the state of perfect enlightenment and serves as a guide for others in their quest for spiritual awakening. The Buddha is a role model and a symbol of the potential for liberation that exists within all living beings. By taking refuge in the Buddha, one acknowledges the Buddha's teachings and seeks to follow his example. 2. The Dharma: The Dharma embodies the teachings, the truths, and the path expounded by the Buddha to guide his followers toward spiritual enlightenment. Dharma encompasses the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and various other discourses, parables, and teachings that address different aspects of human existence and spiritual development. By taking refuge in the Dharma, one commits to understanding and putting these teachings into practice, which ultimately leads to the cessation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. 3. The Sangha: The Sangha is the spiritual community of Buddhists who walk the path to enlightenment together. It encompasses both the monastic community (monks and nuns) and the lay community (laypeople who practice Buddhism). The Sangha is important because it provides support, guidance, and inspiration to individuals along the spiritual journey. By taking refuge in the Sangha, one joins a community of like-minded practitioners committed to following the Buddha's teachings and upholding the Dharma. In summary, the Triple Gem forms the core of Buddhist faith and practice, representing the ideal of the Buddha, the truth of the Dharma, and the support of the Sangha. By taking refuge in these three aspects, individuals show their commitment to walking the Buddhist path and seeking enlightenment."},{"instruction":"The 41-year-old was walking in Westwood Crescent, Hamilton, when he was attacked by three men who got out of a dark BMW car at about 16:15 on Monday.

They included the collapse of the Middle East peace process and, in April, a crisis over a U.S.\\" spy plane\\" brought down in Chinese territory. The new administration also focused heavily on Russia, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, Europe, Mexico, and the Persian Gulf. In the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically. In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways agencies responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of the context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda. Except for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed specifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States-although the CSG continued to be concerned about the domestic threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected only abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI. Clarke had expressed concern about an al Qaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \\"Hizbollah, Hamas, al Qida and other terrorist organizations.\\" In May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness. The next few months were mainly spent organizing the effort and bringing an admiral from the Sixth Fleet back to Washington to manage it. The Vice President's task force was just getting under way when the 9/11 attack occurred.

The organization was responsible for the operation of naval aircraft and the conduct of aerial warfare in the Pacific War. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service's pilots received high salaries","output":"Although the opening statement introduces the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) and its role during World War II, it does not provide any information on the salaries of its pilots. However, I can provide context and additional information on the topic. In the context of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, it is important to understand the background and training of the pilots. The IJNAS had a rigorous selection process and an extensive training program for their pilots, who were known for their skill and bravery. These pilots, also referred to as \\"Kaigun Kokutai,\\" were instrumental in many major air campaigns and battles, such as the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the Battle of Midway in 1942. Regarding the compensation of IJNAS pilots, given the economic conditions of Japan during World War II, it is not accurate to claim that these pilots received high salaries compared to the global standard or even to civilian salaries within their own country. Japan's economy was strained by the war, leading to widespread conscription and a focus on nationalistic duty over individual compensation. However, when compared to other military enlisted personnel within the Imperial Japanese Navy, it could be argued that the IJNAS pilots received better compensation and benefits commensurate with their rank and training. Additionally, their status as pilots in such an elite organization would have afforded them a certain level of prestige and respect among their peers and society. It is also important to note that the concept of compensation in Imperial Japan often extended beyond just salaries to include social status and recognition for one's service and loyalty to the country. In conclusion, while it may not be accurate to claim that the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service's pilots received high salaries compared to the global standard, within the context of wartime Japan and the Imperial Japanese Navy, they were likely better compensated and respected compared to enlisted personnel in other branches of the military. This includes factors such as rank, benefits, prestige, and social recognition associated with their role in the IJNAS."},{"instruction":"Generate a negative review for a place.","output":"Once upon a time, a little boy named Billy went to a place called Yucky Land.

The regional bloc has promised to send health care workers, but there are concerns about whether there is enough protective gear to keep them safe. Doctors and nurses are at high risk of infection, and a higher proportion of health workers have become infected in the West African outbreak than in any other previous one. The outbreak began in Guinea and has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal, killing more than 2,000 people. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, chair of the AU Commission, told a meeting Monday that efforts to stop Ebola — like border closures and flights bans — have stigmatized the affected countries. ||||| A driver brings a sick woman to an Ebola clinic in Monrovia, Liberia. Kieran Kesner for The Wall Street Journal Milton Mulbon arrived in a taxi at the gates of an Ebola clinic in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, with his 24-year-old daughter, Patience, bleeding in the back seat. Guards turned them away. \\"They're telling me no space?\\" he protested, the taxi parked nearby. \\"She's lying down in there almost at the point of death!\\" Taxis, ambulances, and even men pushing their sick in wheelbarrows are crisscrossing Monrovia, looking for an open bed in West Africa's overbooked Ebola clinics, health-care workers say. Sometimes they get in, through persistence and good timing. Mostly they don't. Liberia's tradition of hands-on burial has exacerbated the Ebola epidemic. Burial teams now don biohazard suits to remove corpses, but they're struggling to keep up. (Photo: Kieran Kesner for The Wall Street Journal) Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea—the three nations bearing the brunt of the outbreak—need at least 1,515 hospital beds for the more than 20,000 people who could be infected before the outbreak can be curtailed, according to World Health Organization estimates. At present, there are only a few hundred beds. International support has been slow to come and is just beginning to address this specific problem, with the U.S. promising 1,000 additional beds in a new aid package. The shortage is so dire that ambulances have picked up people raging with the symptoms of Ebola, driven them around for hours, then dropped them back at home, medical workers say. The odds of surviving Ebola at home, without intravenous hydration, are slim. Along the way, the sick often infect their families. That is creating ever more Ebola patients arriving at the gates of overcrowded clinics. Some, like Mr. Mulbon, collect a bag of sanitary products and painkillers. His daughter, the mother of two boys, died within hours of receiving it. \\"She was helpless,\\" Mr. Mulbon said. Health workers complain they can't throw down mattresses fast enough. Some organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, are asking Europe and the U.S. to send disaster relief—even military personnel—to help West Africa get ahead of an Ebola epidemic that has been under way since December. \\"Many months into an Ebola outbreak, we're in the position of turning away patients who look like they have Ebola,\\" said Henry Grey, a Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator. \\"That's an indication of the direct failure of the international community.\\" Ebola patients at the hospital. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images A few foreign governments are beginning to respond. On Friday, the European Union said it would pledge €140 million (181.3 million) to the three hardest-hit countries, €97.5 million of it going directly to their national budgets. \\"The situation is going from bad to worse,\\" said Kristalina Georgieva, the EU commissioner for international cooperation, humanitarian aid and crisis response. On Thursday, the U.S. Agency for International Development said it would build 10 Ebola treatment centers with 100 beds each, part of a nearly 100 million aid package to the three nations. USAID Administrator Raj Shah said the agency is moving to fund and deliver beds and several hundred critical-care personnel \\"as quickly as possible.\\" The challenge isn't just delivering beds. It is training staff, said Jeremy Konyndyk, director of USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, which is coordinating the U.S. government's response. \\"We could get a bunch of tents and beds in here in no time,\\" said Mr. Konyndyk. \\"The hard part is who staffs those beds.\\" It takes between 200 and 250 health workers to treat 80 Ebola patients, according to the World Health Organization. USAID and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are both looking to recruit and train health workers to take care of Ebola patients. The CDC program will begin in late September. The trouble is finding doctors and nurses willing to treat a deadly disease—with no vaccine or formally approved treatment. In addition, the training is challenging, because they have to learn to care for patients while wearing cumbersome protective gear and meticulously guarding their safety. Meanwhile, USAID is giving sick people who can't find a free bed a home treatment kit. It includes bleach and disposable gloves, Mr. Konyndyk said. An estimated 3,685 people have been sickened by the latest outbreak, WHO says. About half have died. But those numbers represent a small portion of the true toll, the organization says. Because most Ebola victims are suffering at home, their deaths or recoveries aren't noted in any official tally. Now, as clinics open, some of those who have been fighting the virus at home are beginning to show up. A WHO clinic opened late last month in what had previously been a dental office. It was meant for 30 patients. But on a recent Tuesday, it was overbooked, with several patients sprawled out on the concrete floor, including children. The hospital's director was reviewing a list of patients in the car on her way to brief Liberia's Health Ministry. Dr. Anne Deborah Omoruto Atai counted 44 patients. It was an improvement from a week prior when they had more than 70 people in the clinic with patients dying on the ground, she said. Workers wearing protective gear stand inside the contaminated area at a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Monrovia, Liberia, on Sunday. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images \\"It's difficult to give them adequate care when they're lying on the floor,\\" she added. \\"We just leave it to natural selection.\\" Across town, workers at the Doctors Without Borders clinic were assembling a 400-bed tent hospital in the mud and rain. The field clinic they already have, with 125 beds, uses 350 head-to-toe body suits, 25,000 liters of water and 2,500 gallons of bleach—every day. Taxis pull up here so frequently that both Doctors Without Borders and the CDC worry the taxis themselves have become conveyors of the virus. The disease spreads through bodily fluids and if a healthy person were to put his hands into the sweat left by previous passenger, it could spread—and in a way that would be impossible to trace. \\"We're hearing stories of people taking four taxis across town,\\" said Caitlin Ryan, communications officer for Doctors Without Borders. Outside the clinic, two taxis pulled up at the same time. Once again, there wasn't any room for the sick. So a shouting match ensued. \\"We are all Liberians,\\" screamed a man who had brought a sick girl in his cab. \\"They think we don't want to help,\\" said Randy Tomanne, one of the guards. \\"Their child is ill. There's no other way you'd feel.\\" Later, a third taxi arrived. The driver said he had been paid 10 to take a family with a 6-year-old girl lying across their laps to a clinic. He had no idea it was an Ebola clinic. \\"He just said the hospital,\\" said the driver, Ibrahim Somir, while a man in a head-to-toe plastic suit sprayed down his taxi in bleach. Before leaving to try his luck elsewhere, the girl's uncle shrugged off the risk he'd put the taxi driver in: \\"What else should we do?\\" —Matina Stevis in Nairobi contributed to this article.

A post-mortem was due to be carried out this afternoon, as the murder inquiry got underway. The victim, named locally as Colin, is thought to have lived nearby to where he was attacked. Tom Dignam, manager at the nearby Eight Bells pub described the victim, who was believed to have lived nearby, as a ‘very nice man who lost his job and lost his way’. He said: ‘He had his own flat. He used to come in here a few years ago and was a respectable working gentleman, but he lost his job and had a nervous breakdown. ‘We had to stop serving him because he was letting himself go and shouting at people. I used to see him on the streets and give him a fiver.’ Mr Dignam said: ‘I spoke to someone who was cradling his head afterwards.

At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime.

Step 1: We know that 15% of the annual budget is spent on the public library which amounts to 3,000. To find the total annual budget, we'll set up a proportion: (15% of the annual budget) / (total annual budget) = 3,000 / (total annual budget) Step 2: We can rewrite the 15% as a decimal (0.15) and solve for the total annual budget: (0.15) * (total annual budget) = 3,000 (total annual budget) = 3,000 / 0.15 (total annual budget) = 20,000 Step 3: We now know the total annual budget for Centerville is 20,000. We also know that 24% is spent on public parks. To find out how much is spent on public parks, we can calculate: (0.24) * (20,000) = 4,800 Step 4: To find out how much is left of the annual budget after spending on the public library and public parks, we subtract the amounts spent on both: remaining budget = total annual budget - library spending - park spending remaining budget = 20,000 - 3,000 - 4,800 remaining budget = 20,000 - 7,800 remaining budget = 12,200 So, there is 12,200 left in the annual budget after spending on the public library and public parks."},{"instruction":"Thesecondunitcanbeusedforanadditionalcomponentinordertoe.g.produceacomponentindifferentcolours,withspecialtactilequalities,orasahard-softcombination.

The next big oil pipeline battle is here, and hardly anybody knows about it. “It saddens me to say that all evidence points to us being better informed about this project than our elected officials,” Bodenmiller said. “But that's only because officials and the press, with a few exceptions, have failed to advocate for those they serve.” A few weeks after she received the form letter -- and after The Times asked Stabenow's office for comment -- a staffer called to apologize for the mix-up, Bodenmiller said. Alberta-based Enbridge is moving forward with 8.8-billion worth of plans to greatly expand its U.S. pipeline network to pump more oil through nearly a dozen states. That work includes the construction of two new pipelines from Illinois and Texas and the expansion of a line running through Bodenmiller’s property in Michigan that will move 500,000 barrels per day through the state once completed. A somewhat similar effort by TransCanada to build an 830,000-barrel-per-day pipeline extension from Canada to the Texas coast — called Keystone XL — met national opposition from landowners, politicians and environmentalists. Their pressure put part of the project on hold because of a federal approval process managed by the State Department that allows the U.S. government to deny pipeline projects. That hasn’t happened to Enbridge, even though one of the company's proposed pipeline projects would take 850,000 barrels per day from Oklahoma to the Texas coast. A nuance in federal law allows Enbridge to improve its pipelines inside the U.S. as long as the work doesn’t cross the Canadian border, meaning the State Department does not have to approve. Enbridge is moving forward at the local and state level without the same friction faced by its competitor with Keystone XL, and expects to complete most of its projects by 2014. Local environmentalists and residents, worried about Enbridge’s safety record and requests to work on their land, have begun opposing Enbridge’s projects on their own. Ernest “Junior” Hamilton, a 69-year-old Holly, Mich., resident, told The Times that Enbridge offered him 7,000 for pipeline work that would tear up his yard, remove all his trees, pass over his drinking well and ruin his septic system. Hamilton refused to cooperate and now has a court date to determine whether the company could exercise eminent domain and take his land to do its work. “If the judge says, ‘OK, you can take his property,’ it’s done,” Hamilton said. “I just paid it off last year. Paid on it for 30 years, and now a judge can say [to Enbridge], ‘Oh, you can have it because you feel the need.' \\" Hamilton added, “Hopefully it will get somebody else’s attention, what they’re doing. Because it isn’t just me living out in the sticks.” The company says it has followed all the rules, contacting landowners to notify them and negotiating to secure the necessary property easements. Now environmental groups are discovering the limitations they face in opposing Enbridge’s projects state by state and county by county. In contrast, the Keystone XL battle provided a national platform. Activists with the Indiana environmental group Save the Dunes said Enbridge was avoiding their request to hold a state-level meeting with residents and environmental groups about pipeline work in Indiana’s three northwest counties. “Up to this point, we believe that the public has not been adequately informed of the project [in Indiana], and Enbridge has so far declined our request for a public meeting of state, federal and local regulators and concerned citizens,” Nathan Pavlovic, a land and advocacy specialist for the group, told The Times in an email. An Enbridge spokesman said the company had already held an open house with local residents and offered to meet privately with Save the Dunes about the project.","output":"Enbridge's Quiet Pipeline Expansion Sparks Concerns Among Locals and Environmentalists"},{"instruction":"Since2013thevineyardshavebeencertifiedagriculturebiologique.

Its broad brim obscured his features from the view of pesky eyes or satellite cameras that might blow his cover while he was hiding out in Pakistan, according to a report first published widely in Pakistani media. The 337-page leaked report details the domestic life of one of the world's most wanted men in his final days of life. Bergen: bin Laden's life on the run It also bashes Pakistani authorities for failing to keep the al Qaeda leader out of the country, and for failing to prevent the U.S. raid by Navy SEALs that killed him in May 2011. The report bears the names of a former top diplomat, a supreme court justice and former officers of the military and police.

Citing a news piece by Al Jazeera, the first to report the story, the official said the documents being discussed in the news are part of a report that was submitted to the prime minister's office. Bin Laden's death: How the story unfolded The famous terrorist's life was speckled with quirky measures designed to keep him under the radar, the report said. Al Qaeda's No. 1 spent lots of time doting on his some dozen children and grandchildren in the six years he spent in his walled compound in the city of Abbottabad, said terror expert Peter Bergen, commenting on the report. They could not pass time watching TV or surfing online, because bin Laden had no Internet connection and no satellite television hook-up. He also didn't have a phone line, all measures to avoid detection. For the same reason, the children were not allowed to play with other kids in the neighborhood. They spent the bulk of their lives within the compound's walls. When bin Laden was not personally giving them religious instruction, he took them out into the yard. He would award them prizes if they grew particularly good vegetables in the garden. Opinion: From bin Laden to Boston Bin Laden fled to Pakistan a month after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, moving from the south to the north and then hopping from town to town before landing in Abbottabad in 2005. While he was on the run, one of his wives gave birth four times and had to be taken to local hospitals, but it was obvious that she was not from the region. She spoke Arabic instead of Urdu, Pakistan's official language. Bin Laden's family feared this might raise suspicions. So, they told doctors she was deaf and mute. While on the run in the restive tribal region of the Swat Valley, bin Laden shaved off his recognizable beard, according to the report. Men helping him told others not to ask any questions about the tall stranger, who spoke Arabic. While in Swat, police once pulled bin Laden's driver over, but he quickly settled the matter before the officer had a chance to get a closer look at the clean-shaven man riding with him. After arriving in Abbottabad, a woman living in the same building with bin Laden recognized him from his image shown on cable TV. Her husband, who was helping bin Laden, went into a panic, the report said. He told her to mind her own business and forbade her and all other women in the house from watching TV anymore. Opinion: Who really killed bin Laden? The measures kept bin Laden from being recognized for years in a city also home to one of Pakistan's largest military complexes. The CIA eventually suspected he was there and recruited a Pakistani doctor to run a vaccination program in Abbottabad in an attempt to find bin Laden by locating his children through their DNA. Eventually the United States did find the al Qaeda leader and assassinated him during a special forces raid on his compound. He was later buried at sea, the U.S. military said. Although the SEALs were within Pakistan's borders for three hours, its military did not detect them. \\"The radar systems were not looking for that kind of intrusion from the Afghan side of the border,\\" terror expert Peter Bergen said. He feels sure that will change now. The report also dedicated 22 pages to fighting terrorism and keeping people like bin Laden from taking refuge in the country again. The report's authors blast Pakistani authorities at every level of government, intelligence and the military for not stopping the U.S. mission, calling it \\"a story of complacency, ignorance, negligence, incompetence, irresponsibility, and possibly worse at various levels inside and outside the government.\\" Pakistan's government considers the assassination operation a violation of its sovereignty, basically an act of war.

A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, nursing, business, engineering, or law. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute, as various professional schools offer graduate degrees (e.g., some nursing schools offer a master's degree in nursing). Also, some graduate degrees train students for a specific profession (e.g. an MSc or a PhD in epidemiology trains a person to be an epidemiologist). - The Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) is the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, located in Baltimore City, Maryland, U.S. It was founded in 1889 using money from a bequest by philanthropist Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins Hospital and the school of medicine are the founding institutions of modern American medicine and the birthplace of numerous medical traditions including rounds, residents and housestaff. Many medical specialties were formed at the hospital including neurosurgery, by Harvey Cushing; cardiac surgery by Alfred Blalock; and pediatrics and child psychiatry, by Leo Kanner. - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. - The Johns Hopkins University (commonly referred to as Johns Hopkins, JHU, or simply Hopkins) is an American private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1876, the university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins. His 7 million bequestof which half financed the establishment of The Johns Hopkins Hospitalwas the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States at that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as the institution's first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. Adopting the concept of a graduate school from Germany's ancient Heidelberg University, Johns Hopkins University is considered the first research university in the United States. - John Lewis Holland (October 21, 1919 November 27, 2008) was an American psychologist and Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University. He was the creator of the career development model, \\"Holland Occupational Themes,\\" otherwise known as The Holland Codes. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Daniel Coit Gilman (July 6, 1831 October 13, 1908) was an American educator and academic. Gilman was instrumental in founding the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale College, and subsequently served as the third president of the University of California, as the first president of Johns Hopkins University, and as founding president of the Carnegie Institution. He was also co-founder of the Russell Trust Association, which administers the business affairs of Yale's Skull and Bones society. Gilman served for twenty five years as president of Johns Hopkins; his inauguration in 1876 has been said to mark \\"the starting point of postgraduate education in the U.S.\\" - Heidelberg University (informally Heidelberg) is a public research university located in the town of Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities. It was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire. - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. - A psychologist is a professional who evaluates and studies behavior and mental processes (see also psychology). Typically, psychologists must have completed a university degree in psychology, which is a master's degree in some countries and a doctorate in others. This definition of psychologist is non-exclusive; in most jurisdictions, members of other professions (such as counselors and psychiatrists) can also evaluate, diagnose, treat, and study mental processes. Some psychologists, such as clinical and counseling psychologists, provide mental health care, and some psychologists, such as social or organizational psychologists conduct research and provide consultation services. - The Holland Codes or the Holland Occupational Themes ( RIASEC ) refers to a theory of careers and vocational choice ( based upon personality types ) that was initially developed by American psychologist John L. Holland ( 1919 - 2008 ) , Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University . The US Department of Labor ETA has been using an updated and expanded version of the RIASEC model in the \`\` Interests '' section of its free online database , The Occupational Information Network ( O * NET ) , since its inception during the late 1990s . - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

Shortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton (John C.

Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted political decoy named Efawadh (Baron Cohen), whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening the country's oil fields to Chinese and other foreign vested interests.

However, since the task is broad and does not specify any particular language, I will provide sentences in several languages for you: 1. Spanish: \\"Esta es una oración generada en español.\\" 2. French: \\"C'est une phrase générée en français.\\" 3. German: \\"Dies ist ein in Deutsch generierter Satz.\\" 4. Italian: \\"Questa è una frase generata in italiano.\\" 5. Portuguese: \\"Esta é uma frase gerada em português.\\" 6. Russian: \\"Это предложение сгенерировано на русском языке.\\" Each of these sentences translates to \\"This is a sentence generated in [language].\\" Furthermore, we can delve deeper into each of these sentences and analyze their constituents. In Spanish, \\"Esta es una oración generada en español\\", \\"Esta\\" refers to 'this', \\"es\\" is the verb 'to be', \\"una\\" means 'a', \\"oración\\" is 'sentence', \\"generada\\" is 'generated', and \\"en español\\" means 'in Spanish'. In French, \\"C'est une phrase générée en français\\", \\"C'est\\" is a contraction for 'this is', \\"une\\" means 'a', \\"phrase\\" is 'sentence', \\"générée\\" is 'generated', and \\"en français\\" means 'in French'. Similarly in Italian, \\"Questa è una frase generata in italiano\\", \\"Questa\\" is 'this', \\"è\\" is the verb 'to be', \\"una\\" means 'a', \\"frase\\" is 'sentence', \\"generata\\" is 'generated', and \\"in italiano\\" means 'in Italian'. Following suit in Portuguese, \\"Esta é uma frase gerada em português\\", \\"Esta\\" translates to 'this', \\"é\\" is the verb 'to be', \\"uma\\" means 'a', \\"frase\\" is 'sentence', \\"gerada\\" is 'generated', and \\"em português\\" translates to 'in Portuguese'. In German, \\"Dies ist ein in Deutsch generierter Satz\\", \\"Dies\\" is 'this', \\"ist\\" is the verb 'to be', \\"ein\\" means 'a', \\"Satz\\" is 'sentence', \\"generierter\\" is 'generated', and \\"in Deutsch\\" means 'in German'. Finally, in Russian, \\"Это предложение сгенерировано на русском языке\\", \\"Это\\" stands for 'this', \\"предложение\\" is 'sentence', \\"сгенерировано\\" means 'generated', and \\"на русском языке\\" translates to 'in Russian'. In all these sentences, you see a common structure that reflects the equivalent sentence in English: \\"This is a sentence generated in [language]\\".

Works of natural history include René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746). Outside ancien régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by M D Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Zoology. In the given context, natural history encompasses a wide range of scientific disciplines, including botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology, and mineralogy. These disciplines focus on various aspects of the natural world, ranging from plants, animals, and the Earth's atmosphere to the study of water and minerals. When considering the disciplines alphabetically, the last one alphabetically is zoology. Zoology is a branch of biology that deals with the study of animals and their classifications, behavior, distribution, physiology, and evolution. This discipline covers organisms from the smallest invertebrates, like insects and microscopic organisms, to the largest mammals, such as elephants and whales. Zoological research provides valuable insights into the diversity of organisms, their life processes, and their relationship with the environment and other living beings. During the Enlightenment period, natural history gained significant importance and popularity, especially among the upper classes. This era saw the rise of scientific literature that was primarily focused on the observation, classification, and description of the natural world. Works such as René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746) were essential additions to the field of natural history. These and other publications helped to generate scientific knowledge and exchange ideas across various disciplines. Natural history disciplines were integral to both medicine and industry during this time and were taught to students in universities and academies to prepare them for a myriad of careers, including medicine and theology. As noted by M D Eddy, natural history provided an ideal platform for promoting interdisciplinary discussions, bringing together different scientific ideas and fostering a collaborative pursuit of knowledge among the middle class. In conclusion, of the disciplines of natural history mentioned in the context provided, the last one alphabetically is zoology. The popularity of natural history during the Enlightenment period contributed to the growth of scientific literature and led to remarkable advancements in the understanding of the natural world, which in turn had significant implications for medical, industrial, and educational pursuits."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Numerology is a way of using numbers to describe a person's character, and to make predictions about future life events. Numerologists use the numbers 1-9, 11 and 22 -- also known as the \\"master\\" numbers -- to help a person understand his or her personality, life goals, and destiny. Numerologists consider yourLife Path number to be the most significant because this number describes your character. To find this number, add together all the numbers in your date of birth. For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5). In this case the total is 34, so this person's life path number is 7(3+4). Numerologists believe that people with this number are peaceful and affectionate but can also be very reserved.

Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the...

Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Are the particles in Beaker X more or less likely to bump into each other than the particles in Beaker A? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. A:","output":"The particles in Beaker X are more likely to bump into each other than the particles in Beaker A. This is because the higher temperature in Beaker X causes the particles to have more energy and move faster, leading to more frequent and forceful collisions."},{"instruction":"Question: Article: Life has changed in Mexico City. Streets normally filled with people are empty. One of the most popular professional soccer teams recently played a game in an empty stadium that can seat more than100,000 people. It's swine flu that has made life in Mexico City grind to a halt . Seemingly out of nowhere, swine flu has caused confirmed deaths in 12 countries as of April 30. It has sent a wave of alarm around the world. Governments are trying to find ways to prevent further out-breaks. The World Health Organization has raised its swine flu global threat level to five out of six. People may be familiar with bird flu, but they know little about swine flu. Swine flu is a contagious respiratory disease in pigs. It is caused by a type-A influenza virus. Humans can also catch swine flu. The virus causes regular outbreaks in pigs, but people usually do not catch it. However, there have been cases of the virus spreading to people, and then from one person to another. The symptoms of swine flu are similar to the common flu. They include fever, lethargy , lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea , and vomiting . The high proportion of young adults among the deaths is one of several mysteries about this virus. Most of the dead had lung damage. What caused it is not yet known. The virus spreads the same way the common flu does. When an infected person coughs or sneezes around another person, the latter is put at risk. People can get the disease by touching something with the flu virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. There are medicines to treat swine flu. Doctors suggest using anti - viral drugs. They keep the virus from reproducing inside the body. Although there are no vaccines for it now, several everyday steps can help prevent the spread of the virus: washing hands frequently; avoiding close contact with people who are sick; and avoiding touching surfaces that might have the virus on it. People may worry that they will get swine flu from eating or preparing pork. In fact,... Question: What is the main idea of the passage?

The price of basic food such as wheat and corn has stayed the same for quite a long time,about 30 years.But as the world's population is getting bigger,there's more pressure to feed more people,plus there's less land and water to go round. Another reason is climate change.Droughts and floods make it hard to grow crops like rice and grain.The price of oil has gone up and that makes it more expensive for farmers to run their tractors and to transport the food they make.And lots of fields are being used to grow crops to make other things that can't be eaten--which is bad news for hungry people. The main losers are poor people who live in cities in poor countries,who are facing higher prices for food.Some people are doing well out of the food crisis though.Farmers in rich countries like the US,Canada and Australia are getting record prices for their harvests.

Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia.

Felix Graham, when he left poor Mary Snow, did not go on immediately to the doctor's shop. He had made up his mind that Mary Snow should never be his wife, and therefore considered it wise to lose no time in making such arrangements as might be necessary both for his release and for hers. But, nevertheless, he had not the heart to go about the work the moment that he left her. He passed by the apothecary's, and looking in saw a young man working sedulously at a pestle. If Albert Fitzallen were fit to be her husband and willing to be so, poor as he was himself, he would still make some pecuniary sacrifice by which he might quiet his own conscience and make Mary's marriage possible. He still had a sum of £1,200 belonging to him, that being all his remaining capital; and the half of that he would give to Mary as her dower. So in two days he returned, and again looking in at the doctor's shop, again saw the young man at his work. \\"Yes, sir, my name is Albert Fitzallen,\\" said the medical aspirant, coming round the counter. There was no one else in the shop, and Felix hardly knew how to accost him on so momentous a subject, while he was still in charge of all that store of medicine, and liable to be called away at any moment to relieve the ailments of Clapham.

Its formation and the dating of its existence are actually complex and multifaceted topics because they involve several geological events, including plate tectonics, oceanographic processes, and climatic changes throughout the Earth's history. The geological and oceanographic history of the Southern Ocean can be analyzed across various geological eons, with the ocean as we know it today manifesting primarily over the past 50 million years. To conceptualize the development of the Southern Ocean, one must ponder on the continental drift and the events surrounding the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana that began approximately 180 million years ago. Gondwana included present-day Antarctica, South America, Africa, Australia, and the Indian subcontinent. The breakup of this massive landmass coincided with the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. Numerous geological events have shaped the Southern Ocean, with significant developments occurring during the following periods: 1. Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Periods (160-100 million years ago): The initial stages of Gondwana's fragmentation were characterized by the opening of the Weddell Sea Rift System that initiated the separation of Antarctica from South America and Africa. 2. Early Cretaceous Period (130-100 million years ago): The separation between Africa and South America continued with the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, while the Indian subcontinent still remained connected to Antarctica. 3. Late Cretaceous to Paleogene Periods (80-50 million years ago): The gradual separation of the Indian subcontinent, Australia, and New Zealand from Antarctica led to the formation of the Indian Ocean and the South Tasman Sea. Consequently, a precursor to the modern Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) began to develop. 4. Eocene-Oligocene Transition (40-25 million years ago): During this period, an essential stage in the formation of the Southern Ocean occurred with the opening of the Drake Passage between Antarctica and South America. The complete opening of the Drake Passage generated the full development of the ACC, an essential component of the Southern Ocean that influences global ocean currents and climate. 5. Neogene Period (23 million years ago to present): Throughout the Neogene Period, the Southern Ocean experienced significant climatic changes that resulted in the formation and expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet, which ultimately transformed the region into the ice-covered continent observed today. In summary, the Southern Ocean's existence cannot be pinpointed to a single date or moment in history. Instead, its formation is attributed to a series of geological, oceanographic, and climatic events that took place over millions of years. The Southern Ocean, as we recognize it presently, can be mainly traced back to the late Eocene Epoch (around 50 million years ago) and its full establishment following the opening of the Drake Passage. This vital connection allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to develop into what it is today, a defining trait of the Southern Ocean."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: \\"A group of teenagers wait to cross the street.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The group of teenagers is in the middle of the street.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise provided states that \\"A group of teenagers wait to cross the street.\\" From this statement, we can gather some information, but it is not enough to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis that \\"The group of teenagers is in the middle of the street.\\" To analyze the information given in the premise, we should break it down into its components. The premise reveals: 1. The subject: a group of teenagers. 2. The action: waiting to cross the street. Now, let us examine the hypothesis in question: \\"The group of teenagers is in the middle of the street.\\" This statement describes a potential location of the teenagers, specifically in the middle of the street. To determine whether the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise, we need to consider if the information provided in the premise leads us to believe that the teenagers are indeed in the middle of the street. Upon close examination of the premise, we can infer that the group of teenagers is most likely on the sidewalk, near the street, or at an intersection as they are \\"waiting to cross the street\\". If the teenagers were already in the middle of the street, the most logical assumption would be that they are in the process of crossing the street or that they have some intention other than just waiting to cross. Furthermore, the action \\"waiting\\" implies anticipation and preparation for a certain event—in this case, crossing the street—rather than being in the process of the event. In conclusion, while the provided premise does offer some information about the location and actions of the teenagers, it does not give us enough data to confirm or deny the hypothesis that \\"The group of teenagers is in the middle of the street.\\" The premise suggests that the teenagers are waiting to cross the street, possibly being near a sidewalk or an intersection, but it does not explicitly state their exact location.

The latest example came Thursday in a decision by renowned Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, with whom Scalia has an ongoing feud. Posner wrote an impassioned opinion for a unanimous three-judge panel to overturn gay marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. He said three past Supreme Court decisions in favor of gay rights — Romer v. Evans, Lawrence v. Texas and United States v. Windsor — didn't necessarily make gay marriage a constitutional right, although he noted that Scalia had suggested otherwise. \\"But Justice Scalia, in a dissenting opinion in Lawrence ... joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Thomas, thought not. He wrote that 'principle and logic' would require the Court, given its decision in Lawrence, to hold that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage,\\" Posner wrote for the Court. He was referring to Scalia's passionate dissent in a 2003 case which prohibited states from outlawing consensual same-sex sodomy. Scalia declared at the time that the Court had endorsed the \\"homosexual agenda\\" and had effectively knocked down the legal argument for prohibiting gay marriage. \\"Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned,\\" Scalia wrote. He made a similar prediction in the 2013 ruling that axed the Defense of Marriage Act. It was a cheeky move by Posner. As Garrett Epps, a constitutional law professor at the University of Baltimore, argued recently in The Atlantic, Scalia may have ironically made it likelier that lower courts rule for gay marriage by insisting that the Supreme Court had quashed the legal justification against it. Scalia and Posner, both appointed by Ronald Reagan, have been feuding for several years. In 2012, Posner wrote a lengthy piece in The New Republic attacking Scalia's newly published book, arguing that the justice's philosophy of \\"originalism\\" was a smokescreen for the goal of achieving conservative ideological outcomes. Scalia accused the judge of lying and the two have been critical of one another ever since. ||||| A box of cupcakes are seen topped with icons of same-sex couples at City Hall in San Francisco, June 29, 2013. WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court judge known for his outspoken views described arguments by Wisconsin and Indiana defending bans on gay marriage as \\"totally implausible\\" on Thursday, in a ruling in favor of same-sex couples. Judge Richard Posner, appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981, wrote the unanimous decision on behalf of a three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ruled against the bans. The unusually swift decision, issued just over a week after the court heard oral arguments in two different cases, does not take immediate effect and is unlikely do so until the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in during its coming term. The arguments advanced by both states in defense of the bans were \\"totally implausible,\\" wrote Posner, 75 and the panel's lone Republican appointee. \\"Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to marry. Homosexual couples do not produce unwanted children; their reward is to be denied the right to marry. Go figure,\\" Posner said. Posner has written dozens of books, including one about economics and intellectual property law. He also is a founding author of a blog on law and economics. Two years ago he engaged in an unusual public spat with Justice Antonin Scalia, a leading conservative on the Supreme Court. In a review of Scalia's new book, Posner wrote the justice's judicial opinions deviated from the strict, text-based approach to interpreting law espoused in his book. Scalia, also appointed by Reagan, publicly disagreed. EQUAL PROTECTION The ruling said the bans on gay marriage in the two states violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. Two other federal appeals courts have ruled the same way, striking down bans in Virginia, Utah and Oklahoma. The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the gay marriage issue during its coming term, which starts in October and ends in June 2015. More than 30 courts overall have ruled in favor of gay marriage since a Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 struck down a key part of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act under which states could refuse to recognize same-sex marriages from other states. A federal judge in Louisiana bucked the trend on Wednesday when he upheld that state's ban. Gay marriage is legal in 19 of the 50 states and in Washington, D.C. Wisconsin will appeal the ruling, said a spokeswoman for the state's attorney general, J.B. Van Hollen, a Republican. “The attorney general has always believed that this case will ultimately be decided by the United States Supreme Court,\\" spokeswoman Dana Brueck said. Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement that he will seek a suspension of the appeals court ruling and hopes for a quick decision from the Supreme Court. Hoosiers Unite for Marriage, a gay rights group that backed the challenge to Indiana's ban, said in a statement that its members were \\"incredibly grateful\\" that the court ruled so quickly in favor of couples who want to get married. Larry Dupuis, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, who has helped litigate the case, said he hoped state officials would \\"see the light on this\\" and end their defense of the ban.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The question proposes a scenario in which rain is expected to cause less harm, and as a result, more oxygen reaches the body. To determine the perturbation, we must first evaluate the steps in the process of oxygen intake and carbon dioxide exhalation: 1. A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth. 2. The oxygen travels into the body. 3. Oxygen breaks down glucose. 4. Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown. 5. The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth. Now, let's consider how the rain might influence this process in a way that allows more oxygen to reach the body: - Directly impacting a step of the process: Rain is an external factor that might affect a person's ability to breathe but not the internal mechanisms by which the body processes oxygen and carbon dioxide. The rain may cool the air or increase the humidity, making it easier to breathe, thus increasing the amount of oxygen intake (step 1). This would be a direct impact on the oxygen intake process, as it influences the mechanism of breathing itself. - Indirectly impacting a step of the process: If rain were to influence the oxygen intake process indirectly, it would have some effect on the external environment rather than the physiological steps outlined above. For example, rain might reduce air pollution, which in turn could improve air quality and oxygen availability. This improvement in air quality would enable a person to take in more oxygen with each breath (step 1), but the effect would be indirect, as it results from changes in the environment rather than the process of respiration itself. - Not impacting any step of the process: If the rain were not to have any effect on the oxygen intake process at all, it would mean that any perceived increase in oxygen availability was unrelated to the rain and could be attributed to other factors such as changes in physical activity or health. Based on the information provided, the supposed perturbation in this scenario would most likely be classified as indirectly impacting a step of the process. This is because the rain itself does not alter the physiological steps within the body that govern oxygen intake and carbon dioxide exhalation. Instead, it potentially influences environmental factors like air quality, which would then have an indirect effect on the amount of oxygen a person can take in through their nose or mouth (step 1)."},{"instruction":"Heat supplies the energy that causes motion. The deeper you go into toward the Earths core, the hotter it gets. At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core. The system operates like a giant conveyor belt. The motion due to heating and cooling is called convection. Question: \\"Why does the system work as a conveyor belt?\\" Answer: \\"Because the motion between heating and cooling\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not entirely correct or comprehensive. A more suitable answer would be because the process of heating, rising, cooling, and sinking within the Earth's mantle creates a consistent circulation pattern that resembles the movement of a conveyor belt. Here is the logical reasoning behind this answer: The heat from the Earth's core makes the mantle's rock semi-fluid and this heated material (because of buoyancy) tends to rise towards the surface. When it reaches near the Earth's crust, it is unable to break through completely. Instead, it starts to flow horizontally away from mid-ocean ridge crests. As it moves further, it cools because it is away from the heat source - the core. As it cools, it becomes denser and sinks back down toward the core through deep sea trenches. This entire process repeats in a continual loop, similar to how materials move on a conveyor belt, hence the analogy of the system working like a conveyor belt. It's important to note that this continual loop of motion due to heating and cooling is called convection. So it isn't merely the motion between heating and cooling, but also the sequences of rising, horizontal movement, cooling, sinking, and repeating that makes the Earth's mantle convection similar to a conveyor belt."},{"instruction":"Select from: --negative --positive Short movie review: artistic aspirations Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"To determine if the critic was thinking positively or negatively about the movie, we need to analyze the given short review: \\"artistic aspirations\\".

He is also an entrepreneur and anti-doping advocate. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Reno. He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations. LeMond is a longtime vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning of his relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari. His outspokenness placed him in the center of the anti-doping controversy. LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari, and has pointed out that doping products ultimately victimize the professional cyclists who make use of them. Said LeMond: \\"When I speak out about doping people could translate it and think it was about the riders. Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.\\" LeMond's most notable conflicts have been with fellow Tour riders Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis. He has also been critical of Alberto Contador, the UCI, and its former president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: \\"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.\\" McQuaid rejected LeMond's call for new leadership and was dismissive of LeMond. Ultimately McQuaid was defeated in his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy. Lemond had supported Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle.

The decision to hold a referendum in Greenland was mainly influenced by several factors, including political, economic, and cultural reasons. One of the primary reasons was the disagreement over the EEC's Common Fisheries Policy. As fishing is the most critical industry in Greenland, its government felt that the EEC's policy would have a negative impact on its fishing rights and resources. Another consideration was the desire to protect the unique Inuit culture and traditions, which Greenland's population felt were under pressure from EU membership. Greenlanders also sought to maintain and enhance their political autonomy by steering their foreign and domestic policies independently. The referendum held in 1982 saw the majority of Greenland's voters (53%) opt for leaving the EEC. The exit process was then carried out through negotiations between Greenland, Denmark (which continued to be an EEC member), and the EEC itself. The result was a new agreement known as the Greenland Treaty, signed in 1984, which came into effect on 1st February 1985. With the conclusion of the treaty, Greenland formally left the EEC. Despite leaving the EEC, Greenland continues to maintain a relationship with the EU through various agreements and has a status of an Overseas Country and Territory (OCT). This ensures economic and trade cooperation, and Greenland receives financial support from the EU through the European Development Fund for its sustainable development initiatives."},{"instruction":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: \\"Dave Hanson, world saver!

OPT: A). Yes B). It's impossible to say C). No Hypothesis: The town was founded in the century before the current century","output":"B). It's impossible to say The paragraph provided doesn't give any clear-cut information or date about when the town of Arromanches, located in Normandy, France, was founded. Arromanches is indeed indicated as an area where the Normandy landings took place on D-Day in 1944. Nevertheless, one must not equate this significant event with the town's establishment. The Normandy landings during World War II were historical events that occurred in an existing town, but they do not provide any information regarding the time of its foundation. Although it can be presumed that the town was established before the WW2 Normandy landings in 1944 - due to the existing infrastructure supporting such a significant event - the century of its establishment or whether it was founded during the 19th century (the century before the 20th century, which is typically classified as the \\"current century\\" in common context) remains undisclosed based on this particular text. To definitively confirm the hypothesis that the town was founded in the 19th Century or earlier, we would need further details or historical documents underscoring the town's genesis or laying down its foundation, which hasn't been included in the paragraph presented.

(AP) WASHINGTON -- With lawmakers trying to crunch the numbers on a 1 trillion health care overhaul, President Barack Obama is leaving the door open to a new tax on employer-provided health care benefits. Senior senators said Wednesday the benefits tax could be essential for the complex plan to be fully financed. \\"I don't want to prejudge what they're doing,\\" Obama said, referring to proposals in the Senate to tax workers who get expensive insurance policies. Obama, who campaigned against the tax when he ran for president, drew a quick rebuff from organized labor. For Obama, the health care debate got personal during an ABC News town hall at the White House on Wednesday. The prime-time program was the latest in a string of events designed to build public support for his plan to slow the rise in health care costs and expand coverage to the nearly 50 million uninsured. Dr. Orrin Devinsky, a neurologist at the New York University Langone Medical Center, challenged Obama: What if the president's wife and daughters got sick? Would Obama promise that they would get only the services allowed under a new government insurance plan he's proposing? If \\"it's my family member, if it's my wife, if it's my children, if it's my grandmother, I always want them to get the very best care,\\" Obama said. Earlier in the day, the administration and its allies pushed for a prominent display of progress in the Senate before Congress begins a weeklong vacation Friday. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., labored in a series of meetings to produce at least an outline of legislation that could command bipartisan support. Of the five House and Senate committees working on a health care overhaul, Finance is the only one that appears to have a chance at such an agreement. Baucus appeared especially eager to show progress before the exodus from the Capitol begins.Several officials said he was negotiating with representatives of the nation's hospitals, hoping to conclude an agreement that would build on an 80 billion weekend deal with the pharmaceutical industry. Hospitals were being asked to accept a reduction of roughly 155 billion over the next decade in fees they are promised under government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, according to numerous officials. Officials at the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals said they could not comment on any discussions. Baucus is seeking similar concessions from nursing homes, insurance companies, medical device makers and possibly others, noting that any legislation would create a huge new pool of customers for industry providers. At its heart, any legislation is expected to require insurance companies to offer coverage to any applicant, without exclusions or higher premiums for pre-existing medical conditions. Overall, Baucus has said he hopes to hold the size of any legislation to 1 trillion or less, and in private negotiations there were discussions about further scaling back eligibility for insurance subsidies from the government. Additionally, Baucus was still searching for ways to cover the cost of his emerging legislation, and numerous officials said he appeared roughly 200 billion shy of achieving that goal. They added that a proposal to make it harder for taxpayers to itemize their medical expenses was drawing renewed interest among key senators as one way to raise revenue. Current law allows those expenses to be itemized when they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. The proposal under review would raise that to 10 percent, officials said. At the White House, Obama sidestepped when asked if he was open to taxing health care benefits, a proposal he opposed vigorously in the campaign for the White House. \\"I have identified the ways that I think we should finance this. I think Congress should adopt them. I'm going to wait and see what ideas ultimately they come up with,\\" he said on ABC's \\"Good Morning America.\\" Organized labor weighed in quickly. Gerald W. McEntee, president of the 1.6 million-member American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said in an interview that union leaders believe Obama is \\"a person of his word.\\" He was referring to Obama's opposition to taxing those benefits during last year's campaign. \\"They're not going to tolerate that,\\" McEntee said of workers' views of that proposal.

This leads them to give the film a rating of three, suggesting that they did not entirely dislike it. In conclusion, the overall sentiment of the review is negative, with the reviewer expressing their disappointment in the film's plot, acting, and writing. There are a few redeeming qualities acknowledged, but they are not enough to recommend the film or categorize it as enjoyably bad."},{"instruction":"The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that released Off the Wall? is inside the article: Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona., can you guess it ?

Let's explore them further: 1. The ringing of the telephone. In this sentence, \\"ringing\\" directly refers to the audible sound that a telephone produces to signal an incoming call, or when it is seeking the recipient's attention. Essentially, it is the sound emitted as a result of an electric current running through the phone's internal components (such as a speaker) to create the sound we generally recognize as a typical ringing tone. 2. \\"The tintinnabulation that so voluminously swells from the ringing and the dinging of the bells\\" -- E. A. Poe. In this quote from Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"The Bells,\\" the word \\"ringing\\" portrays a more poetic and symbolic meaning. \\"The Bells\\" is known for its onomatopoeic play with the various sounds that bells create. \\"Ringing\\" in this context represents not just the physical sound production by bells but also the emotional and evocative feelings associated with bell sounds. For instance, bells may be rung to celebrate joyous occasions, to announce important events, or to accompany somber moments such as funerals.

In summary, the word \\"ringing\\" takes on distinct meanings in the two sentences provided. In the first sentence, it refers to a concrete sound produced by a telephone, while in the second sentence, it represents a broader, more abstract concept that embraces the emotional and evocative aspects of bell sounds.

Given these facts, what can keep mold from entering the respiratory system among the following options: - vaccinations - layers of fat - deep breaths - sweating - a breathing mask - moisture - organic molecules - hydrogen and oxygen A:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the options step by step: 1. Vaccinations: Vaccinations work by preparing the immune system to fight against specific diseases. They do not prevent particles from entering the respiratory system. So, vaccinations are not an appropriate option. 2. Layers of fat: Layers of fat serve the purpose of storing energy and providing insulation. They do not protect the respiratory system from harmful particles like mold. Therefore, layers of fat will not help in this situation. 3. Deep breaths: Deep breaths can actually cause more particles to be inhaled into the respiratory system. So, this option is not suitable. 4. Sweating: Sweating helps to regulate body temperature and remove waste materials through the skin. It does not prevent mold particles from entering the respiratory system. Therefore, sweating is not the right choice. 5. A breathing mask: A breathing mask is specifically designed to filter out harmful particles from the air before they enter the respiratory system. This is a suitable option for keeping mold from entering the respiratory system. 6. Moisture: Mold requires moisture to grow and thrive. Moisture cannot protect the respiratory system from mold particles. In fact, high moisture can promote mold growth. 7. Organic molecules: Organic molecules make up living organisms, but they do not provide protection from mold particles in the respiratory system. 8. Hydrogen and oxygen: Hydrogen and oxygen are elements that combine to form water molecules. They do not offer protection against mold particles entering the respiratory system. Based on the analysis, the most suitable option to keep mold from entering the respiratory system is using a breathing mask. A breathing mask filters the air and prevents harmful particles, such as mold spores, from entering the respiratory system."},{"instruction":"Question: This article: Barbie stars as Genevieve, one of twelve princesses who live in a castle with their widowed father, King Randolph.

That is a movie is supposed to be 'complete' and without too long passages of boredom or waste of time. This movie isn't. But I guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills, and considering this, this movie has a few highlights. If I am to comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project, I guess the distorted sound effects had some quality. They also manage to build some characters, this however takes me to what they should leave out in their next project, because the character building takes too long, since it is mostly irrelevant for the movie plot. Neither should the long spaces of time dedicated to walking around be continued in the next project - whats the point? I guess this movie tries to be a little bit of everything (building characters, suspense and a plot), and ends up being nothing (not a lot) This movie tries too much and too hard, and I guess it should have been cut to a short film. I could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue to cut from the movie. There is too much irrelevant things going on in this movie.

Rick Perry told the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute Friday that it is the responsibility of a conservative and compassionate government to protect the most vulnerable in society.","output":"Title: Embracing a Compassionate Conservative Government: Gov. Rick Perry's Vision for Protecting Society's Most Vulnerable Introduction In a recent address to the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, Governor Rick Perry highlighted the significant role of a conservative and compassionate government in safeguarding the interests of the most vulnerable members of society. Throughout his speech, Perry emphasized the need to strike a balance between maintaining the core values of conservatism while embracing a strong sense of empathy and understanding for those in need of assistance. The Argument for Compassionate Conservatism Governor Perry's stance on compassionate conservatism acknowledges the importance of providing a safety net for vulnerable populations while still adhering to traditional conservative principles. By promoting limited government intervention, fiscal responsibility, and self-reliance, compassionate conservatism encourages individuals and communities to take advantage of existing resources and opportunities to overcome socio-economic challenges. However, Perry's approach also acknowledges that certain demographics require additional aid and intervention from the government to truly prosper and achieve their full potential. Identifying the Most Vulnerable According to Gov. Perry, the most vulnerable populations include children, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, low-income families, and veterans. These demographics often face unique challenges, obstacles, and hardships, which can hinder their ability to overcome barriers and achieve economic stability. By providing targeted assistance and appropriate resources, the government can facilitate a more level playing field for these populations, allowing them greater opportunities for success and independence. Targeted Assistance Programs and Strategies Governor Perry's vision for a compassionate conservative government includes implementing targeted assistance programs designed to address the specific needs of the most vulnerable populations. These programs include: 1. Early Childhood Education and Intervention: By investing in high-quality early childhood education and intervention programs, Gov. Perry's administration aims to improve outcomes for children living in disadvantaged or underserved communities. 2. Health and Nutrition Programs: Providing access to vital healthcare services and nutritional support for low-income families, elderly individuals, and disabled citizens is crucial in improving their quality of life and reducing overall healthcare costs. 3. Job Training and Employment Assistance: Gov. Perry's administration stresses the importance of equipping low-income individuals and disadvantaged groups with the necessary skills and resources to secure fulfilling, well-paying jobs and achieve economic independence. 4. Veteran Services: The government has a responsibility to look after those who have served their country, particularly in terms of providing appropriate care, resources, and support for veterans struggling with mental and physical health issues. 5. Accessible Social Services: Ensuring that members of vulnerable populations have access to vital social services, such as housing assistance, mental health resources, and addiction recovery programs, is essential in facilitating their long-term well-being and economic stability. Accountability and Fiscal Responsibility To ensure that these targeted assistance programs are both effective and fiscally sustainable, Gov. Perry emphasizes the need for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment of government policies and services. This approach encourages cost-effective government spending while maximizing the positive impact on the lives of vulnerable members of society. Conclusion The compassionate conservatism endorsed by Gov. Rick Perry offers a viable, nuanced approach for governments looking to protect society's most vulnerable members while maintaining a focus on limited intervention and fiscal responsibility. By striking a careful balance between targeted assistance programs and fiscal discipline, Perry's administration aims to create a supportive environment for the disadvantaged, ensuring equal opportunities for all individuals to thrive and contribute to their communities."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Shohola Falls is a 2003 novel written by Michael Pearson.

This process enables the reuse of water which might have otherwise been wasted, reducing the overall water consumption of the household. 3. Environmental benefits: Using collected rainwater and treated wastewater for irrigation helps maintain the health of the native plants and landscape surrounding the property. This ensures that the property blends into the surrounding rural landscape, promoting a natural ecosystem and habitat for local wildlife. 4. Cost reduction: By reusing rainwater and wastewater for irrigation, the household can potentially reduce their water bill and save money, especially in areas where water costs are high. In conclusion, rainwater is being collected and moved into the cistern to conserve water resources, treat and reuse wastewater, benefit the local environment, and reduce costs for the homeowners."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Create a bean heating pad.

Identify the source of the sting or bite: First, determine whether it was a bee, wasp, mosquito, spider, or any other type of insect or creature. Knowing the source will help you better understand the severity and potential risks associated with the bite or sting. 2. Remove the stinger if necessary: In the case of a bee sting, carefully remove the stinger by scraping it out with the edge of a credit card or your fingernail. Avoid using tweezers, as that can push more venom into the skin. 3. Clean the area: Gently clean the affected area with soap and water to minimize the risk of infection. 4. Apply a cold compress: Apply a cold pack or ice wrapped in a cloth to the area for 10-20 minutes to help reduce swelling and relieve pain. You can repeat this every hour as needed . 5. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: Use pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help manage pain and reduce inflammation. 6. Consider antihistamines and anti-itch creams: If you're experiencing itching or an allergic reaction, consider taking an antihistamine or applying over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to the area. 7. Monitor for signs of infection: Keep an eye on the bite/sting area for redness, increased swelling, or pus, as these could be signs of infection. 8. Seek medical attention if necessary: If you experience difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, hives, facial swelling, or severe pain, seek immediate medical attention, as these symptoms could indicate a severe allergic reaction or a life-threatening condition. 9. Prevent future bites and stings: To avoid future incidents, use insect repellent, wear protective clothing, and be cautious in areas where insects or other creatures that bite or sting are commonly found."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer from: (A).

In order to engage in this behavior, it can be inferred that Riley needs to be near someone whose speech they can imitate.

Luckily she didn't hurt badly. She quickly climbed out and walked away. But her accident was caught on a mall camera. Then someone posted it on YouTube. The video was viewed almost 2 million times and received national attention. Jenny was angry with this, but she learned a deep lesson: Texting while walking is dangerous. This time I just fell into a sewer. Next time I didn't know what would happen. Maybe I would be knocked down by a car or something else. It was horrible. Jenny may be famous for her mistake. After that, she was laughed at by her friends and workmates. She _ what she had done. But it was too late. However, she wasn't the only one who got into trouble while texting on the phone.

Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line.

Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do?

Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

That's what it's like to be part of a royal family! You might live in a big palace and wear fancy clothes. But you also have responsibilities, like attending events and helping your people. Royal families have what's called a lineage, which is like a family tree that shows who is related to whom. It helps decide who gets to be king or queen when the current one needs to be replaced. So, if your grandparent is the king or queen, your parent might be next in line, and then you could be next after them!

He is stuck in the point of his life which makes him crave more than a crappy job at a restaurant and a couple classes per semester. When he is offered the job of assistant manager, he is forced to consider the potential benefits/disadvantages of accepting, beating himself up over the fact that his high school classmate recently graduated as an electrical engineer -- a fact his mother reminded him of at their lunch meeting at the start of the movie.Along with his roommate, Dean lives in a house that is the constant host of parties for everyone working at the restaurant, which only makes him wonder even more about his place in life.Dean's roommate Monty is an individual extremely concerned with his getting of the poontang, and throughout the course of the movie his comments are lewd, in-your-face reminders of his sexual perversion and infinite coolness.

I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand. According to the above context, answer the following question.

The Redskins started the game very well with Josh Wilson recovering a Danny Amendola fumble and returning it to the endzone for a 7-0 Redskins lead on the first snap of the game. St. Louis would fight back, however, and pick up a Greg Zuerlein 39-yard field goal to cut the Redskins advantage to 7-3. Washington would close the first quarter with a Robert Griffin III touchdown run to give the Redskins a 14-3 lead going into the second quarter. In the second, St. Louis continued to battle, as Zuerlein hit another field goal. However, on the Redskins' ensuing possession, Griffin III connected with Leonard Hankerson for a 68-yard strike on a play action pass, and the Redskins appeared to take firm control, with a 21-6 edge. However, St. Louis would prove resilient, led by Danny Amendola's 12 receptions in the first half, St. Louis pulled within 8 when Sam Bradford found the aforementioned Amendola to cut the Redskins' advantage to 21-13. Then, just before the half, Griffin threw his first career interception to Cortland Finnegan which set up Zuerlein's 42-yard field goal as the half ended to cut the lead to 21-16. In the third, momentum continued to swing St. Louis' way as Bradford found a wide open Brandon Gibson to give St. Louis its first advantage of the game. Griffin III continued to amaze as he found the endzone for a second time on the ground, and Washington ended the third quarter up 28-23. However, late in the third, for the second straight week, a Saverio Rocca punt was blocked, this time by St. Louis tight end Matthew Mulligan. To open the fourth, Bradford found Mulligan, and rookie Daryl Richardson scampered into the endzone for the two-point conversion, and St. Louis led 31-28. Washington was unable to get into position to tie the game, but had an opportunity late when Richardson fumbled and DeJon Gomes picked it up to give Washington the ball with less than three minutes to play. Washington drove the ball to the St. Louis 29, which would have set up a 46-yard field goal attempt by Billy Cundiff, but Josh Morgan was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct after he threw the ball at Cortland Finnegan, moving Washington back to the St. Louis 46, and making it a 62-yard field goal. Cundiff's attempt was wide right and well short of the distance, and St. Louis held on for the 31-28 win. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 1-1. Also, Washington fell to 2-3 in their last five games against St. Louis, dating back the 2008 NFL season. In that time, the Rams have compiled a 13-53 overall record.

To achieve this, it's essential for Matthew to identify the core reasons behind his lack of motivation and strategize ways to overcome them. Starting with identifying personal barriers, Matthew must evaluate why he is struggling to find motivation. Perhaps he is uncomfortable with the idea of working out in front of others, or maybe he's unsure of how to perform certain exercises correctly. Discussing these concerns with Joel can help alleviate any anxiety and create an open line of communication between workout partners. By doing so, Joel can offer reassurance, help demonstrate proper exercise techniques, and provide constructive feedback. Next, it's important for Matthew to maintain a positive attitude throughout this journey. Emphasizing the benefits of a morning workout, such as increased energy levels, mental clarity, and overall improved mood, can help nurture a more optimistic mindset.

This can involve tracking his improvements in strength, endurance, or physical appearance. Celebrating small victories and consistently reminding himself of the reasons he wanted to start exercising in the first place will provide a sense of accomplishment and fuel his motivation. Creating a sustainable workout routine tailored to their respective fitness levels and goals is crucial for both Matthew and Joel. Incorporating exercises that they both enjoy, or varying the workout regimen to prevent boredom, will make their morning sessions more engaging. By alternating between different types of exercises like strength training, cardio, and flexibility workouts, they can ensure a well-rounded fitness routine. Furthermore, working out together fosters accountability, support, and mutual encouragement, which can contribute greatly to Matthew's motivation.

Establishing a consistent routine by going to bed earlier, setting an alarm, and preparing workout gear the night before can help embed exercise as a natural part of his daily life. Once exercising with Joel becomes a regular habit, the initial efforts to motivate himself will gradually decrease and the benefits he experiences will feel more rewarding. Lastly, incorporating elements of fun and socialization in their workouts can enhance Matthew's motivation. They might consider joining a local sports team or signing up for group fitness classes that appeal to their interests. This can spark camaraderie and bring an enjoyable aspect to their fitness journey.

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","output":"Kenny will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm because his use of fertilizer is currently low due to growing tomatoes, which are not in season. On the other hand, Bobby has increased the use of fertilizer on his farm for his large order of potatoes, contributing to more potential dead zones caused by increased nitrogen runoff from his farm."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

Question 1 asks for the best hacks that help someone get free food, whereas Question 2 assumes that the person being asked has personally used hacks to get free food and asks them to share those personal experiences. To address both questions, here's a detailed answer for each: Answer to Question 1 (Best Hacks to Get Free Food): 1. Sample new products: Many grocery stores, especially large chains, offer free samples to customers in order to promote new products. Keep an eye out for these samples while shopping. 2. Participate in food-related events or fairs: Food festivals, street markets, or artisan fairs often have free samples from food vendors. Attend these events and try multiple offerings. 3. Use mobile apps and loyalty programs: Many restaurants and fast-food chains offer loyalty programs or apps that give rewards, including free food items or discounts, to customers. Download these apps and sign up for loyalty programs to take advantage of deals. 4. Attend store openings or special promotions: New store openings, restaurant anniversaries, or other special events may result in promotional gifts or food offers. Keep track of such events in your area. 5. Volunteer at events with provided food: Volunteering can not only give you a sense of satisfaction, but also access to events that might provide free food for volunteers. 6.

One such task could be constructing a stable tower using a set of blocks. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the task: 1. Assess the given set of blocks: Before starting, examine the number, size, and shape of the blocks provided. This is important to determine how they can be combined to build a stable structure. 2. Choose a stable base: To ensure the tower's stability, a broad and flat base is crucial. Start by selecting the largest and flattest blocks to serve as the foundation of the tower. 3. Distribute weight evenly: When placing the blocks, make sure the weight is evenly distributed on the base. This helps to prevent any tilting or imbalance in the tower. 4. Stack smaller blocks above the base: As you build up the tower, choose and place smaller blocks on top of the base in a carefully balanced manner. Avoid placing heavy blocks on top of lighter or smaller ones. 5. Utilize a strong structural pattern: The way blocks are placed can significantly impact the tower's stability. Incorporate interlocking patterns, like staggering the blocks, so that each layer's seams are not aligned vertically. This helps to distribute weight more efficiently and keeps the tower stable. 6. Maintain a steady center of gravity: Throughout the building process, ensure that the center of gravity stays as low as possible and in the middle of the structure. This will minimize the chances of toppling over. 7. Test structural integrity: Occasionally, gently push or nudge the tower to see how it reacts to external forces. If it starts to sway or wobble, adjust the blocks to increase its stability. 8. Know when to stop: As the tower reaches its peak height, acknowledge the limitations of the materials and tower design. Stop construction when it becomes evident that the risk of collapsing outweighs its potential height. By following these steps and focusing on the physical properties of the blocks, as well as the structural aspects of the tower, this task will effectively test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning."},{"instruction":"Article: An Open Letter to Occupy Oakland from the Oakland Police Officers’ Association November 11, 2011 On behalf of the 645 Oakland police officers we represent, this letter comes to you out of duty to protect the Oakland community and its citizens.

Right now, Oakland is in a state of emergency. Our police officers are the 99% struggling in Oakland neighborhoods every day to contain the 1% who rob, steal, rape and murder our law-abiding citizens. The Occupy Oakland protest, now 30 days old, is taking our police officers out of Oakland neighborhoods and away from protecting the citizens of Oakland. In an average city in California, this might not be of emergency proportions for its citizens. Oakland is not an “average” city – we have the highest violent crime rate in California. We are the 5th most violent city in the United States – with more shootings and homicides than any city west of the Mississippi. Last night’s murder, right in the epicenter of Occupy Oakland, is unacceptable. So is the violence being promoted by “renegade” protesters who are lighting firebombs, destroying property and attacking police. What is even more tragic is that homicides are a frequent occurrence in Oakland. This is the real emergency: Yesterday’s murder was Oakland’s 101st homicide of 2011. It is time for us to stop directing all of our efforts at policing the small enclave of “Occupy Oakland” and get back to our job of protecting the citizens of Oakland in the neighborhoods where our residents live. The events of recent weeks have shown that many occupiers at Frank Ogawa Plaza are citizens of other communities with limited interest in preserving the greater good and safety of our City. Please, we ask you: Leave Frank Ogawa Plaza peacefully and immediately so Oakland Police can get back to work fighting the devastating crime that’s occurring in our neighborhoods. You have sent the world a strong message; now it is time to go home. Your leaving today, peacefully, of your own free will, on the 30th day, will send a message to Oakland that you care about our citizens and respect our city.

LOS ANGELES | LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former U.S. Marine Scott Olsen, whose injury during clashes between Oakland police and protesters last month galvanized the Anti-Wall Street movement, has been released from the hospital, friends said on Friday. \\"He is out of the hospital as of yesterday or today, thank goodness,\\" Adele Carpenter, 29, told Reuters. Iraq Veterans Against the War spokeswoman Dottie Guy also confirmed Olsen's release to Reuters. Olsen is focused on healing right now, Carpenter told Reuters, but she added that \\"he is following the Occupy protests closely, as well as the vets march against police brutality today.\\" \\"He sent words of affirmation to friends during the Oakland General Strike and has been excited to hear stories from people who could attend,\\" she said. Occupy Oakland organizers say Olsen, 24, was hit in the head by a tear gas canister fired by police during a downtown Oakland confrontation on October 25. He was admitted to a local hospital in critical condition. Acting Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan has opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Olsen's injury but police and city have not said how they believe the Iraq veteran was injured. More than two weeks later, Olsen was released from inpatient care in time to celebrate Veteran's Day, Carpenter wrote in a blog post on a website for the group Veterans for Peace. The Iraq veteran was \\"still struggling with speech, but is attempting conversations without having the writing instrument out,\\" on which he had been relying to communicate, Carpenter said in the blog post. Word of Olsen's injury reinvigorated the Occupy Wall Street movement across the country, shifted its focus away from New York to Oakland and broadened its aims to include opposing police brutality. Activists in Oakland and elsewhere took to the streets en masse following his hospitalization, holding candlelight vigils and marches in his honor. Olsen served two tours in Iraq, working as a technician and earning a handful of service medals. Friends say he soured on military life after leaving the service started a now-defunct website called \\"I hate the Marine Corps\\" that served as a forum for disgruntled servicemen. Olsen received an \\"administrative discharge\\" from the service in late 2009, his uncle George Nygaard has said, though the precise reasons for it have not been confirmed. Such a discharge can result from any number of behavioral or disciplinary issues.

Lisa Murkowski (left), at the White House on June 13. | Getty Trump knocks House health care bill as too harsh The president offered no detailed directives, but pressed for a deal. President Donald Trump directed Senate Republicans to pass a generous health care bill at a meeting with more than a dozen GOP senators on Tuesday, arguing that the austere House health care bill is difficult to defend, according to people familiar with the meeting. The president also said Republicans risk getting savaged in the 2018 midterms if they fail to repeal Obamacare after a seven-year campaign against the law. Story Continued Below But he made clear that the Senate needs to pass a bill that Republicans are able to more easily defend and is not viewed as an attack on Americans from low-income households, as the House bill has been portrayed by critics, the sources said. He also advocated more robust tax credits for people who buy insurance on the individual market, a move that would increase the bill’s cost. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who is pushing the Senate to slow the repeal of Medicaid expansion, indicated Trump is concerned about the people who are enrolled in the program for low-income Americans. “He talked about the need to take care of people,” Portman said of the president. The gathering included 13 GOP senators of varying ideological stripes, from the moderate Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to the conservative Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas. The meeting left some Republicans on Capitol Hill with the impression that Trump is siding with more moderate Republicans, particularly when it comes to winding down Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, which brought insurance coverage to millions of people. Trump has told associates that news coverage of the House health care bill was “terrible,” in the words of one associate who has spoken with him. Trump threw a party in the Rose Garden celebrating the passage of the House bill and has publicly called it “terrific.” The most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time. But aides and associates said he has not liked the news coverage and has shown little interest in what is in the bill — but wants it to be received well. Conservatives want to wind down the expansion quickly and curtail future Medicaid spending, while more centrist senators are trying to preserve as much coverage as possible. Republicans said Trump spent a significant portion of the meeting observing senators disagreeing over the matter. Murkowski, who, like Portman, is from a state that expanded Medicaid, said she made it clear to the president that she is concerned about repealing the expansion. “I reinforced that I think Medicaid expansion has been very important to the state of Alaska,” she said. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is arguing to constrain future Medicaid spending to a rate lower than the House bill provides, said finding the sweet spot “remains a challenge.” “It feels like we’re making a little bit of progress. It’s slow, but it was always going to be a tough slog,” said Toomey, who attended the meeting. A White House official said Trump did not take a firm position on Medicaid, which is the subject of much deliberation within the Senate Republican Conference. Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, attended both the White House meeting and a subsequent GOP lunch on health care, playing point for the administration on the matter. And rather than instructing senators to meet hard deadlines, Trump urged Republicans to have a more orderly process than the chaotic one in the House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to call for a vote this month, though it may slip until July due to ideological disagreements and the difficulty of drafting such a complex bill. The president asked Republicans to set aside their vast policy differences and find consensus. “The message really was, ‘I know you have your differences, but work through them and let’s figure out a way to get it done,’” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). “We have to get a product.” “He wants us to pass this bill and improve this House bill,” Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah told reporters. Republican senators believe it will be at least a week before a coherent blueprint emerges for the GOP to chew over. Leaders are still going back and forth with the Congressional Budget Office to lay out options for Medicaid and tax credits and how much each option would cost. Hatch told reporters that he doesn’t think there will be a bill this week. If that prediction holds, it would be difficult for the Senate to vote on legislation before the Fourth of July recess. McConnell refused to tell reporters when a bill might be released or how long it would be available to the public before a vote. “We’ll let you see the bill when we finally release it,” McConnell said. “Nobody’s hiding the ball here.” Trump has taken a much more hands-off approach to the Senate bill than he took with the House version. Many senators expect the president to weigh in with more one-on-one or group lobbying as the GOP gets closer to moving a bill to the Senate floor. “He’ll be a big help, but I think the timing is important. And he’ll be an important part of this,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). “We need to consult among ourselves and come up with a consensus.” Adam Cancryn contributed to this report. ||||| President Donald Trump speaks before having lunch with Republican Senators and White House staffers in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, June 13, 2017. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Associated Press) President Donald Trump speaks before having lunch with Republican Senators and White House staffers in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, June 13, 2017. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional sources say President Donald Trump has told Republican senators that the House health care bill is \\"mean\\" and that the Senate version should be \\"more generous.\\" The remarks were a surprising critique of a Republican-written House measure whose passage Trump fought for and embraced. They also seem to undercut efforts by Senate conservatives to impose restrictions in their chamber's legislation, such as curbing the Medicaid health care program for the poor and limiting the services insurers must cover. The sources say the president did not say what aspects of the bill he was characterizing. Trump's comments were described by people who received accounts of a White House lunch Trump had Tuesday with 15 GOP senators. They spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal a closed-door conversation. ||||| Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told Republican senators lunching at the White House Tuesday the House-passed health care reform bill he celebrated earlier this year was \\"mean,\\" a source told CNN. Trump made clear multiple times that he was pleased that the Senate negotiations appeared to be moving away from where the House version of the repeal and replace effort ended up, according to three sources familiar with the meeting. Trump told the lawmakers that the House bill didn't go far enough in protecting individuals in the marketplace -- and appeared to use that as his rationale for why he has ambiguously called twice for the Senate to \\"add more money\\" to the bill. The positive comments about the Senate plan tracks with Trump telling reporters during the meeting that the Senate should spend more on the bill to make it \\"generous, kind (and) with heart.\\" But the comment belies the celebratory Rose Garden ceremony Trump hosted earlier this year when the House passed the bill and the President championed it as \\"incredibly well crafted.\\" The luncheon, which brought together the eclectic group of Republican lawmakers, was organized to give the President a chance to check in on the process, not twist arms with the hope of striking a deal, a White House official said. But his call for more funding could make it more difficult to sell the bill to House Republicans, who will meet with senators if the bill passes the Senate to reconcile the differences between the two legislative bodies. Additionally, according to Senate rules, the bill passed through the body has to save 133 billion, the same amount of money as the House bill. That leaves Trump and Senate Republicans with little flexibility on spending. While they can spend more money on certain areas, they still have to hit the 133 billion marker to comply with Senate rules. Republicans currently face a do-or-die moment to pass a bill. Since the House passed Obamacare repeal earlier this year, Senate Republicans have been crafting their own repeal bill behind closed doors. Now, facing a deadline if they want to finish the legislation this summer, the Trump administration is looking to step up pressure on GOP senators. \\"He made pretty clear that he thinks the House bill leaves people -- many of which probably make up his base -- in a bad place,\\" one congressional source with direct knowledge of the meeting said. While the meeting didn't include an in-depth policy discussion, it did touch on how Senate Republicans are working to re-structure the tax credit in order to address lower income and older individuals. \\"He's happy with our direction, and that direction is a departure from the House effort,\\" another source, asked to summarize the meeting, told CNN. Trump, according to senators who attended, urged quick action on health care, casting the debate as a promise Republicans made to voters that needs to be kept. \\"The message was that we need to get this done, it needs to be done right, but sooner is better than later,\\" said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, adding that Republicans can't move to other aspects of their agenda before they pass reform. Trump's lunch included a number of more moderate Republicans, including Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, and conservatives like Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. Portman, Cruz, Lee and Toomey are all members of Senate Republicans' working group on health care. Vice President Mike Pence, who has worked with Senate Republicans for weeks on health care, also joined the lunch. Portman told reporters the group also discussed how to get insurers back in the marketplace quickly. And Collins said Trump was \\"receptive\\" to \\"suggestions\\" about cost-sharing reduction payments that lower deductibles and co-payments.

MUST WATCH Here's how your tax dollars are spent 02:14 The Ohio Republican acknowledged the meeting didn't appear to resolve any differences, but added \\"that wasn't the purpose.\\" One GOP Senate aide said there wasn't a lot of substance in the meeting. \\"I think the whole point of the meeting was just the television shot of Trump surrounded by Ernst and Murkowski,\\" the aide said. The lawmakers specifically discussed structuring the bill differently than the House bill, Thune said, including ensuring the bill \\"protects people with pre-existing conditions\\" and using tax credits to \\"make the bill work for lower income, elderly people.\\" \\"I think he realizes our bill is going to move probably from where the House was and he seems fine with that,\\" Thune said. \\"But I think he wants us to be able to do our work and he feels good about the progress that we've made. But he wants to get the job done.\\" Referring to Obamacare as a \\"disaster,\\" Trump told reporters who briefly attended the meeting that the legislation he hopes to sign would be \\"phenomenal for the people of our country.\\" \\"Generous, kind, with heart. That is what I am saying,\\" Trump said. \\"And that may be adding additional money into it. We are going to come out with a real bill, not Obamacare.\\" Trump has so far largely left the Senate to do its work, remaining hands off through a difficult process. His legislative affairs team has been closely involved, but the President himself has been removed -- by design, multiple aides on Capitol Hill said. The President will likely accept whatever they come up with -- \\"Pretty obviously (he's) not a details guy,\\" one Republican aide said -- but will eventually be called on to help rally support for the final product. Trump will also meet with \\"Obamacare victims\\" on Tuesday when he travels to Wisconsin. Trump met earlier this month with families adversely impacted by growing Obamacare premiums in Ohio. House Republicans \\"have done (their) job,\\" Trump said in Ohio, and \\"now it is the Senate's turn to act, and again, I hope they are going to act in a very positive manner.\\" \\"We're keeping our promise to the American people,\\" Trump said Tuesday. Time is of the essence. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is still targeting a vote before the July 4 recess, even if there are only 14 working days left. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"President Donald Trump has directed Senate Republicans to pass a generous health care bill, describing the House health care bill as difficult to defend and too harsh. Trump argued that the Senate needs to pass a bill that could be more easily defended and not viewed as an attack on low-income American households, advocating more robust tax credits for those who buy insurance on the individual market. The president also warned Republicans they risk being fiercely criticized in the 2018 midterms if they fail to repeal Obamacare."},{"instruction":"If Lanai's upcountry, very upscale resort is appointed like an Old English estate, with writing desks, four-poster beds, library, music room., can we conclude that \\"The resort has discos and foam parties.\\"?

Drink the water that has not been boiled. Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night. So you should drink some water to keep your health after getting up in the morning. That can prevent high blood pressure, cerebral hemorrhages and so on. 2) Drinking water at about 10 am helps your body keep enough water. 3) Drinking water at about 3 pm can clean out the wastes in your body. 4) About eight o'clock in the evening is the best time to drink water. Your blood gets thicker when you sleep. Water will make your blood less thick. Besides, we should drink 2L of water every day. Water is so important for our life. We should drink water often.

Emily Allen. PUBLISHED:. 11:06 EST, 31 May 2012. |. UPDATED:. 12:08 EST, 31 May 2012. Anger: Warwickshire Chief Fire Officer Graeme Smith said the charges should never have been brought. The families of three firemen killed in a warehouse blaze have called a chief fire officer 'hypocritical', 'arrogant' and 'small minded' after he welcomed the acquittal of three long-serving firefighters who had been charged with manslaughter over the tragedy. Graeme Smith, the head of Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service, claimed Adrian Ashley, Paul Simmons and Timothy Woodward had been 'treated like common criminals' in the wake of the fatal fire at Atherstone-on-Stour in 2007. Jurors at Stafford Crown Court yesterday cleared watch manager Ashley, 45, and 51-year-old station manager Woodward of gross negligence manslaughter after hearing six weeks of evidence about the deaths of Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid. Watch manager Simmons, 50, was acquitted of the same charge on the directions of the judge part-way through the trial. Police never found the criminals who started the fire and £4.7million has been spent over five. years trying to pin blame for the losses on the managers who let the. firemen enter the building even though all employees had already been. accounted for. Speaking after the verdicts, Mr Smith said it was 'crystal clear' that the case should not have been brought to court and called for an investigation into why the three men were prosecuted. But at a press conference in Warwickshire today, relatives of Mr Stephens, Mr Reid and Mr Yates-Badley said they had been let down by Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service following the fire at a vegetable packing plant on November 2. The family of Mr Averis were present but decided not to speak. Ian Reid’s widow Julie said she had been devastated by the not guilty verdicts, adding: 'Why does Warwickshire chief fire officer Smith think this case should not have gone to court? Does he not think that where the evidence is there, action should be taken? 'Is he really that arrogant and small minded to think that firefighters are above the law? 'We are all accountable for our actions, even the police. No one is above the law. Victims: (clockwise from top left) Darren Yates-Badley, Ashley Stephens, Ian Reid and John Averis were killed tackling the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007. Their families are angry at the fire service's reaction to the manslaughter acquittal. 'We have a legal process in this. country and if the police suspect a crime has been committed they are. duty bound to investigate and pass their findings to the Crown. Prosecution Service. 'The legal process will determine. whether charges should be brought, not the profession of an individual. The jury could not find guilt in this case. But if this case makes. incident commanders take one extra minute to assess the situation. presented on arriving at an incident then that can only be for the good. 'A firefighter’s life is not worth. less than that of a member of the public and it most certainly is not. worth a pallet of packing material.' Mrs Reid, who described the fire. service as a 'sleepy hollow', added: 'I do acknowledge that the. defendants and their families have had a difficult year with this. hanging over their heads but it is nothing compared to the heartache. that Sophie (the couple’s daughter) and I have suffered for four and a. half years. Cleared: Watch Manager Adrian Ashley and Station Manager Timothy Woodward were found not guilty of. manslaughter following the deaths of four firefighters killed when a roof collapsed during warehouse blaze. Cleared: Station Manager Timothy Woodward speaks to the media flanked by Watch Leaders Paul Simmonds and Adrian Ashley yesterday. The three men were cleared of causing the deaths of four colleagues. 'I lost my husband, who I loved very much, and Sophie lost the dad she adored. Our heartache and loss is permanent.' Paul Stephens, the firefighter father of Ashley Stephens, was present at the blaze that killed his son. In a statement read on his behalf by a. police liaison officer, he said: 'As his father, and at the time a. serving firefighter being present at the incident, having witnessed the. horrendous scene on that night has left me with images that will stay. with me forever - images so strong I have not been able to attend the. court hearing. 'The loss of Ashley has left such a big hole in our hearts that it is impossible to mend. 'Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service. gave us unlimited support up until the charges were brought against. three of their officers. After that it seemed we were on the wrong side. and support dwindled down to nothing. 'To hear the Chief Fire Officer speak. to the press saying their thoughts were with the families was very. hypocritical as the only family support shown has been to the. defendants’ families. Tragedy: Firefighters Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid were killed as they tackled the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007. 'Ashley loved being part of the fire. service and wanted to become a full-time firefighter. It seems so unjust. that the full- time officers he would have looked up to have let him. down so badly.' Mandy Baylis, the mother of Darren Yates-Badley, said: 'That night will haunt me forever. 'I never thought I would feel so let. down by the fire service. They talk about brothers in arms and one big. family. This is not true in our case. 'Family and friends of Alcester Fire. Station, which we have been part of for 25 years, have crossed over the. street rather than speak to us. 'It’s as if we’ve done something. wrong. All we did is lose Darren in the most impossible way. Not to be. able to say goodbye... Darren didn’t deserve that.' Addressing the media at the end of the. trial, Chief Fire Officer Mr Smith said: 'It is crystal clear that. these cases should never have been brought to court. 'The police investigation into this fire took a wrong turn early on. Collapse: An aerial view shows the roof of the warehouse after it collapsed killing the four firefighters. The Fire Brigade Union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the CPS. 'The police treated decent fire officers like common criminals and the arsonist who started this fire has got away with it. 'It has taken almost five years and. £5million of public money to construct a case against these three men. and when it was presented in court it simply fell apart.' During two days in the custody of. Warwickshire Police, Mr Simmons, Mr Ashley, and Mr Woodward had their. belts and shoelaces taken away and were also held at a police station. overnight between interviews. Mr Smith said Warwickshire Fire and. Rescue Service and the Chief Fire Officers’ Association intended to. write to the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary to seek a formal. investigation why the firefighters were charged. After yesterday's verdicts, critics said. firemen may now hesitate before trying to save lives for fear they could. be arrested. Verdict:. After hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided Mr Woodward and Mr. Ashley had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on. the evening of November 2 2007. The police officer in charge of the. inquiry, Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence, insisted the. investigation was justified and said he hoped the fire service had. learned lessons from the tragedy. The union said it was absurd that the. arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who. struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the. CPS. FBU assistant general. secretary Andy Dark said: 'This was the first time firefighters at an. incident were accused of the manslaughter of their colleagues. 'This prosecution cast a shadow across the whole fire service and caused anger and concern. 'We are relieved at the not-guilty verdicts but firefighters are furious at the police and prosecutors. 'The. criminals who started the fire are still free, but those who tried to. put the fire out were arrested, charged and brought to trial.'

Their relations with the non-Native surrounding population have become contentious, in regard to excise tax advantages and to their property rights. In the 1990s, the Senecas won a prolonged court battle to assume ownership of all land on their reservation, including that owned by private non-Seneca. The city had been developed under a 99-year federal lease arrangement with the Seneca Nation. It had provided land to railroads to encourage development, which the railroad developed for workers and their families, and related businesses. This arrangement was confirmed by acts of Congress in 1875, 1890 and 1990. When that lease expired in 1991, the Seneca Nation demanded that the previous owners sign new leases with their nation for not only the underlying land, but also the improvements as well, or be evicted. The Seneca evicted fifteen property owners from their homes for refusing to sign over their properties. The increase in lease revenue from this reinterpretation has generated sufficient revenue for the nation to pay its enrolled members a quarterly social dividend, providing those members with a basic income. In a similar case in 2012, the Seneca ordered an eviction of 80 residents of summer cottages at Snyder Beach on the Cattaraugus Reservation, a location near Sunset Bay. They had previously notified the owner of the land that his leases to non-Seneca were not permissible, but he had done nothing to clear his property. Some of the residents were from families who had rented there for decades. The Seneca described the non-Natives as constituting a long-standing \\"illegal occupation\\".

Then back to the cable car terminal where you can catch a car to the upper level. The journey takes about ten minutes, I suppose, it's quite a long way. Now if you look at the other plan, the one for the upper level, you'll see where you arrive. B: Is this the terminal here in the bottom left hand comer? A: Yes, that's right.

Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point. Question: How did the facebook exec try to justify the Ugly memo?

To the world around him â including his traveling partner Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) and the bathroom mirror â he appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard. Stevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit, leaking oil. Communicating through a video screen, Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) verifies Stevens' identity, and insists he stay \\"on mission\\" to find the bomber before a large \\"dirty bomb\\" hits downtown Chicago in six hours. Inside the \\"Source Code\\" experimental device designed by scientist Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person's life within an alternative timeline.[a] Stevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bomber's identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times he cannot locate or disarm the bomb and dies on the train. But Rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real. It is revealed that he has been \\"with them\\" for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan. He is comatose and missing most of his body, hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is in his imagination, his brain's way of making sense of a missing environment. A confused and frustrated Stevens asks, \\"As one soldier to another, am I dead?\\" Angry to learn that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission. Rutledge agrees. Stevens catches the bomber Derek Frost (Michael Arden), who leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death, and gets off at the last stop before Chicago.

Wally Masur defeated Bill Scanlon with 6 -- 4 , 7 -- 6 to secure the title. In this sentence, Wally Masur is the winner of the match. The scores mentioned (6-4, 7-6) indicate the results of the sets played during the match, which led to Wally Masur's victory.

Article: Earlier this year,my oldest daughter got braces on her teeth,and let's just say she did not go quietly into that dentist's chair.Fear and hate pretty much describe the days leading up to her first appointment. So when she finally walked out with shiny teeth,a sore mouth and a broken spirit,I told her I was proud of her and took her to Ben &Jerry's for an ice cream reward.Two weeks later,we returned to the scene of the crime.The dentist spent about 45 seconds checking her teeth before sending her on her merry way.Before I could start the car, she was placing her ice cream order.She was shocked when I told her that she wasn't going to get a reward every time we get her teeth checked. Clearly,she's not alone.According to some parenting experts,kids are easily addicted to a benefit--producing system of parental rewards and bribes--it's not all ice creams,candies and cool toys.Some parents are offering their children prizes to just let them sit down and behave in a restaurant--or sleep in their own beds--or score a goal in the next soccer game. While the experts agree that occasional awards are okay, the danger lies in the system's overuse.Kids quickly gain a sense of entitlement ,where they come to expect a big reward for every good thing that they do,no matter how small.To keep things in check,experts say parents should reduce the number of rewards they offer,make sure rewards match the behavior and explain the real benefits of behaving for the sake of behaving.

To provide a detailed understanding of the origin and meaning of the term, it's helpful to break it down into its Latin components and explore their implications. The phrase \\"pro bono\\" is an abbreviation of the longer Latin term \\"pro bono publico,\\" which directly translates to \\"for the public good.\\" Let's examine each part of this phrase: 1. Pro: The Latin preposition \\"pro\\" carries the sense of \\"for\\" or \\"in favor of.\\" It is used to denote support, advocacy, or allegiance to a specific cause or entity. 2. Bono: \\"Bono\\" is the ablative singular form of the Latin noun \\"bonum,\\" which means \\"good\\" or \\"advantage.\\" In this context, it refers to the benefit or welfare of a larger collective, such as a community or society. 3. Publico: \\"Publico\\" is the ablative form of the Latin adjective \\"publicus,\\" which means \\"public\\" or \\"belonging to the people.\\" It denotes a collective group or entity rather than a private individual or organization. When combined, \\"pro bono publico\\" emphasizes rendering services for the benefit and welfare of the general public rather than for private gain or profit. In the modern context, the term \\"pro bono\\" is predominantly used in connection with the legal profession to denote legal services offered voluntarily and without any financial cost to individuals, nonprofit organizations, or social causes that may not be able to afford adequate legal representation. The roots of the pro bono concept can be traced back to ancient Roman law and that era's emphasis on social responsibility. Lawyers in the Roman Empire were known to provide legal assistance to help less fortunate community members. Over time, as modern legal systems evolved, the principle of providing legal services pro bono endured and became an important component of ethical conduct for legal professionals. In today's world, many law firms, bar associations, and legal aid organizations encourage attorneys to take up pro bono work as a part of their regular practice to help increase access to justice for the underprivileged, to advance public interest causes, and to increase goodwill towards the legal profession in general. While not universally mandated, some jurisdictions have implemented pro bono requirements for legal professionals as a part of their licensure obligations. In summary, the word \\"pro bono\\" comes from the Latin phrase \\"pro bono publico,\\" meaning \\"for the public good.\\" It has a strong historical foundation rooted in ancient Roman law and serves as an enduring reminder of the social responsibility and ethical obligation of legal professionals to provide services for the benefit of their communities."},{"instruction":"Information: - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

Translate to English English:","output":"In this context, it is essential to avoid the so-called December rush. When approaching the end-of-year holidays and activities, it is not uncommon to experience increased stress and a sense of urgency in completing various tasks, both personal and professional. This phenomenon is often referred to as the \\"December rush.\\" In order to maintain a healthier and more balanced lifestyle, it is crucial to take steps to avoid this overwhelming time of the year. One approach to prevent the December rush is to plan ahead, prioritizing tasks and setting realistic deadlines for their completion. By organizing your time and responsibilities effectively, you can evade the race against the clock that often occurs in the month of December. Another essential aspect of avoiding the December rush is to set boundaries and make sure to allocate enough time for self-care, relaxation, and engaging in activities that you genuinely enjoy. It's okay to say no to certain obligations, thereby preventing an overbooked schedule that only adds to the pressure. Additionally, it's crucial to pay attention to your mental and emotional well-being. The December rush affects not only your physical health but also your psychological state, leading to increased anxiety, frustration, and even a sense of burnout. To counteract this, make sure to engage in practices such as meditation, exercise, spending time with loved ones, or participating in relaxing hobbies. These activities help alleviate stress and might even provide an outlet for decompression. Another useful tactic to avoid the December rush is to set realistic expectations for yourself and others during this time. Acknowledge that the number of tasks on your to-do list might be greater than your available time, and that it's okay for some things to remain unfinished or be postponed. As long as you're making progress and dedicating time to the essential tasks on your list, it's important to give yourself credit for the work you've done and not dwell on the things you haven't. Remember to maintain open communication with your colleagues, family members, and friends, as they can offer support, advice, and, in some cases, assistance in completing tasks or reaching goals. This way, you can address the pressure from the December rush collectively, as opposed to shouldering the burden alone. In summary, avoiding the December rush is about careful planning, setting realistic boundaries and expectations, staying attentive to your mental and emotional well-being, and cultivating a network of support amongst those around you. By taking these steps, you can ensure a more enjoyable and less-stressful end-of-year experience."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A large crane lifting an object.\\" is it true that \\"Cranes can lift large objects.\\"? Let's be accurate as possible and think first.","output":"To answer this question accurately, let's break down the given sentence and analyze its components. The sentence is: \\"A large crane lifting an object.\\" 1. It mentions a \\"large crane,\\" which refers to a type of machinery capable of lifting heavy objects. 2. It implies that the crane is performing the action of lifting an object. So, based on this information, it is reasonable to infer that \\"Cranes can lift large objects.\\" However, there is one ambiguity in the original sentence: 1. It does not specify the size of the object that the crane is lifting. Since we only know that the crane is lifting \\"an object\\" and not explicitly a \\"large object,\\" we cannot conclusively determine if it is always true that cranes can lift large objects based only on the given sentence.

Biard and Gary Pittman discovered near-infrared (900 nm) light emission from a tunnel diode they had constructed on a GaAs substrate. By October 1961, they had demonstrated efficient light emission and signal coupling between a GaAs p-n junction light emitter and an electrically-isolated semiconductor photodetector. On August 8, 1962, Biard and Pittman filed a patent titled \\"Semiconductor Radiant Diode\\" based on their findings, which described a zinc diffused p–n junction LED with a spaced cathode contact to allow for efficient emission of infrared light under forward bias. After establishing the priority of their work based on engineering notebooks predating submissions from G.E. Labs, RCA Research Labs, IBM Research Labs, Bell Labs, and Lincoln Lab at MIT, the U.S. patent office issued the two inventors the patent for the GaAs infrared (IR) light-emitting diode (U.S. Patent US3293513), the first practical LED. Immediately after filing the patent, Texas Instruments (TI) began a project to manufacture infrared diodes. In October 1962, TI announced the first LED commercial product (the SNX-100), which employed a pure GaAs crystal to emit a 890 nm light output.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering the ability of humans to survive without sleep, first, we can recall the well-known fact that sleep is a crucial function for maintaining overall health and well-being. It is during sleep that our bodies undergo necessary physiological processes such as tissue repair, memory consolidation, and hormone regulation. Moreover, the lack of sleep is commonly associated with a wide array of negative health effects. For instance, continuous sleep deprivation can lead to impaired cognitive function, decreased immune response, and increased risk of chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, we can think of a few known scientific records of fatal insomnia, a rare and incurable condition that leads to a complete inability to sleep. People affected by this disorder ultimately succumb to their condition as their bodies and minds deteriorate due to the total lack of sleep. Similarly, even in experimental settings where sleep has been restricted for long periods, the subjects usually experience severe health issues and cognitive impairments. Another perspective to consider is that all animals, across different species, exhibit some form of sleep behavior, indicating sleep as a biologically essential function for survival. Evolutionary biology suggests that organisms evolve to meet their specific survival needs and it stands to reason that sleep, being a universal need, is fundamental to an organism's survival. Finally, taking these points into account - the many detrimental health effects of sleep deprivation, the evidence from fatal insomnia cases, and the evolutionary perspective - we can conclude that our initial question \\"Is it possible for humans to survive without sleep?\\" can be answered with a definitive \\"No.\\""},{"instruction":"Q:Context: aubrey saw her mom was sick so she took her to the hospital.

Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotions, opinions, or attitudes a piece of text conveys. In this case, the tweet appears to convey a mildly negative sentiment. The tweet seems to express a feeling of disappointment or regret due to not having obtained one of the \\"708 magnets.\\" There is also an element of curiosity as the author seeks to know if anyone else has one. Breaking down the different elements of the tweet can lead to a more in-depth understanding of the sentiment: 1.

Context: To fully understand the sentiment, one must consider the context surrounding the mention of \\"708 magnets.\\" If the magnets signify an exclusive or limited-edition item, this tweet's negative sentiment could be heightened as the author might express their regret more keenly. On the other hand, if the magnets were widespread and readily available, the sentiment expressed might be less intense. 4. Intent: Lastly, the intent of the tweet plays a crucial role in describing its sentiment.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes.

I have always liked the 1990's shows of Space Ghost! This show was hilarious and I can't believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would take such a funny show like this off the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from the Space Ghost cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his every day life with his Mom and Dad and his best friend who likes to drop in a lot, Zorak! My favorite episodes were the one where Zorak gets this really good singing voice and then his voice doesn't give him any money that Zorak made from singing at all. Another episode I like is the one where Brak and Zorak didn't finish their homework and then they go back from Sunday to Friday and they just goof off and then they go back to the day homework was invented and then when they go back to the present homework didn't exist! Another episode I like is the one where Brak's Dad and their next door neighbor, Thundercleese the Robot keep getting into this agrument and then they get eaten by a giant worm.

Identify a quote: \\"saith the LORD\\" indicates a quotation, so double quotes are inserted around the spoken part. 2. Determine sentence structure: The text has two contrasting ideas, so a semicolon is added between \\"to save thee\\" and \\"though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee.\\" 3. Separate contrasting ideas: A comma is added after \\"yet\\" to link the contrasting statement to the previous phrase. 4. Identify list items: The final part of the text lists two actions the Lord will take - \\"correct thee in measure\\" and \\"not leave thee altogether unpunished.\\" So a comma is added after \\"but I will correct thee in measure\\" to separate these two items. 5.

Neilston (Scots: Neilstoun, Scottish Gaelic: Baile Nèill, pronounced [paləˈnɛːʎ]) is a village and parish in East Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. It is in the Levern Valley, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Barrhead, 3.8 miles (6.1 km) south of Paisley, and 5.7 miles (9.2 km) south-southwest of Renfrew, at the southwestern fringe of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5,000 people. Neilston is mentioned in documents from the 12th century, when the feudal lord Robert de Croc, endowed a chapel to Paisley Abbey to the North. Neilston Parish Church—a Category B listed building—is said to be on the site of this original chapel and has been at the centre of the community since 1163. Little remains of the original structure. Before industrialisation, Neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-storey houses, many of them thatched. Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax. The urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale textile processing was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several cotton mills. Neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a spinning and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former milling village, agriculture has played, and continues to play, an economic role. The annual Neilston Agricultural Show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest Scotland each spring.Although heavy industry died out in the latter half of the 20th century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Neilston has continued to grow as a commuter village, supported by its position between Paisley and Glasgow, from roughly 1,000...

Is \\"If harm cannot be avoided, the project agency can seek an exemption from the Endangered Species Committee, an ad hoc panel composed of members from the executive branch and at least one appointee from the state where the project is to occur.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, the statement you provided correctly explains the process when seeking an exemption for cases where a species may be harmed. In situations where harm to an endangered species cannot be completely avoided during a project, the project agency may seek an exemption from the Endangered Species Committee (ESC). The Endangered Species Committee, also known as the \\"God Squad,\\" is an ad hoc panel composed of members from several executive departments, including the Secretaries of Agriculture, the Army, Energy, and Interior, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additionally, at least one appointee from the state where the project is taking place is included to represent the state's interest in the decision-making process. The role of the Endangered Species Committee is to review projects that may harm or jeopardize the existence of endangered species, especially in instances where no feasible alternatives exist. The ESC then evaluates the project considering economic, social, and ecological factors, and makes a determination on whether to grant an exemption for the project, allowing it to proceed, despite potential harm to the species involved. It is worth noting that obtaining an exemption from the Endangered Species Committee is considered a last resort scenario, as adjustments and mitigations are usually attempted first to avoid or minimize harm to the species. The exemption process is very rare, and the ESC has only convened a few times throughout its history since the implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the 1970s. In summary, the Endangered Species Committee is an ad hoc panel that includes members from the executive branch along with at least one appointee from the state where the project is occurring. Their main role is to evaluate projects that may unavoidably cause harm to endangered species, and decide whether exemptions should be granted for such projects based on economic, social, and ecological considerations."},{"instruction":"Question: when does the electoral college votes? Would \\"The Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The Electoral College casts their votes after the general election in the United States. The election takes place every four years, on the first Tuesday of November. Once the general election is held, states certify their election results, which typically takes a few weeks after the election. The Electoral College members, called electors, then meet in December to cast their votes for the President and Vice President of the United States. These electors are chosen by the political parties in each state, and their number is based on the state's representation in Congress, with each state having a number of electors equal to the total of its Representatives and Senators. The District of Columbia (D.C.) is also allocated electoral votes, even though it does not have voting representation in Congress, due to the Twenty-third Amendment. As for your statement, \\"The Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors,\\" it accurately reflects the historical outcome of the amendment. Ratified in 1961, the Twenty-third Amendment granted the District of Columbia the ability to participate in presidential elections, by assigning it the same number of electors it would be entitled to if it were a state, up to the number of electors held by the least populous state. The least populous states have always had three electors, hence the District of Columbia has consistently been allocated three electoral votes. With the passage of the Twenty-third Amendment, citizens of D.C. have been able to cast their votes in presidential elections. However, it's important to bear in mind that the influence of the Electoral College goes beyond just the District of Columbia, as it determines the outcomes of presidential elections on a nationwide scale, with the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes (270 or more) winning the presidency. In summary, the Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors. The Electoral College casts its votes in December following the general election, which is held on the first Tuesday of November every four years. The role of the Electoral College is significant in determining the winner of the U.S. presidential election."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: An electrical insulator slows the transfer of electricity.

Looking at both facts, we can conclude that the coating acts as an electrical insulator. Now, let's evaluate the given options in relation to the question \\"a coating does what to the transfer of electricity\\": - amplifies (no, since an insulator slows the transfer) - energy (not specific enough, and not directly related to the transfer) - heat (not relevant to the transfer of electricity in this case) - causes (doesn't match with the insulator property) - slows (this could be a possible answer because it matches with the insulator behavior) - reduce (reducing is almost synonymous with slowing, so this could also be a possible answer) - enables (counterintuitive, as insulators impede the transfer) - retina (completely unrelated to the topic) After evaluating each option, we can conclude that the coating either \\"slows\\" or \\"reduces\\" the transfer of electricity. Since the focus is on what the coating does to the transfer of electricity, \\"slows\\" seems more appropriate.

However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When gamblers \\"Sleepy\\" Bill Burns and Billy Maharg get wind of the players' discontent, they offer a select group of Sox â including star knuckleball pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who led the majors with a 29-7 win-loss record and has an earned run average of just 1.82 â more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Cicotte's motivation for being involved was because Comiskey refused him a promised 10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone until Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for 2 weeks (missing 5 starts) to rest the 35-year-old veteran's arm for the series. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. Jackson is depicted as being not bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte (pitching in Game 1) deliberately hits Reds leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back with his second pitch in a prearranged signal to gangster Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on (Rothstein allegedly financed the fix). Cicotte then pitches poorly and gave up 5 runs in four inningsâfour of them in the 4th, including a triple given up to Reds pitcher Walter \\"Dutch\\" Ruether. He is then relieved by Gleason, though the Sox lose the first game 9â1. Williams also pitched poorly in Game 2, while Gandil, Risberg and Hap Felsch made glaring mistakes on the field.

When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow. Zachow had taught the young George...

In this context, \\"niistä\\" is used to indicate \\"one of those\\" effects. - vaikutuksista (from the effects) - \\"Vaikutus\\" stands for \\"effect\\" in Finnish. \\"-sta\\" (-ista) ending is added to create the Finnish word for \\"from the effects\\" or \\"of the effects.\\" - jotka (which) - \\"Jotka\\" serves as a relative pronoun used to link two clauses. - mainitsin (I mentioned) - This verb is the first person, past tense of \\"mainita\\" (to mention). The subject pronoun \\"I\\" is not required, as the verb in Finnish already implies its meaning. - aiemmin (previously) - The word \\"aiemmin\\" acts as an adverb to provide information about the time when something happened. - liittyen (related to) - \\"Liittyen\\" functions as an adverb meaning \\"related to\\" or \\"concerning.\\" - euroon (the euro) - Here, \\"euro\\" refers to the European currency. The \\"-oon\\" (-än) ending is added to show that the sentence pertains to the Euro. Altogether, the translation of \\"This is one of the effects of the euro which I mentioned previously\\" is \\"Tämä on yksi niistä vaikutuksista, jotka mainitsin aiemmin liittyen euroon.\\" This maintains the original meaning of the English sentence while conforming to appropriate Finnish grammar and sentence structure."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

Ask a local home improvement store employee if you are unsure whether or not these laws exist in your area..","output":"After considering all the available options and checking local land laws regarding keeping quail in your backyard, the next steps in the process of buying quail chicks are as follows: 1. Research different quail breeds: Familiarize yourself with various breeds of quail and choose a breed that suits your requirements and preferences. Some common breeds include Coturnix, Bobwhite, and Button quail. Each breed has its distinguishing characteristics, such as egg-laying capacity, size, appearance, and temperament. You should consider these factors while making your decision. 2. Locate a reputable breeder or hatchery: Search online or ask for recommendations from friends, local poultry clubs, or online communities to find a reputable breeder or hatchery that sells quail chicks. The quality of your chicks will directly impact their growth, productivity, and overall health. Therefore, it is essential to acquire them from a trustworthy source. 3. Decide on the number of quail chicks: The number of quail chicks you wish to buy will depend on your purpose for raising them, available space, time commitment, and local regulations. In case of restrictions on the number of quail you can keep, abide by the regulations to avoid any legal complications. 4. Prepare the brooder: Before bringing the chicks home, set up a brooder - a controlled and safe environment for them to thrive in during their initial weeks. Chicks need warmth, clean bedding, water, and food. Ensure you have a suitable heat source like a heat lamp, a comfortable and hygienic substrate such as pine shavings, and enough space for the chicks to move around. 5. Purchase necessary supplies: Acquire all the required supplies, like a poultry feeder and waterer specifically designed for quail, a supplementary source of grit for their digestion, and bedding material. Additionally, buy high-quality starter feed formulated for quail chicks with the right protein content, vitamins, and minerals. 6. Bring the chicks home: Once you have everything set up, bring your quail chicks home, place them in the brooder, and begin monitoring them. Keep a check on the temperature, observe their behavior, and promptly address any health concerns. 7. Gradually acclimate the chicks to their permanent housing: After the chicks have outgrown the brooder, usually within 3-6 weeks, start introducing them to their permanent housing, whether it is a pen, coop, or aviary. Make sure the new environment is predator-proof, well-ventilated, and has suitable shelter and foraging space. 8. Maintain proper care and management: Continue providing your quail with fresh water, adequate and balanced nutrition, sanitary living conditions, and protection from extreme weather, predators, and diseases. Ensure vaccinations are up-to-date and seek veterinary assistance, if needed. 9. Join local communities or clubs: Engage with experienced quail breeders, keep learning new tips and tricks, and share your knowledge within the community to become successful in your endeavor to raise healthy and thriving quail. By diligently following these steps, you will successfully buy and raise quail chicks in your backyard while complying with local land laws and your neighbors' preferences. Raising quail might be a challenging experience, but with proper planning, knowledge, and dedication, it can be an enjoyable and rewarding venture."},{"instruction":"Here is a dialogue: Pearl: That's it! I'm buying a new car! Doug: It's about time. Pearl: My old hooptie is done for. What were they talking about?","output":"In the given dialogue, Pearl and Doug are discussing Pearl's decision to buy a new car. Pearl is evidently frustrated with her current vehicle, referred to as a \\"hooptie.\\" A hooptie is slang for an old, run-down, or unreliable car that is often associated with being cheap, having mechanical issues, or showing significant wear and tear. Pearl's decision to buy a new car probably stems from a series of inconvenient or negative experiences with her old car. It's likely that her old car has various mechanical problems or is simply too old to keep up with her needs, making it unsafe or inefficient to continue driving. Constant and costly repairs may have taken a toll on her financial resources and time, contributing to her decision to replace it. Doug, on the other hand, appears to be supportive of this decision, stating that \\"It's about time.\\" His response suggests that he has been aware of Pearl's struggles with her old car for a while now and recognizes the benefits of her getting a new one. It's possible that Doug had advised her to replace the old car before, and now that she's finally taking action, he's relieved. Pearl and Doug may have had previous discussions about the condition of her old car, such as sharing stories of breakdowns, repairs, or other related inconveniences it may have caused. This would have strengthened their shared understanding of the need to buy a new car. In summary, the dialogue between Pearl and Doug revolves around Pearl's old, run-down car and her decision to replace it. The deteriorating condition of her current vehicle and the issues it has caused appear to be the driving force behind her decision. Doug's supportive response reveals that he acknowledges the benefits of Pearl getting a new car and may have been advocating for this change to take place for some time."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: In what city does Jude meet Keenan Jones?

August and July are the driest months, and they’re less warm, so you have a lower incidence of mosquito bites,\\" he said. The Olympics are set to take place from Aug. 5 to 21 in Brazil’s second-largest city, followed by the Paralympic Games from Sept. 7 to 18. Tens of thousands of athletes and fans from every country on Earth will flood Rio in that time, only to return home potentially having been exposed to the Zika virus. It’s a scenario that might concern any epidemiologist. Even so, no \\"special preventive actions\\" like fogging with pesticides will be taken during or before the Olympic Games, Cristina Lemos, the city’s Health Department superintendent told Fox News Latino. \\"We will not direct our campaign at tourists,” she said. “We're just instructing them to use personal protection, like long-sleeved shirts, long pants and to avoid exposure to places that may have mosquitoes.” “And also to use insect repellent,\\" Lemos added. But many are skeptical of the city’s preparations. \\"We are counting on luck, we are counting on weather,” Brazilian biologist Mario Moscatelli told FNL. \\"The problem is that a city hosting an event like this should be taking actions to prevent the spread of disease, not depend on external factors.” He added that while it’s true that winters in Rio are relatively cooler and drier, “The mosquitos are still out there, and any change in weather – and we have seen extraordinary changes in these last months – could cause a disaster. The neighborhood where most of the competitions will take place is also where we have the highest concentration of Zika and dengue fever cases.\\" The numbers would seem to validate his concern. Since April 2015, more than 100,000 Brazilians have contracted the Zika virus – which has been linked to the increase of cases of microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads. Although summer ended two months ago, in May the country’s southeast region, where Rio is located, surpassed the northeast, where the epidemic began in 2015, in number of cases of Zika with 46,318, according to Brazil’s Health Ministry. The Zika virus is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito which also transmits dengue and yellow fever. The mosquito breeds in small pools of stagnant water that collect in and around residences, such as flower vases, buckets, old tires, even wet floors and in the tanks of toilets. Lemos, the health department official, said that the city has more than 3,000 agents deployed throughout the city to inspect places where Aedes mosquitoes are most abundant. They visit homes, she said, educating residents about how to protect themselves, “searching for water deposits that can become potential breeding sites … [and] treating with pesticide larval deposits that cannot be eliminated.” In extreme cases, she indicated, they would spray homes with insecticide. Lemos also said that squares, parks, clubs, parking lots, stadiums, vacant lots and other sites are being regularly inspected. But Moscatelli, with his expertise in biology, is not convinced. \\"We did almost nothing in the last 20 years to prevent the spread of Aedes. Seven years ago we were chosen to host the Olympics, which gave us a second chance, but nothing was done. What can we do in two months? Pray for the weather to behave. That’s it.\\" Carolina Torres is a freelance journalist living in Rio de Janeiro. Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The article discusses concerns in Rio de Janeiro regarding the potential outbreak of the Zika virus during the period of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, scheduled from August to September 2016. Rio de Janeiro's mayor, Eduardo Paes, disregards the chances of an outbreak by pointing out that the Games will take place during the driest months of July and August, when mosquitos are less active. Despite these claims, many people are skeptical about the city’s preparations for the international event. A significant influx of athletes and fans will be descending on the city, potentially exposing a global population to the virus. Even so, no special preventive measures such as fogging or pesticides are due, leaving visitors advised to take personal precautions against mosquitoes. Health Department superintendent, Cristina Lemos, identified that their campaign will not directly target tourists. Instead, the approach will revolve around advising personal protection, like wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants and using insect repellent. Additionally, efforts are being made to educate residents on mosquito prevention and eliminate potential breeding sites for the Aedes mosquito, which transmits the Zika, dengue, and yellow fever viruses. Biologist Mario Moscatelli is critical of the city's reliance on \\"luck\\" and \\"weather\\". He specifies that although winters are cooler and drier in Rio, mosquitoes are still present, and any extraordinary change in weather could lead to an outbreak. Particularly, Moscatelli raises concern over the neighborhood hosting most of the competitions as it also reports the highest concentration of Zika and dengue fever cases. The Zika virus has been a significant health issue in Brazil, with more than 100,000 cases since April 2015. It is linked to cases of microcephaly, a condition resulting in babies born with abnormally small heads. Despite the end of summer two months ago, as of May 2016, Rio has surpassing the northeast region where the epidemic began in the number of Zika cases. The criticisms against the lack of preventative measures are linked to the past 20 years of minimal action in controlling the Aedes mosquito. Despite winning the bid for the Olympics seven years ago and viewing it as an opportunity to increase disease control, critics argue that not much has been accomplished. The primary hope now is for favorable weather conditions to minimize the presence and activity of mosquitos."},{"instruction":"Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career.

The way we buy music, use our phones, operate our computers and so on. But the world has pretty much overlooked one of Apple’s greatest ideas yet: messages. The Times’s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry in his free, weekly e-mail newsletter. It started with iMessages, an iPhone/iPad app that lets you send text messages between Apple hand-held gadgets without cost. Instead of using the cellphone network (and paying 20 cents each or whatever), texts you send using this little app get sent across the Internet, costing you pretty much nothing. These Apple messages have many advantages over regular text messages. For example, the tiny word “received” appears beneath any message you send to let you know that your recipient’s gadget has received it. (If the recipient has turned on “Show read receipts” in Settings, you’ll even see the word “read” to let you know that the person has actually read the message.) If you’re in a back-and-forth conversation, the text messages show up on a single screen, scrolling up in conversation balloons like a chat session. While the other guy is typing, you see “…” in his balloon, so you know he’s working on a response and not just ignoring you. You can send pictures and videos through Messages. And you aren’t held to the usual 160-character limit of phone text messages. And if you have more than one iGadget — say, an iPhone and an iPad — you’ll find the same message threads on each one. You can pick up on a chat from wherever you left off on a different machine. Above all, Messages means that you can keep your text messages. They’re not locked onto your phone, like regular text messages. And they don’t scroll away forever, like regular text messages. You can go back and refer to them whenever, and they’re backed up every time you back up your device. So: Messages is cool. And coolly clever, the way it cuts the cellphone company out of the revenue stream. But that’s not the big news. Apple announced recently that this summer, it will release a new version of Mac OS X called Mountain Lion. And Mountain Lion will come with a new Mac app called Messages. You can download the beta version of Messages free, right now, even before Mountain Lion is available. (It’s actually just a beefed-up version of the previous iChat program, and still includes all of its audiochat and videochat features.) O.K., this is where things get crazy. Suddenly your computer and your phone are sharing the same communications stream. First, this means that you can now send text messages from your computer, using a full keyboard, which is a fairly radical change right there. You’ve been able to do that computer-to-phone trick before, but it’s been tricky. For years, I’ve been using Google Voice to send text messages for that very reason: on its Web page, I can send text messages, free, to phones, with the full comfort of mouse and keyboard. And you could sent text messages from chat programs — but only with special codes, and, of course, without the ability to resume the conversation on a different device. But Messages is the first time there’s been a low-friction, mass-available way to send computer-to-phone messages. The second huge change is that now you have your entire hard drive full of attachments — photos, videos, documents — to send to people’s phones. From your computer. Third, Messages preserves all of these exchanges, just as the iPhone did. But it’s far more useful to have your transcripts on the actual computer. Now you can archive them, search them, copy and paste them, print them, forward them and so on. Finally, Messages blurs the line between text messages, chats and e-mail. Or maybe it erases the line completely, and creates something entirely new. (One wild side effect: It gives birth to this frequently asked question: “Are you on the phone or the Mac?” For the first time, there’s no way to know. You can’t tell if someone’s being terse because she’s tapping out her responses with one finger on glass, or because she’s on her computer but just distracted.) Messages is in beta testing, so there are some kinks to work out. They’re actually kind of cool: side effects of the disruptive Messages change. For example, when I’m conducting a chat on my Mac, the iPhone in my pocket goes nuts, vibrating or dinging madly with each line. Remember, the phone believes that each line of the chat is an incoming text message. Sure, I could go into Settings and turn off the ringing and vibrating — but that’s a lot of trouble every time I start or stop chatting on the Mac. Similarly, a number of times, I’ve had this bizarre situation: I’ve conducted a chat during an airplane ride on the laptop. Then, when I land and turn my phone back on, it’s tied up for seven minutes, furiously downloading all of those “text messages” that happened while it was asleep, frantically vibrating or dinging. I mean, this is logical. It’s what Messages is supposed to do: sync the phone, tablet, Touch, and Mac. But there should be a setting somewhere: “Don’t alert me when downloading messages I’ve already read.” There are also some bugs, including some creepy sequencing errors. I’ve seen text messages appear chronologically in the wrong place in the Mac transcript, for example. Even among Mac-to-Mac chats, I’ve sometimes seen messages appear too soon in the transcript. Finally, I don’t know if I’m typical, but I had some trouble getting started. You have to have an iCloud account (it’s free) to make the syncing work between devices, and somehow I had to enter the proper e-mail address in the phone’s Settings before everything worked. I hope Apple gets around to solving these glitches. In the meantime, Messages will be changing the lives of heavy texters everywhere. Phones, tablets, Touches and computers are now all equal citizens in the world of short typed communications. Photos, videos and documents can now be part of computer-to-phone correspondence. Your dialogue can be archived and preserved forever. In other words, for heavy communicators, the one small modification Apple has made to the rules has changed the game completely. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a really cool thing that Apple made called iMessage. You know how you send texts to your friends from your phone? Well, iMessage lets you do that from other Apple things like your iPad or even your computer, and it's free! You can even send pictures and videos without worrying about a character limit like normal text messages. And the best part? You can see your conversations on all your Apple stuff. So if you text on your iPad and then move to your computer, you can pick up right where you left off! This makes it really easy to keep all your messages and look at them whenever you want.

Article: One of the worst feelings you have as a professional athlete is the feeling after losing a game to a team that you should have beaten. That happened last night against the lowly Boston Celtics. They had only won 13 games the whole year and were really struggling. We had just come off a very good win against the Orlando Magic on the road and were feeling good about ourselves. The day did not start out good for us when we learned that T-Mac was going to miss the game with the flu. When you lose your best players (Yao, T-Mac) everyone must play a little harder and do a little bit more on the floor. We inserted Bonzi Wells into the lineup (he was the only one to have a good game for us), in place of T-Mac. It was a nasty game. We are usually one of the best three point shooting teams in the NBA and we only made 1 of 22 three point shots! I have never seen that happen. Never! Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious. In the locker room after the game, everybody felt terrible. When we play a bad game, we feel that we let our teammates down.

This level of education is known to provide specialized or advanced knowledge and skills, which facilitates workforce development and significantly contributes to the overall growth of a nation. Many people continuously seek access to tertiary institutions as a means of engaging in advanced learning, undertaking research, acquiring professional qualifications, or expanding their career opportunities. The number of tertiary schools across the world has been growing steadily, reflecting the rising demand for higher education. This article focuses on providing a detailed overview of the number of tertiary institutions as of 2013, highlighting both global and regional contexts. Global Overview of Tertiary Institutions in 2013 As of 2013, it is estimated that there were around 34,000 tertiary institutions worldwide. This figure, however, greatly varies from one region to another, with some regions having considerably more tertiary schools than others. Data from a UNESCO report suggests that the number of higher education institutions expanded by more than 31% between 2000 and 2013, illustrating the growing emphasis placed on tertiary education by many countries. Regional Overview: Number of Tertiary Institutions in 2013 1. North America: North America, especially the United States, is renowned for its thriving higher education sector. In the US alone, there were approximately 4,726 degree-granting institutions as of 2013. North America had over 8,000 tertiary institutions during this period, indicating its pivotal role in shaping the global landscape of higher education. 2. Europe: Europe is another region with a considerable number of tertiary institutions. As of 2013, Europe boasted approximately 7,000 tertiary schools, which include diverse categories such as professional schools, vocational institutions, and universities. These figures reflect the range and scale of tertiary education options available throughout Europe. 3. Asia: As the largest and most populous continent, Asia is experiencing immense growth in the number of its tertiary institutions. As of 2013, Asia was home to around 13,000 tertiary institutions, with China and India accounting for a substantial portion of these schools. The rapid expansion of tertiary education in Asia can be attributed to factors such as the increasing role of Asian countries in the global economy and the rising demand for skilled labor within the region. 4. Latin America and the Caribbean: The number of tertiary institutions within this region was approximately 4,000 in 2013, reflecting growing demand for higher education in countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. 5. Africa: Despite having the lowest number of tertiary institutions in comparison to other regions, Africa has witnessed encouraging growth in recent years. The number of tertiary institutions in Africa in 2013 was almost 1,700, highlighting the region's commitment to addressing socio-economic and development challenges through the expansion of higher education opportunities. Conclusion As of 2013, the world hosted around 34,000 tertiary institutions. While some regions, such as North America and Europe, demonstrated well-established higher education systems, others like Asia, Latin America, and Africa displayed more recent yet promising expansion. The considerable growth in the number of tertiary institutions since the beginning of the 21st century demonstrates the world's strong commitment to furthering education and professional opportunities on an international scale. It is essential to continually monitor the state of tertiary education and address the emerging challenges to ensure the continued development and success of learners, educators, and communities worldwide."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The , sometimes translated as The Chronicles of Japan, is the second oldest book of classical Japanese history.

The boards of the covers, previously assumed to be limewood, are now thought to be birch, an unusual wood in later bindings, but one easily available in northern England. Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes. The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through, at the four corners of the two main frames, and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif.The stitching of the binding uses \\"Coptic sewing\\", that is \\"flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)\\" Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. The first appearance of the cords or supports that these \\"unsupported\\" bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"helping others makes John feel shameful\\" - Sentence B: \\"committing perjury makes John feel shameful\\" Let's reason step by step:","output":"To determine which sentence is against common sense, let's analyze each sentence and the emotions associated with them. Sentence A: \\"Helping others makes John feel shameful.\\" Reasoning: Generally, helping others is considered a positive and moral action that brings about feelings of happiness, pride, or satisfaction. Feeling shameful for helping others goes against what is typically expected as it implies that John feels guilt or embarrassment for doing something good or helpful. Sentence B: \\"Committing perjury makes John feel shameful.\\" Reasoning: Committing perjury (lying under oath) is considered an immoral and illegal action. It's natural for someone to feel shameful after committing perjury since it involves deception and dishonesty, which goes against commonly accepted ethical principles. Upon analyzing both sentences, Sentence A (\\"helping others makes John feel shameful\\") is against common sense as it implies a negative emotional response to an action that is generally considered positive and ethical. Sentence B, on the other hand, is consistent with what one might expect in response to an immoral action like perjury."},{"instruction":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Awesome book Review: I purchased this item for my son who has been a Pink Flyod/Waters fan since high school.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner Movie plot: \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" begins with Colin Smith (Tom Courtenay) running, alone, along a bleak country road somewhere in rural England. In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by \\"The Governor\\" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation program.As the Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences, we learn in a series of flashbacks how Colin came to be incarcerated. We see his difficult, economically strained family life in a lower-class workers' complex in industrial Nottingham. Without a job, Colin indulges in petty crimes in the company of his best friend, Mike (James Bolam).

Step 1: Research I will start by searching the internet for academic articles and studies that discuss the reasons for delayed graduation for students from Northeastern University and US universities in general. I will also explore official websites of these institutions to access their reports on the subject. Step 2: Identify common reasons From the research, I will identify the most commonly cited reasons for delayed graduation from Northeastern and US universities. These reasons might include, but are not limited to, financial issues, change of major, coursework difficulty, personal or family issues, internships or co-op programs and transferring between schools. Step 3: Comparison I will compare the reasons identified for Northeastern University and US universities in general. This will help understand if there are any significant differences between the two. Step 4: Answering the questions With the information gathered, I will provide the main reasons why students from Northeastern University don't graduate on time, and why students from universities in the US might struggle to graduate on time. As for the third question, the two questions are related but not exactly the same. The first question specifically addresses the reasons why students from Northeastern University might not graduate on time, while the second question is about universities in the US in general. However, the factors identified in both cases could be similar. The reasons for the first question will be a subset or specific variation of the reasons for the second question."},{"instruction":"Where would I put a rosebush if I did not have any containers to store it in? Options: - flower garden - garden center - pot - pot - formal garden Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"1. Evaluate the given options to determine if they are suitable for storing a rosebush without a container. 2. Eliminate options that involve using a container, such as \\"pot,\\" since the user stated they don't have any containers. 3. Consider the remaining options and identify which is most suitable for planting a rosebush without a container. Evaluation: - Flower garden: A flower garden is an excellent location to plant a rosebush, as it does not require a container. - Garden center: A garden center is a place to buy plants and gardening supplies, not a location to store a rosebush without a container. - Pot: Eliminate these two options, as the user doesn't have any containers. - Formal garden: A formal garden is another suitable location to plant a rosebush without a container, as long as the user has access to one.

Usually this kind of feeling doesn't last long. School is a fact of life and getting a good education can help you build the kind of future life you want. So let's talk about school and what to do when you don't like it. The first step is to find out why. You might not like school because you don't have enough friends, or maybe you don't get along with your teachers. Sometimes it's a big problem with your classes and school work. You may be getting further and further behind, and it may seem like you'll never catch up. When you know why you don't like school, you can start taking steps to make things better. It's a good idea to talk to someone about your problems with school. Your mom, dad, or teachers will be able to help you. Another good idea is to write down your feelings about school in a notebook. It's a great way to let out emotion . Remember, you don't have to share what you've written with others. And here are some ways to give you the best first day of school. The night before school starts, you can do something quiet and peaceful to calm yourself down, like reading a book with your parents, taking a walk or taking a photo of your smiling face. By doing these, you will have a nice day at school. Question: This passage can probably be seen _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"in a student's guide book\\"?

After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would France have lower or higher labor supply? A:","output":"A: Given the information in the paragraph, it can be inferred that France would likely have a lower labor supply in comparison to Germany. The reasoning behind this inference is that France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate, which is often associated with pro-socialist governments. This higher tax rate potentially discourages businesses and individuals from expanding or investing in labor, resulting in a lower labor supply. On the other hand, Germany's pro-capitalist governments led to them implementing a tax rate below the critical rate, which would encourage businesses to expand their operations and invest in labor, leading to a higher labor supply compared to France."},{"instruction":"Choose from: [I] fungi.

The population density is 6,859.8 people per square mile (2,648.6/km²). There are 52,941 housing units at an average density of 2,808.5 per square mile (1,084.4/km²). The racial makeup of the city is 42.6% White, 35.4% African American, 0.5% Native American, 4.6% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 12.9% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 27.4% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 31.8% of the population in 2010, down from 69.6% in 1970. The city's demography is shifting rapidly: New Haven has always been a city of immigrants and currently the Latino population is growing rapidly. Previous influxes among ethnic groups have been African-Americans in the postwar era, and Irish, Italian and (to a lesser degree) Slavic peoples in the prewar period. Now answer this question: New Haven has a large immigrant population, what seems to be one of the main cause of it throughout the last century?","output":"New Haven's large immigrant population can be attributed to several factors throughout the last century, including its location, industry, and a historical precedent of being a welcoming city for various ethnic groups. As illustrated in the article, New Haven has consistently experienced influxes among different ethnic populations over time. One of the main reasons for this is New Haven's geographical location as a port city on the East Coast of the United States. As a result, it has been an entry point for immigrants arriving from Europe, Africa, and, more recently, Latin America. The harbor and proximity to other major cities like New York and Boston provide increased opportunities for trade, transportation, and employment, making New Haven an attractive destination for immigrants seeking a better life. Another contributing factor is the growth of industry in New Haven during the early and mid-20th century. The city's industrial development included the manufacturing of firearms, carriages, hardware, and clocks. This expansion attracted immigrants looking for work, especially Irish, Italian, and Slavic populations during the prewar period, as well as African Americans during the postwar period. Furthermore, New Haven's diverse heritage has created a community known for its tolerance and openness to different cultures over the years. This welcoming atmosphere has not only led to the establishment of strong ethnic communities within the city but has also made the city an ideal destination for new immigrants seeking a supportive environment. This historical precedent is evident in the growing Latino population, which now makes up a sizable portion of the city's demographic composition. In summary, New Haven's large immigrant population can be attributed to a combination of its geographical location, industrial growth throughout the last century, and its reputation as a city that embraces different cultures and ethnicities. These factors have allowed for a dynamic and continually evolving mix of immigrant populations within the city of New Haven."},{"instruction":"What happens next in this paragraph?

In Waters' absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \\"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\\". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. He experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\".

I typically don't enjoy penning negative reviews, but my experience at this establishment has compelled me to share my thoughts to perhaps caution future patrons. I recently had the absolute misfortune of dining at this restaurant, an experience that was unquestionably marred by poor service, substandard food quality, and a distinct lack of ambience. Arriving at the restaurant, we were greeted, or should I say ignored, by two disinterested hostesses engaged in what seemed to be a far more engrossing conversation among themselves, leaving us feeling unwelcome right from the outset. Their behavior was not reflective of the warm and friendly service one would expect when dining out. The nippy reception and lethargic service were the first indications of the arduous dinner experience we were about to ensue. Navigating towards our tables was akin to maneuvering through a maze, largely due to the overcrowded layout of the restaurant. The acoustics was another concern, as the deafening chatter and noise level necessitated nearly shouting across the table to conduct a conversation, thus dramatically reducing the dining enjoyment. As for the waitstaff, they appeared to be woefully ill-prepared to handle the number of guests, a fact that manifested as long waiting durations and orders gone awry. Despite the noticeably slow night, we waited an unbearable 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive, and an additional hour for the food - an appalling standard of service for any dining establishment. When the food finally made an appearance, it was clear that the kitchen staff had followed suit in the apparent race to underperform. The lobster bisque was insipid, lacking the depth and rich flavor one would associate with such a delicacy. The roast chicken was regrettably overcooked and dry, accompanied by wilted greens that crunched unpleasantly under your teeth. The steak, which was ordered as medium-rare, arrived well-done and was so tough it was a challenge to even cut through. As the evening progressed, the discomfort was worsened by a blaring music choice that seemed wildly out of sync with the restaurant’s claimed “fine dining experience.” This element only further contributed to an already chaotic atmosphere rather than enhancing it. Throughout the evening, there was no effort shown by the management to address any of these issues that were clearly having a significant, negative impact on our dining experience. The lack of ownership or even an initiative to offer any basic amenities or complimentary services to make up for the glaring lapses was disappointing, to say the least. In conclusion, while I believe every restaurant can have an off-night, what I experienced seemed to be a standard operating procedure rather than an exception. There's a lot to be said for living up to your advertising, and from my experience, this venue clearly falls short of its lofty claims. A restaurant's primary role is to provide a delightful dining experience for patrons, which includes quality food, good ambiance, and impeccable service. Regrettably, in my opinion, this restaurant failed on all fronts. I’m afraid I cannot recommend this place and would caution others about dining here. For now, I will definitely be taking my business to more deserving establishments."},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: Strong support from young and minority voters propelled Barack Obama on the road to the White House, exit polls showed Tuesday. Students wait in a long line to vote Tuesday on the campus of the University of Central Florida. Voters in the 18 to 24 age group broke 68 percent for Obama to 30 percent for John McCain, according to the exit polling. Those in the 25 to 29 age bracket went 69 percent to 29 percent in Obama's favor. The only age group where McCain prevailed was 65 and over, and that by just a 10-percentage-point margin, 54 percent to 44 percent, the exit polls showed. And minorities went heavily into the Obama camp. Blacks, 96 percent Obama to 3 percent McCain; Latinos, 67 percent Obama to 30 percent McCain; and Asians, 63 percent Obama to 34 percent McCain. Obama did well with Latinos because they appear to disapprove of President Bush's job performance more than the rest of the country, CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said. Watch CNN's Bill Schneider explain the Latino impact ». About 80 percent of Latinos give Bush negative marks, while 72 percent of all Americans do, exit polling showed. Race played less of a role in the election than age, exit polls showed. While Obama is projected to be the nation's first black president, John McCain would have been the oldest person ever elected to the nation's highest office. Twice as many of those polled Tuesday said age was an important factor in their vote as those who said race was. Among those factoring age into their vote, 78 percent went for Obama to 21 percent for McCain, exit polls showed. Those who said race was an important factor voted 55 percent to 44 percent in favor of Obama. But Obama also was the winner by a similar margin among those who said race was not important, \\"which suggests that race was not a decisive factor in this election,\\" Schneider said. The economy was the top issue in the election among 62 percent of voters questioned in exit polls on Tuesday. It was far ahead of the second-place issue, the Iraq war, which was named as the top concern of 10 percent of voters polled. Those who picked the Iraq war as their top issue mostly voted for Obama in all but two states, according to the early exit polling results. Health care and terrorism were tied at 9 percent as the issue voters were most concerned about, according to the exit polling. Those who picked terrorism as their top concern overwhelmingly choose McCain, according to exit polling. In early exit polling, first-time voters were breaking overwhelmingly for Obama over McCain by a 72 percent to 27 percent margin. Watch what first-time voters had to say in Florida ». High income voters -- those who said they make at least 100,000 a year -- went in Obama's favor, 52 percent to 47 percent. Many of those polled said they expect a post-election tax increase, with 49 percent predicting their taxes will rise no matter who is elected president. Another 22 percent said taxes will go up only if Obama wins, and 12 percent said taxes will go up only if McCain wins. Only 15 percent said their taxes will stay the same or go down. A bare majority of those surveyed -- 51 percent -- think the government should do more to solve problems. Forty-three percent believe the government is doing too much. At the same time, early exit polling shows only a minority of voters -- 40 percent -- support the 700 billion government plan to assist failing financial companies. Fifty-six percent are opposed. Watch CNN's Bill Schneider explain how the economy dominated voter concerns ». GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin didn't do well in exit polls. Sixty percent of those polled said the Alaska governor is not qualified to be president if necessary; 38 percent said she is. That compares with the two-thirds of those polled who said Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden is qualified to be president and the 31 percent who said he isn't. Watch CNN's Jack Cafferty ask what issue is most important ». Many voters told the pollsters that they made up their minds early in the campaign season, with 61 percent saying they made up their minds before September, another 13 percent saying they decided in September and 17 percent saying they made their selection last month. Only 7 percent of those polled decided whom to support within the last three days. Exit polling also showed that Democrats who supported Sen. Hillary Clinton during the primaries overwhelming voted for Obama in the general election, 84 percent to 15 percent for McCain. For the poll, more than 16,000 people who had just voted were selected at random to fill out questionnaires. CNN's Joe Von Kanel and Hal Quinley contributed to this report. Highlights:","output":"1. Many young and minority voters supported Barack Obama, helping him become President. 2. People aged 18 to 29 voted more for Obama than for John McCain, while those over 65 voted more for McCain. 3.

Examples of taxonomic ranks are species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain, etc. - A twig is a small thin terminal branch of a woody plant. The buds on the twig are an important diagnostic characteristic, as are the abscission scars where the leaves have fallen away. The color, texture, and patterning of the twig bark are also important, in addition to the thickness and nature of any pith of the twig. - Seaweed refers to several species of macroscopic, multicellular, marine algae. - A zygote (from Greek \\"zygtos\\" \\"joined\\" or \\"yoked\\", from \\"zygoun\\" \\"to join\\" or \\"to yoke\\"), is a eukaryotic cell formed by a fertilization event between two gametes. The zygote's genome is a combination of the DNA in each gamete, and contains all of the genetic information necessary to form a new individual. In multicellular organisms, the zygote is the earliest developmental stage. In single-celled organisms, the zygote can divide asexually by mitosis to produce identical offspring. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: , - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race + - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes. - Ecdysozoa is a group of protostome animals, including Arthropoda (insects, chelicerata, crustaceans, and myriapods), nematoda, and several smaller phyla. They were first defined by Aguinaldo \\"et al.\\" in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees constructed using 18S ribosomal RNA genes. A large study in 2008 by Dunn \\"et al.\\" strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants. - A lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae and/or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi in a symbiotic relationship. The combined life form has properties that are very different from the properties of its component organisms. Lichens come in many colours, sizes, and forms. The properties are sometimes plant-like, but lichens are not plants. Lichens may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose), flat leaf-like structures (foliose), flakes that lie on the surface like peeling paint (crustose), or other growth forms. A macrolichen is a lichen that is either bush-like or leafy; all other lichens are termed microlichens. Here, \\"macro\\" and \\"micro\\" do not refer to size, but to the growth form. Common names for lichens may contain the word \\"moss\\" (e.g., \\"Reindeer moss\\", \\"Iceland moss\\"), and lichens may superficially look like and grow with mosses, but lichens are not related to mosses or any plant. Lichens do not have roots that absorb water and nutrients as plants do but like plants they produce their own food by photosynthesis using solar energy, from carbon dioxide, water and minerals in their environment. When they grow on plants, they do not live as parasites but instead use the plants as a substrate. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts. - Sponges are the basalmost clade of animals of the phylum Porifera (meaning \\"pore bearer\\". They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. Sponges have unspecialized cells that can transform into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes. Overview. Sponges are similar to other animals in that they are multicellular, heterotrophic, lack cell walls and produce sperm cells. Unlike other animals, they lack true tissues and organs, and have no body symmetry. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the osculum. Many sponges have internal skeletons of spongin and/or spicules of calcium carbonate or silicon dioxide. All sponges are sessile aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding . - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells, each genetically distinct from the parent cell that gave rise to them. This process occurs in all sexually reproducing single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi. Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy are the leading known cause of miscarriage and the most frequent genetic cause of developmental disabilities. - Members of the Monoblepharidomycetes have a filamentous thallus that is either extensive or simple and unbranched . They frequently have a holdfast at the base . In contrast to other taxa in their phylum , some reproduce using autospores , although many do so through zoospores . Oogamous sexual reproduction may also occur . In addition to the type genus , the order Monoblepharidales includes Harpochytrium and Oedogoniomyces . - Myxogastria/Myxogastrea (myxogastrids, ICZN) or Myxomycetes (ICBN), is a grouping of slime molds that contains 5 orders, 14 families, 62 genera and 888 species. They are colloquially known as the plasmodial or acellular slime moulds. - Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis), and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). Meiosis results in twelve haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions: homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the second division. Both of these cell division cycles are used in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle, and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission, where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication. - Thallus (plural: thalli), from Latinized Greek (\\"thallos\\"), meaning \\"a green shoot\\" or \\"twig,\\" is the undifferentiated vegetative tissue of some organisms in diverse groups such as algae, fungi, some liverworts, lichens, and the Myxogastria. Many of these organisms were previously known as the thallophytes, a polyphyletic group of distantly related organisms. An organism or structure resembling a thallus is called thalloid, thallodal, thalliform, thalline, or thallose. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy). - Crinoids are marine animals that make up the class Crinoidea of the echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata). The name comes from the Greek word \\"krinon\\", \\"a lily\\", and \\"eidos\\", \\"form\\". They live in both shallow water and in depths as great as . Those crinoids which, in their adult form, are attached to the sea bottom by a stalk are commonly called sea lilies. The unstalked forms are called feather stars or comatulids. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word () \\"sperma\\" (meaning \\"seed\\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \\"male\\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis. It is also possible to extract sperm through TESE. Some sperm banks hold up to of sperm. - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - A holdfast is a root-like structure that anchors aquatic sessile organisms, such as seaweed, other sessile algae, stalked crinoids, benthic cnidarians, and sponges, to the substrate. - The thallophytes (Thallophyta or Thallobionta) are a polyphyletic group of non-mobile organisms traditionally described as \\"thalloid plants\\", \\"relatively simple plants\\" or \\"lower plants\\". They were a defunct division of kingdom Plantae that included fungus, lichens and algae and occasionally bryophytes, bacteria and the Myxomycota. Thallophytes have a hidden reproductive system and hence they are also called Cryptogamae (together with ferns), as opposed to Phanerogamae. The thallophytes are defined as having undifferentiated bodies (thalli), as opposed to cormophytes (Cormophyta) with roots and stems. - A gamete (from Ancient Greek \\"gamete\\" from gamein \\"to marry\\") is a cell that fuses with another cell during fertilization (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gametecalled an ovum (or egg)and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like typecalled a sperm. This is an example of anisogamy or heterogamy, the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell). In contrast, isogamy is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for mating type. The name gamete was introduced by the Austrian biologist Gregor Mendel. Gametes carry half the genetic information of an individual, one ploidy of each type, and are created through meiosis. - The plural (abbreviated ), in many languages, is one of the values of the grammatical category of number. Plural of nouns typically denote a quantity other than the default quantity represented by a noun, which is generally one (the form that represents this default quantity is said to be of \\"singular\\" number). Most commonly, therefore, plurals are used to denote two or more of something, although they may also denote more than fractional, zero or negative amounts. An example of a plural is the English word \\"cats\\", which corresponds to the singular \\"cat\\". What entity does 'monoblepharidomycetes' has the relation 'taxon rank' with?

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century. He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it alienated many Francophones. - Charles Joseph \\"Joe\\" Clark, (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian statesman, businessman, writer, and politician who served as the 16th Prime Minister of Canada, from June 4, 1979, to March 3, 1980. - Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (; October 18, 1919 September 28, 2000), better known as Pierre Trudeau or Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from 19681979 and 19801984. He is the 3rd longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald), having served for 15 years, 164 days. - The Conservative Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Tories, is a political party in Canada. It is positioned on the right of the Canadian political spectrum. The party's leader from 2004 to 2015 was Stephen Harper, who served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015. - The Liberal Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Grits, is the oldest federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum. The Liberal Party is traditionally positioned to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party (NDP). - The Canadian federal election of 1979 was held on May 22 , 1979 to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 31st Parliament of Canada . It resulted in the defeat of the Liberal Party of Canada after 11 years in power under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . Joe Clark led the Progressive Conservative Party to power , but with only a minority of seats in the House of Commons . The Liberals , however , did beat the Progressive Conservatives in the overall popular vote by more than 400,000 votes . - William Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874 July 22, 1950) was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \\"Help those that cannot help themselves\\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state. - The New Democratic Party (NDP NPD) is a social-democratic political party in Canada. The leader of the federal wing of the NDP is Thomas Mulcair, who was elected in the 2012 leadership election, led the party through the 2015 federal election and then lost a party leadership review on April 10, 2016. Mulcair will remain as leader, until his replacement is chosen at a leadership election to be held in 2017. What is the relationship between 'canadian federal election' and 'prime minister of canada'? A:","output":"The relationship between the Canadian federal election and the Prime Minister of Canada is that the Canadian federal election determines the composition of the House of Commons, which in turn influences the selection of the Prime Minister. During a federal election, Canadians vote for Members of Parliament (MPs) to represent their electoral districts in the House of Commons. The leader of the party that holds the majority of seats or is able to form a coalition or secure the confidence of the House of Commons usually becomes the Prime Minister of Canada. The Prime Minister serves as the head of government and leads the ruling party or coalition."},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

However, if you convince yourself beforehand that the pain won't be so bad, you might not suffer as much. According to a recent study, the part of your brain that reacts to severe pain is largely the same part that reacts to expectation of pain. Researchers in this study worked with 10 volunteers, aged 24 to 46. Each volunteer wore a device that gave out 20-second-long pulses of heat to the right leg. There were three levels of heat, producing mild, moderate, or strong pain. During training, the volunteers would first hear a tone, followed by a period of silence, and then feel a heat pulse. They then learned to associate the length of the silent pause with the intensity of the upcoming heat pulse. The longer the pause, the stronger the heat pulse would be, causing more severe pain. A day or two later, the real experiment began. The researchers found that the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, emotion, and touch became more active as the volunteers expected higher levels of pain. These were mainly the same areas that became active when participants actually felt pain. Interestingly, when the volunteers expected only mild or moderate pain but experienced severe pain, they reported feeling 28 percent less pain than when they expected severe pain and actually got it. The new study emphasizes that pain has both physical and psychological elements.

A detailed analysis is given below: Positive: The phrase \\"a bracing, unblinking work\\" implies a harsh, yet straightforward piece of work. This could be construed as a positive remark, in that it doesn't shy away from hard truth or the reality, instead, it displays a sense of bravery and audacity. Bracing denotes invigorating or stimulating, meaning it engages the viewer or reader intellectually or emotionally. The term \\"unblinking\\" refers to the notion that the work isn't trying to hide its truths despite the fact they might be harsh to appreciate. It could also be seen as positively influential, possibly inspiring the audience to face challenging realities or truths head-on, or inciting beneficial change. Negative: On the contrary, the phrase can be seen as negative when considering the terms \\"painful elegy\\" and \\"sobering cautionary tale\\". The word \\"painful\\" here shows that the work is emotionally heavy or sad, suggesting the presence of sorrow or melancholic themes. An 'elegy' typically implies a mournful, melancholic poem or other pieces of writing, suggesting a sense of loss or grief. \\"Sobering cautionary tale\\" carries a negative connotation, hinting that the work serves as a warning about a somber or serious issue. This indicates that the content could be alarming or distressing, underlining the negative aspects of the statement. In this case, the positive or negative understanding of the phrase depends largely on personal perspectives and individual interpretations of whether candid realism (present in \\"a bracing, unblinking work\\") is more valuable than the emotional toll (portrayed through \\"painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale\\") it might take on the audience. It's a strong blend of both sentiments which makes literary criticism so subjective and diverse. Given the context, this phrase can be perceived in more ways than one since it appreciates the unapologetic approach of the work but also underscores its potentially gloomy or upsetting content."},{"instruction":"Seeing that Taylor was feeling lost and alone, Tracy saved Taylor's soul.

Question: suppose the water becomes more cold happens, how will it affect more water droplets will be absorbed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"A: more When the water in the clouds becomes colder, it will have a greater capacity to absorb more water droplets due to the following reasons: 1. Lower temperatures promote the growth of ice crystals: When the temperature of the water in the clouds decreases, the rate at which it freezes increases. This leads to the formation of ice crystals which grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets. The colder the water, the more efficiently the ice crystals grow. As a result, the ice crystals will absorb more water droplets when the water's temperature is colder. 2. Lower saturation vapor pressure at lower temperatures: The saturation vapor pressure of water decreases at lower temperatures. This means that at colder temperatures, the air can hold less water vapor before becoming saturated. When the temperature of the water drops, the surrounding air will become saturated more easily, leading to a higher relative humidity near the ice crystals. This increased humidity will lead to a higher rate of water droplet absorption by the ice crystals. 3. Increased density of air at lower temperatures: At lower temperatures, the density of air generally increases. This results in a higher concentration of water droplets within the same volume of air, making it more likely for the ice crystals to come into contact with them. As a result, the ice crystals will absorb more water droplets when the water is colder. 4. More efficient snowflake formation: The colder the water in the clouds, the faster the ice crystals can combine to form snowflakes. These snowflakes become more effective at absorbing additional water droplets as they grow larger due to their increased surface area. This leads to a higher rate of water droplet absorption by the snowflakes in colder conditions. In conclusion, when the water in the clouds becomes colder, it is more likely to absorb a higher number of water droplets due to factors such as faster ice crystal growth, lower saturation vapor pressure, increased air density, and more efficient snowflake formation. This results in more water droplets being absorbed by the ice crystals and eventual precipitation as snow."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Answer the question below: If a product is unstretched, elastic force will increase or decrease?

This naming occurred after the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660. Prior to the Restoration, Oliver Cromwell had granted the English East India Company a charter to govern Saint Helena in 1657. The purpose of this decision was to fortify the island and establish it as a colony with planters. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, making Saint Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. Consequently, a fort and several houses were built on the island. After the monarchy's restoration, the East India Company received a royal charter, which granted them the exclusive right to fortify and colonise the island. To honor the Duke of York, who later became James II of England, the fort was renamed James Fort, and the town was named Jamestown. This was done as a show of respect and recognition for the royal family and the Duke's status within it, as well as to solidify the connection between the English monarchy and the governance of the island. As a result, Saint Helena became an important strategic outpost for British trade during the Age of Exploration. Its location in the South Atlantic allowed the island to serve as a crucial stopover point for British ships traveling to and from the East Indies. The presence of Jamestown and James Fort showcased the influence of the English East India Company and the British Crown, both of which played a significant role in the administration of the island and its integration into the network of British colonies.

They organize themselves into groups with very specific tasks: foraging for food, defending against predators, building tunnels, etc. An enormous amount of coordination and communication is required to accomplish this. To explore the evolutionary roots of the remarkable system, researchers at The Rockefeller University have created the first genetically altered ants, modifying a gene essential for sensing the pheromones that ants use to communicate. The result, severe deficiencies in the ants' social behaviors and their ability to survive within a colony, both sheds light on a key facet of social evolution and demonstrates the feasibility and utility of genome editing in ants. \\"It was well known that ant language is produced through pheromones, but now we understand a lot more about how pheromones are perceived,\\" says Daniel Kronauer, head of the Laboratory of Social Evolution and Behavior. \\"The way ants interact is fundamentally different from how solitary organisms interact, and with these findings we know a bit more about the genetic evolution that enabled ants to create structured societies.\\" Social beginnings The most important class of pheromones in ant communication are hydrocarbons, which can communicate species, colony, and caste identity as well as reproductive status. These pheromone signals are detected by porous sensory hairs on the ants' antennae that contain what are called odorant receptors -- proteins that recognize specific chemicals and pass the signal up to the brain. Work in the Kronauer lab, led by graduate student Sean McKenzie and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has shown that a group of odorant receptor genes, known as 9-exon-alpha ORs, are responsible for sensing hydrocarbons in the clonal raider ant species Ooceraea biroi. McKenzie and his colleagues also examined the genomes of related insects to determine where 9-exon ORs emerged in the evolution of this species, and found that there was an enormous duplication in this gene in a relatively short evolutionary timescale: While the ancestors of bees and ants only had one to three copies of this gene, clonal raider ants have about 180 copies. The massive expansion of 9-exon ORs happened concurrently with the evolution of complex social behavior, suggesting that the duplication of odorant receptor genes was vital to the development of ant communication. Communication interrupted To further dissect the role of odorant receptors in ant communication and social behavior, the Kronauer lab disrupted a gene called orco, required for the function of all odorant receptors. Introducing the mutation -- using a genetic manipulation technique known as CRISPR -- was easy. The challenge was keeping the mutant ants alive. \\"We had to convince the colonies to accept the mutants. If the conditions weren't right, the worker ants would stop caring for larvae and destroy them,\\" says graduate fellow Waring Trible, who led this portion of the study, published separately in Cell. \\"Once the ants successfully made it to the adult phase, we noticed a shift in their behavior almost immediately.\\" Ants typically travel single-file, sensing the route by detecting pheromones left by the ants in front. Using an automated system that tracks color-coded ants and an algorithm that analyzes movement, the researchers observed that, among other behavioral abnormalities, the mutant ants couldn't fall in line. The finding suggests that the missing odorant receptors are crucial for pheromone detection, and therefore social organization. The lack of odorant receptors also changed the shape of the ants' brains. This was a surprise, says Trible, \\"because brain anatomy is not affected in orco mutants in other insects, like the fruit fly. Our findings suggest that ants are fundamentally different -- they need functional odorant receptors for the brain to develop correctly. This points to how crucial sensing odors is to ants, an ability that may be less important in other insects. \\" Now that the lab is able to generate mutant ants, Kronauer has a bucket list of genes to explore, including those related to the division of labor between groups. \\"We've successfully taken a gene out, and next we'd like to put a gene in. We have a whole new world to explore,\\" says Kronauer. ||||| Two independent research teams at New York University and Rockefeller University say they have genetically modified two different species of ants. Here's some of what they found. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Despite what you might've seen in 1950s monster movies, it's difficult to raise mutant ants. For years biologists have altered the genetics of organisms as varied as mice and rice. Mutant fruit flies are a laboratory staple. But ants' complex life cycle hampered efforts to grow genetically engineered ants — until now. On Thursday, two independent research teams described their work deleting ant genes. Two papers chronicling the first mutant ants appeared in the journal Cell, along with a third study that altered ant behavior using an insect brain hormone. Claude Desplan, a New York University biologist and an author of one of the studies, said that, as far as he could tell, these ants are “the first mutant in any social insect.” Ants have complex social roles, even though members of a colony are genetically very similar. Females may be egg-laying queens or sterile workers, colony cleaners or fierce soldiers. Males, who are little more than sperm-delivery systems with wings, appear only seasonally. To ensure the mutant genes carry on, “you need to go through the queen,” Desplan said. “It is not so easy to make queens.” “There's a lot of interesting biologic questions that you can study with ants that you can’t study with fruit flies or even mice,” said Rockefeller University biologist Daniel Kronauer, an author of the other mutant-ant study. If you throw a thousand fruit flies in a bucket of dirt, maybe they'll fight or copulate, he said. But that's about it. Do the same with ants and they'll set to work digging, caring for broods and foraging. What's more, the insects are prime targets for studies of epigenetics, the external factors that toggle genes on and off. “Ants are amazing because with the same genome you can be a queen, or a worker, or another class of worker, or a soldier,” Desplan said. Desplan's research group chose to study a species of jumping ant found in India, Harpegnathos saltator, because all of these ants are potentially fertile. Before laying eggs, though, the workers have to become pseudo-queens. (The scientific term for a pseudo-queen is a “gamergate” — no relation to the anti-feminist video game hullabaloo circa 2014.) If a jumping-ant colony loses its queen, the workers go through a gantlet of ritualized antenna-flailing duels. The victor transforms into a pseudo-queen. Kronauer and his colleagues, led by Rockefeller University graduate student Waring Trible, studied clonal raider ants, Ooceraea biroi. Unlike most ants, the raider ants reproduce asexually, through parthenogenesis. Popularly called virgin birth, it's a phenomenon seen in some snakes, lizards and sharks. The offspring end up as clones of the females. For both species, the desired result of genetic alteration was the same: creating mother ants that gave birth to future generations of mutants. Both research groups mutated their ants in the same way. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, with bacterial molecules acting like scissors to snip out genes, the scientists knocked out a crucial component of the ant's odor receptors. Pheromones, the odors by which ants communicate, are their social medium. Though there are hundreds of olfactory genes in ants, deleting one particular gene — called orco, for odorant receptor co-receptor — effectively renders almost the entire ant olfactory system useless. Removing every individual odor gene would be “essentially impossible,” Kronauer said. But the power of orco to “take out the whole family” of olfactory genes makes it an obvious candidate for manipulation. (It's why both research groups independently decided to focus on deleting the gene.) The insects lost about 90 percent of their olfaction, Desplan said. The behavior of the mutants changed dramatically. The Indian jumping ants wandered away from the colony and wouldn't forage. If Desplan isolated a mutant jumping ant, the ant still became a fertile gamergate. But these pseudo-queens laid very few eggs and were poor mothers. And if the mutants belonged to a colony that lost its queen, they didn't partake in the antennae duels. Instead, they only twitched their antennae when alone, as if shadowboxing. The clonal raider ants that couldn't sense pheromones acted strangely, too. Normally, these ants detest the smell of Sharpie markers. But the mutants marched right over lines drawn in Sharpie. Like the jumping ants, the Ooceraea biroi mutants became antisocial. “Suddenly these ants aren’t really social any more. They wander off, they don’t join the colony,” Kronauer said. “They just walk around.” Nor did they follow the pheromone trails their brethren left. Stranger things happened, too. One particularly odd loner crept into a colony, stole off with an egg and began to groom it with her antennae. All of a sudden she startled. There was no cause for alarm, but the flood of warning pheromones she released sent the rest of the non-mutant colony into a tizzy, Kronauer said. Rockefeller University biologist Daniel Kronauer and his colleagues created the first mutant ants using CRISPR technology. Here's how they did it and what they found. (Kate Bredbenner, SimpleBiologist) Now that scientists know they can alter ant behaviors through their genes, Kronauer plans to study the way colonies divide their labor. Imagine two people living in an apartment. As the dishes pile up, the roommate with a lower threshold for dirty plates begins to wash dishes more often. In the parlance of a biologist observer, that roommate “emerges as a dishwashing specialist.” The old research methods would be to alter the external cues — the equivalent of removing the dishwashing machine and seeing what happens. Through genetic manipulation, Kronauer plans to directly change an ant's internal thresholds. Desplan is interested in the way ants alter their longevity, in addition to sensory perception. Workers live to about seven months old. But workers that become pseudo-queens live for four years. That's like one human twin living to age 85 and the other to age 550. “Expanding by a factor of 10 is unheard of,” Desplan said. Workers who become pseudo-queens turn back to workers once they're exposed to queen pheromones. These former queens die within months. That means there must be a reversible genetic switch that controls the ant life span. Other scientists have taken note of the mutant ant models, Kronauer said, including experts who study honeybees. “People are very excited,” he said, and they have asked whether his lab could help establish a similar protocol in other species. Research such as this opens the door for new model organisms, in Desplan's view. If the traditional bioscience method is to ask many questions of the same organism — such as mice or fruit flies — then genetic engineering techniques allow biologists to ask very specific questions to an animal that fits their needs. If you want to model communities, look to ants. “Even mice don’t have very sophisticated behavior,” Desplan said. Some entomologists became ant experts because they loved ants. For Desplan, his was a more pragmatic affinity. He has worked with insects as varied as fruit flies, wasps and butterflies. And now mutant ants. “We became ant people because we needed to,” he said, “not because we were born ant people.” And, if these model mutants catch on the way Desplan and Kronauer predict, expect the ranks of ant people to swell.

After his planning for an insurrection on 17 September 1652 was leaked to the Dutch authorities, he decided to waste no time in attacking Fort Provintia, which at the time was only surrounded by a bamboo wall. On the night of 7 September the rebels, mostly peasants-farmers armed with bamboo spears, stormed the fort. The following morning a company of 120 Dutch musketeers came to the rescue of their trapped countrymen, firing steadily into the besieging rebel forces and breaking them. Governor Nicolas Verburg On September 11 the Dutch learned that the rebels had massed just north of the principal Dutch settlement of Tayouan. Sending a large force of Dutch soldiers and aboriginal warriors, they met the rebels that day in battle and emerged victorious, mainly due to the superior weaponry of the Europeans.

Premise: She surely is aware that her husband was unfaithful to her before he became president--he admitted as much on national television. 2. Hypothesis: Her husband practically admitted on national television that he was unfaithful to her before he became president. The premise states that the woman is aware of her husband's unfaithfulness before he became a president because he admitted to it on national television. Therefore, there is an implicit assumption that the husband did, in fact, admit his infidelity on live television prior to holding office. The hypothesis suggests that her husband practically admitted on national television to being unfaithful before he became the president. If we consider the premise, we can see that it supports and entails the hypothesis. Since the premise highlights the husband's admission, the hypothesis is a natural and logical conclusion drawn from this context. In conclusion, the premise does entail the hypothesis as the premise establishes a foundation, which supports and leads to the stated hypothesis.

Solve this problem.","output":"Alright little buddy, let's solve this equation together step by step. We have this equation: 15 * o - 25 * o + 117 = 29 * o First, let's deal with the o's on the left side of the equation. We have 15 o's and we need to take away 25 o's from them. So, 15 * o - 25 * o equals -10 * o (it's like having 15 apples and then taking away 25 apples, so you end up with -10 apples). Now our equation will look like this: -10 * o + 117 = 29 * o Next, we need to move the -10 o's from the left side of the equation to the right side so we can have all the o's together. To do this, we need to add 10 * o to both sides of the equation (it's like giving 10 apples back to the left side). So, our new equation will look like this: 117 = 29 * o + 10 * o Now let's add up the o's on the right side. 29 * o + 10 * o equals 39 * o (it's like having 29 balls and then adding 10 more balls, so you end up with 39 balls). Our equation now looks like this: 117 = 39 * o Finally, we need to find out how many times o is in 117, so we will divide 117 by 39. 117 / 39 = 3 So, o = 3. There you go, buddy! We found out that o = 3. Good job solving the equation with me!"},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Think of the savings in terms of fuel bills and unfriendly emissions. Such houses in fact exist, called \\"passive houses\\". The concept of these highly energy-efficient buildings took root in the 1990s, before slowly consolidating as a niche construction concept in the 2000s. Are passive houses now actively moving into the mainstream as sustainable buildings? For Brian McGarry, an economics lecturer who built a family house based on passive housing criteria in the Pyrenees this year, the arguments look convincing. As his first full winter in the low energy house draws in, we asked him to keep us informed. Do passive houses work? I had never heard of a passive house in February 2012, when I purchased a plot of land. Nor did I expect that I would be persuaded to build a pre-constructed, custom-designed house based on energy-efficient passive house criteria. It promised to be easier and quicker to build, cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. The objective was to incorporate the fundamental concepts of passive energy management into my project: an airtight and highly insulated building envelope; large southfacing double or triple-glazed windows (if possible, filled with argon gas) that passively capture the energy of the sun; a heat recovery ventilation system to provide fresh air; and a simple, low-cost heating system consisting of a modern wood-burning stove, a bathroom heater and a portable radiator backup for when the sun doesn't shine and temperatures decline. No significant limitations were placed on the design, and it had excellent environmental credentials. Moreover, the cost was no more than a conventional build. After six months in use, the house is proving to be both cheap to run and remarkably comfortable-staying cool in the hot summer was effortless, as long as the windows were shuttered or shaded from the sun. Nowstaying warm in the cold, high-altitude December climate also seems easy, so far. Winter arrived in force in the... How did Brian McGarry find his self-built passive house?

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Apple is a very sweet fruit.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Apple is a very sour fruit.\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","output":"To determine which sentence is not logical, we need to analyze the general characteristics of apples. Sentence A: \\"Apple is a very sweet fruit.\\" This statement is logical because many apples, such as the Red Delicious, Gala, and Fuji, are known for their sweetness. While not all apples are sweet, there is a significant variety of apples that have a sweet taste. Therefore, it is a logical statement. Sentence B: \\"Apple is a very sour fruit.\\" While some apples like Granny Smith might taste sour, many apples are not sour. Calling apples a \\"very sour fruit\\" may not be an accurate generalization for all types of apples. However, since a few apple varieties do have a sour taste, this statement holds some truth. In conclusion, both sentences have some degree of truth to them, as apples can be sweet, sour, or have a mix of flavors. However, Sentence B might be considered less logical due to its stronger generalization of apples as \\"very sour,\\" whereas Sentence A's description of apples as \\"very sweet\\" is consistent with many popular apple varieties."},{"instruction":"I heard that Remy loved to dance whenever there was any upbeat music playing. And I was wondering Why did Remy do this? The answer is:","output":"Remy, presumably a person or a character, loved to dance whenever there was any upbeat music playing because dancing to energetic music can bring joy, happiness, and positively influence one's mood.

Translate to English","output":"The phrase \\"Die Armut ist weiblich\\" is German and translates to \\"Poverty is female\\" in English. This statement brings attention to the phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty, which concerns the higher prevalence of women experiencing poverty compared to men. This concept emerged in the 20th century and has since become an issue of global significance, particularly in discussions around gender equality. The feminization of poverty is influenced by a combination of factors that contribute to the economic disadvantage faced by women in various societies. Some of these factors include: 1. Wage gap: Women are often paid less than men for similar work, which means they are more likely to experience poverty. This wage gap may be a result of gender discrimination, occupational segregation, or undervaluing of jobs predominantly held by women. 2. Employment opportunities: In many countries, women have limited opportunities for employment outside of traditionally female roles in sectors like education, caregiving, and domestic work. These opportunities often pay less, have fewer benefits, and have less long-term stability compared to male-dominated fields. 3. Unequal access to education: Girls and women may face barriers to education due to poverty, discrimination, or cultural norms. Without equal access to education, women are more likely to work in low-paying jobs and remain in poverty. 4. Family and caretaking responsibilities: Women are often responsible for the majority of caregiving in families, which can limit their ability to work outside the home, especially full-time. This can lead to a reliance on part-time or informal work, which is less secure and generally pays less than full-time employment. 5. Single parenthood: Single mothers are more likely to live in poverty compared to single fathers or parents in two-parent households. This is partly because single mothers may work less due to family caregiving responsibilities and may have limited access to financial resources and support. 6. Legal and social barriers: In some countries, women face legal barriers that restrict their ability to own or inherit property, open bank accounts, or access credit. This hampers their economic independence and can make it difficult for them to escape poverty. 7. Exposure to gender-based violence: Women who experience violence often suffer from the negative economic consequences of abuse, such as lost income, legal fees, and medical expenses. These financial setbacks can lead women to experience poverty or make existing poverty worse. In conclusion, the statement \\"Poverty is female\\" emphasizes the existence of the feminization of poverty, with women being disproportionately affected by economic hardship for various reasons. Addressing the economic inequality faced by women requires tackling the multifaceted problem, which includes addressing gender discrimination, improving access to education and employment opportunities, and striving for systemic change in many areas of society."},{"instruction":"If The managed care debate presents this issue in a slightly different context., can we conclude that \\"More people are siding with managed care in the debate.\\"?

Answer:","output":"To give a comprehensive answer, I will first provide a brief background on the Iranian Revolution and then discuss the significant cultural changes that occurred afterward. Step 1: Understand the historical context The Iranian Revolution, also known as the Islamic Revolution, occurred in 1979 and led to the overthrow of the Pahlavi Dynasty and the establishment of an Islamic republic under the leadership of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. This revolution was fueled by concerns over government corruption, a desire for political independence, and deep religious and social dissatisfaction with the previous regime's policies. Step 2: Identify key cultural shifts After the Iranian Revolution, several major cultural changes took place, including: 1. Transformation of political system: The monarchy was replaced with an Islamic republic, which meant that the political system's foundation changed from secular to religious. Shiite Islam became the official state religion, and the constitution was rewritten to incorporate Islamic law (Sharia). 2. Restriction on personal freedom and civil liberties: After the revolution, the government implemented strict policies in line with Islamic principles, which resulted in the restriction of personal freedom and civil liberties. Censorship became more widespread, and controls were placed on the press, media, and artistic expression. 3. Changes in women's rights: Women's rights and social status saw a significant transformation after the revolution. The new regime imposed the wearing of strict Islamic dress (the hijab) for women. Many women's organizations were disbanded, women lost the right to initiate divorce, and gender segregation was enforced in various sectors, such as schools and workplaces. 4. Education reform: The new government sought to islamize the educational system, purging secular and Western influence in the curriculum. Many faculties were closed temporarily, and thousands of teachers were dismissed or forced to undergo \\"retraining\\" to conform to the new Islamic guidelines. 5. Economic restructuring: The Iranian government took control of various industries, including oil, banking, and transportation, in an effort to redistribute wealth and eliminate class differences. The economic focus shifted more towards self-reliance and domestic production in adherence to Islamic principles. Step 3: Conclusion In conclusion, the culture of Iran underwent significant changes after the 1979 revolution, including the transformation of the political system to an Islamic republic, limitations on personal freedom and civil liberties, alterations in women's rights and education, and economic restructuring. These changes were driven primarily by a desire to align governance and society with traditional Islamic values, which led to a departure from Western influence and secularism that had been prevalent under the Pahlavi Dynasty."},{"instruction":"Hepimizin bir gecede zengin olmasını ummuyordum, ama herkes için adalet beklentim vardı.

The townspeople are curious about her appearance, as no one has seen her yet, and they speculate whether she is ugly or beautiful.

Act 3: The Unraveling of Mystery As Maraya and Daniel's friendship evolves, she reveals to him her secret gift - the power of enchanting beauty that captivates all who lay eyes on her.

Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\". - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - Theta Doradus ( Theta Dor , Doradus , Dor ) is an orange K - type giant with an apparent magnitude of +4.81 . It is approximately 546 light years from Earth . Theta Doradus is moving through the Galaxy at a speed of 31.9 km / s relative to the Sun. Its projected Galactic orbit carries it between 22,400 and 24,800 light years from the center of the Galaxy . - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The apparent magnitude of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of 27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is logarithmic; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of , or about 2.512. - Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. This is a subjective attribute/property of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of color appearance models. Brightness refers to an absolute term and should not be confused with Lightness.

They may be concerned about drugs and alcohol, or they may be worried about who’s driving you. Listen to them calmly and patiently, so they have a chance to express themselves. If you're not sure how to start the conversation, you might say, \\"I know that you're unsure about homecoming. What are you concerned about?\\" It may be difficult, but don’t interrupt your parents when they’re talking. Be respectful and show that you take their concerns seriously. Once you know what your parents’ concerns or objections are, you can try to find ways to address them. In most cases, that means being willing to compromise. For example, they might not want you to go to the post-homecoming activities, so agree that you’ll just go to the dance and come straight home. They may be concerned about your transportation for the evening, so you might suggest that they drive you to and from the dance. Find a way to make you and your parents both at least a little bit happy. Another way to compromise with your parents about homecoming is to suggest periodic check-ins over the course of the night. For example, you might agree to text or call when you arrive at the dance, at some point in the middle, and right before you leave. If you’re headed to post-homecoming activities, you can check in again when you arrive at the locale and when you’re on your way home. If you behave in a mature, responsible way, your parents are more likely to trust you and allow you to go to homecoming. Make a habit of always obeying your curfew, so they know that you'll be home when you say that you will. If they give you chores around the house, do them without your parents having to remind you. You should also be kind to your siblings, and try to resolve conflicts with them without having your parents intervene. Your performance in school can also help convince your parents to let you go. Work to get good grades so they know that you take your responsibilities seriously. If your parents ultimately decide not to allow you to go to homecoming, accept the decision calmly and maturely. Avoid whining or yelling because you didn’t get what you wanted. That will only make your parents angry, so they’re less likely to allow you to attend other events in the future. It can also help convince them that they made the right decision. If you feel yourself getting upset about your parents’ decision, take a moment to count to 10 in your head. That can often help you calm down. Summary:","output":"If your parents don't want you to go to homecoming, ask them why and listen to their reasons. Be respectful and try to find a solution that makes both you and your parents happy, like agreeing to check in with them during the night. Show them you are responsible by doing chores, being kind to siblings, and getting good grades. If they still say no, stay calm and don't get upset, as it could make things worse."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Hypothesis: Women are holding flags, ready to wave them for the car race. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the provided premise, we can make an educated guess to support the hypothesis, but we cannot provide a definitive conclusion without further information. Premise: Two women holding checkered flags near an orange car. The presence of checkered flags and a car might hint at a car race event. Checkered flags are commonly used in auto racing to indicate the start or end of a race, and two women holding them could signify they are either \\"grid girls\\" or race officials responsible for signaling those crucial race moments. Furthermore, bright-colored cars like orange are often used in races to make them more visually distinctive on the track. Hypothesis: Women are holding flags, ready to wave them for the car race. Seeing two women with checkered flags near an orange car might suggest that they are preparing for a car race event. However, the information provided in the premise is limited, and not enough to definitively confirm that the circumstance is related to a car race. There are possible alternative explanations for the given premise: 1. The women could be promoting an event or a car show: The women holding the checkered flags could be working as brand ambassadors, promoting an automobile event, or drawing attention to a new car launch. 2. A marketing photoshoot: The mentioned situation could also be a staged photo for a marketing campaign related to racing, automobile products, or any car-related services. 3. A thematic party or gathering: The women might be involved in a car-racing-themed social event or a party where the checkered flags and the orange car are elements of the party décor. In summary, while the hypothesis is plausible based on the information available in the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that it is an accurate portrayal of the situation. The context described in the premise provides clues that might lead us to believe that the hypothesis could be true, but we would require additional specific information to confirm it with certainty."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: A rider goes around a turn and plants his foot in the dirt to stabilize.

Oak tree: This is the primary subject of the sentence and serves as the main focus. The choice of \\"oak tree\\" also provides specific information about the type of tree, rather than just mentioning a tree in general. The oak tree is the element around which other aspects of the scene revolve. 2. Dark clouds: This phrase offers a description of the state of the sky above the oak tree. It not only sets the mood of the scene as potentially gloomy or ominous, but it also suggests that the weather is about to change. Dark clouds usually indicate poor visibility, which can impact the environment and the appearance of the oak tree itself. 3. Coming rain: This phrase further emphasizes the impending change in the weather and the atmosphere. It explains the presence of dark clouds and suggests that they bring the promise of rain. This information helps to create a sense of anticipation or urgency in the scene, as the expectation of rain might affect the actions of any people or animals present. 4. Storm: The word \\"storm\\" is essential because it amplifies the intensity of the weather conditions. It suggests that the coming rain will not be gentle or brief but rather a forceful and potentially dangerous event. This adds drama and tension to the scene, making it more evocative and memorable. 5. Under: As a preposition, \\"under\\" serves to establish the spatial relationship between the oak tree and the dark clouds. It implies that the dark clouds are above or hovering over the oak tree, which adds depth to the image and helps to create a more vivid mental picture of the scene. Overall, these words are most important because they establish the subject (oak tree) and context (weather conditions) within the sentence while contributing to the creation of a vivid, evocative scene characterized by drama, tension, and urgency."},{"instruction":"- A machine called a pulverizer grinds the coal into a fine powder - The coal powder mixes with hot air, which helps the coal burn more efficiently, and the mixture moves to the furnace - The burning coal heats water in a boiler, creating steam - Steam released from the boiler powers an engine called a turbine, transforming heat energy from burning coal into mechanical energy that spins the turbine engine - The spinning turbine is used to power a generator, a machine that turns mechanical energy into electric energy - This happens when magnets inside a copper coil in the generator spin - A condenser cools the steam moving through the turbine - As the steam is condensed, it turns back into water What might be the last step of the process?

Since they still had some leftover money, they called their mother and she gave them permission to buy whatever they wanted for themselves as long as they shared the money evenly.

How much more would Monica and Sheila each have to add of their own money to buy two pairs of boots?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"1. First, let's find the total cost of the groceries. - Toilet paper: 12 - Large ham: 2 * 12 = 24 2. Let's calculate the remaining money after buying the toilet paper and the large ham. - Initial amount: 50 - Total cost of toilet paper and large ham: 12 + 24 = 36 - Remaining money: 50 - 36 = 14 3. Since the girls must share the remaining money evenly, they will each have half of the remaining amount. - Monica and Sheila's shared money: 14 / 2 = 7 each 4. The cost of a pair of boots is 3 times the amount they had left, which means each pair of boots would cost: - Cost of one pair of boots: 3 * 7 = 21 5. Since Monica and Sheila want to buy two pairs of boots, the total cost of the boots will be: - Total cost of two pairs of boots: 2 * 21 = 42 6. Now, let's find how much more money they need to buy two pairs of boots. - The amount they currently have: 14 (combined) - Total cost of two pairs of boots: 42 - Additional amount needed: 42 - 14 = 28 7. Monica and Sheila need to add 28 of their own money to buy the two pairs of boots.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Karen studied animals in school. She started studying predators for a school presentation. She liked it.

I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember.

It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. The real Mark David Chapman is currently incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, he has not spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title \\"Chapter 27\\" suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, to the point of attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. According to the British music magazine Mojo, the title was also inspired by Chapter 27 of Robert Rosen's book Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon (2000). Rosen's book explores the numerological meaning of the number 27, \\"the triple 9\\", a number of profound importance to John Lennon. Lennon was deeply interested in numerology, particularly Cheiro's Book of Numbers, along with nine and all its multiples.

Since 2002 the line up consists of Chris Cheney (vocals, guitar), Scott Owen (double bass, vocals) and Andy Strachan (drums). The band rose to fame in 1997 after the release of their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. They have released six studio albums and two reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: self-titled album (12 October 1998) and State of Emergency (4 February 2006). Context: The Living End were formed in 1994 by Chris Cheney and Scott Owen, who had met years earlier in primary school through their older sisters and began performing together from 1990 while attending Wheelers Hill Secondary College in Melbourne. Cheney and Owen had their first public gig at The Rob Roy in Melbourne in 1991. Cheney was a fan of rockabilly group Stray Cats and this prompted Owen, who originally played piano, to switch to double bass. The pair formed a cover band, The Runaway Boys, which performed Stray Cats and The Clash material. That group were named after a track, of the same name, from the Stray Cats self-titled debut album (February 1981). The Runaway Boys initially played in the local rockabilly music scene but expanded their audience by performing in regional towns. Cheney later recalled \\"[w]e played to all the jivers and rock 'n' rollers ... And we slowly drifted into Melbourne's rockabilly scene\\". As Cheney and Owen persevered, the band went through several drummers, while they were still attending school. By 1994 Cheney and Owen were writing their own material and decided to change the band's name to The Living End - a reference to the film, Rock Around the Clock (1956). According to Cheney \\"It's an old '50s term, meaning 'far out', 'the greatest' ... We were still into the whole '50s thing, but we wanted a neutral name, one that didn't suggest any one style of music\\". With Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Owen on double bass and backing vocals, the group settled on Joe Piripitzi as their drummer. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance. During that year they recorded a track, \\"Headlines\\", which had been co-written by Cheney and Owen. The group sent a T-shirt and demo tape to Green Day guitarist and lead vocalist, Billie Joe Armstrong, and landed a support slot for the 1995 Australian tour by his band, Green Day. After that tour, The Living End recorded additional tracks for their debut extended play, Hellbound, which received moderate support from community radio stations. It was produced by the group and included \\"Headlines\\" from the previous year. Ed Nimmervoll, an Australian musicologist, described the EP's sound: \\"they turned their back on '50s rock revivalism and adapted that instrumentation to original songs steeped in UK punk\\". In November 1995, the trio recorded their second EP, It's for Your Own Good, which appeared in the following June. The six-track EP was co-produced by Lindsay Gravina (Underground Lovers, Cosmic Psychos), Mike Alonso (Jericho) and The Living End for the Rapido label. It included their first radio airplay hit, \\"From Here on In\\", which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio network, Triple J. Shortly after, Piripitzi was fired as his lifestyle choices were holding back the band. He was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey (later in The Knockout Drops). With Demsey the group appeared at major festivals: Pushover and the Falls Festival. Demsey's drum style was compared with The Who's Keith Moon. \\"From Here on In\\" was used on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, Occasional Course Language. The Living End toured Australia for a year, then in August 1997 they recorded new material to sell at their live shows. Their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", was issued in January the following year. Also that month they had supported The Offspring on the Australian leg of their tour. \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\" peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and was certified double-platinum by ARIA for shipment of 140,000 copies. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 it won the Highest Selling Single category; and eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the 1990s. It lasted a record-breaking 47 weeks in the Top 50. In October 1998 it peaked at No. 28 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It was later featured in the game, Guitar Hero World Tour. \\"Second Solution\\" was used in the soundtrack for the 2002 movie, Cheats, which starred Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, and Mary Tyler Moore. Early in 1998 \\"Prisoner of Society\\" was issued as a separate single in the United Kingdom and, the following year, in the US. The single appeared in the top 200 of the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard's Alternative Songs Chart. The band signed with Modular Recordings for the release of their debut self-titled album, which appeared on 12 October 1998, and was co-produced by Gravina with the trio. It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, became the then-second highest-selling debut rock album in Australian music history and, by 1999, was certified 4x Platinum for shipment of 280,000 units. Their next Australian single, \\"Save the Day\\", was issued in September 1998, a month ahead of the album. It made the top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It became their highest charting hit on the New Zealand Singles Chart, where it reached No. 10. From the album, a total of six singles were released including a live cover version of \\"Tainted Love\\", which was issued as a radio-only single on Triple J. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999, The Living End won two more awards: Best Group and Breakthrough Artist - Album. At the ceremony they were also nominated for Album of the Year and Highest Selling Album. In October 2010 their debut album was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. The Living End's second album, Roll On, was recorded during July 2000 with Nick Launay (Midnight Oil, Models, Silverchair) producing and appeared in November that year. It peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart and reached the top 40 in New Zealand. Although Roll On was a more creative work, Nimmervoll mentioned that they had \\"broadened their musical scope while keeping in tact what made them unique - the instrumentation and the socially-aware lyrics\\". The album did not achieve the status of their earlier album as it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 copies. Despite this, fans consider it to be as strong as the self-titled album; \\"[it's] an absolute scorcher! That's what years of live honing can do for a band that was already white-hot\\". Cheney later stated that he was trying to prove to critics that The Living End were not a band simply defined by their hit, \\"Prisoner of Society\\", and the album showed this by displaying other influences, as well as their traditional fast-paced rockabilly music. Rolling Stone' Jenny Eiscu compared it to The Clash's creative breakthrough, London Calling (December 1979), as they \\"stomp all over the boundaries between punk, reggae, rockabilly and plain old rock & roll - and it still sounds like a revelation, twenty-two years after [T]he Clash did it. The pupils don't quite outpace the masters here ... But the band is obviously having such a riotously good time that you'd be a sucker not to stomp your foot and join the party\\". Much of the style was comparable to 1980s hard rock and pub rock, as well as many tracks being obscure mixes of many ideas, resulting in 'procrastinating' structures. This defined the album's creativity. The album's first two singles, \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" and the title track, peaked into the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" also reached the top 20 in New Zealand, while \\"Roll On\\" peaked at No. 33 on the Billboard Alternative Songs Chart, and appeared in the top 150 of the UK Singles Chart. In March 2001 Billboard's review of Roll On described their sound as \\"Aussie punkabilly\\", while the group's lyrics show a \\"socially progressive attitude, discussing prejudice, racism, and political conflict\\". The trio received US-wide coverage by playing on both Conan O'Brien's and David Letterman's late-night variety shows. The album included \\"Carry me Home\\", which appeared on the Guitar Hero II soundtrack. However, touring in support of Roll On and the related singles was halted after Cheney had a car accident on the Great Ocean Road, rendering him unable to play for a significant period of time: he was \\"hospitalised for 2 months\\". He had been on travelling to the house of a member of fellow Australian band and tour mates, Bodyjar. Question: When was it recorded?. Whats the answer?","output":"The Living End's second album, Roll On, was recorded in July 2000."},{"instruction":"Test sentence: \\"He's a reliable enough man.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"Yes, the test sentence \\"He's a reliable enough man.\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence. Let's break down its components to understand why it is grammatically correct: 1. Subject: \\"He\\" – This is a singular third person pronoun, which serves as the subject of the sentence. 2. Auxiliary verb: \\"is\\" – The verb \\"is\\" is contracted with the subject to form \\"He's\\". \\"Is\\" is the third person singular form of the verb \\"to be\\" and is an auxiliary verb, which is used to provide additional information about the main verb. In this case, \\"is\\" works as a linking verb to connect the subject \\"he\\" to the predicate (a description or action related to the subject). 3. Adjective + Adverb: \\"reliable enough\\" – \\"reliable\\" is an adjective that describes the subject \\"he\\", and \\"enough\\" is an adverb that modifies the adjective \\"reliable\\". When \\"enough\\" is placed after an adjective, it indicates a sufficient or adequate level of the quality expressed by that adjective. Thus, \\"reliable enough\\" means that the subject possesses a satisfactory level of reliability. 4. Noun: \\"man\\" – This is the noun complement that further specifies the subject \\"he\\". It is connected to the subject by the linking verb \\"is\\" and provides additional information about the subject, describing what or who \\"he\\" is. The sentence follows the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) order, which is common in English sentences. The subject is \\"He\\", the verb is \\"is\\" (in its contracted form), and the object (or noun complement) is \\"man\\". The adjective \\"reliable\\" and the adverb \\"enough\\" together function as an attribute complement in the sentence, providing information about the subject. In conclusion, the test sentence \\"He's a reliable enough man.\\" is a grammatically correct English sentence, as it follows standard English grammar rules, including a subject, verb, and object, along with appropriate modifiers."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): WBZW (1520 AM) is a radio station in Altamonte Springs, Florida.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy. After reading the above, is \\"16 years\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How many years passed between Portugal declaring bankruptcy and the assassination of King Carlos and Prince Luis Filipe?\\"?","output":"No, \\"16 years\\" is not the correct answer to the question.

DNA is something that everybody has, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our mother and father, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Gregor Mendel discovered a special reason why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things named \\"genes\\" in our body. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick made another discovery and found out that those small parts are real messages written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Johann Matthaci found a message in DNA showing how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. Scientists have now found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \\"word\\" means, we can help save more people from several illnesses. Most people hope that this will help make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when people begin to know more words and find out lots of other information, we might use it in a wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people from getting jobs.

One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits. Charles Ares, a member of the board of directors in the 1950s, said the office was kind of a charity operation. Do you have any questions?","output":"Congratulations to Southern Arizona Legal Aid for achieving 50 years of providing free legal advice and for securing the recent grants to further enhance their services. I do have some questions about the new developments and the organization itself: 1. How will the 6.6 million grant be distributed over the three-year period for staffing operations? Are there specific areas or programs within the organization that will receive more focus or expansion? 2. What specific services or resources will be available on the new website created by the 50,000 grant? Will there be information on various legal issues, ways to find lawyers, or perhaps an online chat service for immediate help? 3. How will Southern Arizona Legal Aid ensure that its services are reaching all poor people in Arizona, especially those who may not have easy access to the internet or are in rural and isolated areas? 4. Are there any plans to collaborate with public libraries, schools, or courthouses across Arizona to ensure that access to these legal resources via the new website is promoted and available to those who need it? 5. How has the organization evolved and expanded over the years in terms of the scope of services offered, staffing, and financial resources? What key milestones or achievements have been made during this 50-year period? 6. Apart from the current grants, what other avenues of funding or support does Southern Arizona Legal Aid rely on to provide free legal advice? Are there any long-term partnerships or collaborations with other organizations or institutions that contribute to its mission? 7. What are some of the most common legal issues that the organization helps people with, and how does the organization measure the impact of its services on alleviating these issues for its clients? 8. How are the volunteers and staff of Southern Arizona Legal Aid trained and supported in providing these services? Are there any continuing education or professional development opportunities offered to ensure their expertise remains current? 9. Can you share any success stories or examples of how Southern Arizona Legal Aid has made a significant difference in clients' lives, particularly those who may not have had access to justice otherwise? Lastly, are there any plans for further expansion or additional programs in the coming years?

The calculator helps you navigate through this data with ease. Simply enter the name of your club and you'll have all the key data presented and put into context for you. In addition you can work out how much support of your team is costing you. Simply enter your ticket cost, food, drink and programme spend, plus how many replica shirts you buy and the amount you pay on TV sports subscriptions. The calculator will then compare that to a number of costs, such as player wages, transfer fees and other leisure pursuits. Throughout the calculator, we compare how various costs have changed using data from previous BBC Price of Football studies. Some data comparisons are not available for clubs not included in previous years. The 'price of a goal' is calculated by dividing the cost of a club's cheapest season ticket last season by the number of goals scored by the team at home in the same season. Some comparisons are not available for clubs not surveyed last season, or promoted to the National League. Programme costs were not collected from European clubs, as many do not publish match-day programmes in the same way as UK teams. The BBC contacted 227 clubs for the study. Of those, 200 were in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales and another 27 in Europe. The data was collated and verified by BBC Sport journalists. Swansea are omitted from the survey and calculator because they declined to take part. All ticket prices refer to an adult ticket when bought individually. The match-day ticket prices quoted refer to high and low prices available on the day of a game, to reflect the price for fans who decide on match day they would like to attend a game, and not individual offers. Match-day costs reflect categories that are registered with the relevant league, rather than individual, or one-off, offers. The season ticket prices quoted refer to the cheapest possible ticket (including early bird offers), and the most expensive season ticket. Replica shirt prices are listed according to the official cost in the club shop or website - rather than separate retailers.

It is known for its snacks like Bikaneri Bhujia. Other famous dishes include bajre ki roti (millet bread) and lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), mawa kachori Mirchi Bada, Pyaaj Kachori and ghevar from Jodhpur, Alwar ka Mawa(Milk Cake), malpauas from Pushkar and rassgollas from Bikaner. Originating from the Marwar region of the state is the concept Marwari Bhojnalaya, or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the Marwari people. 4 Dal-Bati-Churma is very popular in Rajasthan.

This pungent and spicy chutney is traditionally prepared using a few basic ingredients: garlic, red chillies, cumin seeds, and occasionally, some tamarind for a tangy twist. These ingredients are ground together to form a paste that can be stored for several days without spoilage. Because of the scarcity of fresh vegetables and other resources in Rajasthan's arid region, foods that had a longer shelf-life were favored and Lashun ki Chutney is one such representative condiment of this inherent aspect of Rajasthani cuisine. The experience of eating this chutney is as multifaceted as the land of Rajasthan itself. Its hot and tangy nature not only punctuates the Rajasthani meals but also illustrates how the inhabitants of this desert area have converted a scarce availability of resources into an unmissable culinary triumph. The chutney's robust red color is indicative of the usage of red chillies, hence it is named as \\"hot garlic paste\\". This chutney is often served with Bajre ki roti (millet bread) or as an accompaniment to the main courses, enhancing the overall flavor and adding a dash of spice to the meal.

Around 1560 Russia interacted with Kabardia but thereafter left the region alone except for the Caspian coast. In 1800 Russia annexed eastern Georgia and by 1806 held Transcaucasia from the Black Sea to the Caspian. Since Russia also claimed the steppes north of the mountains its claims were divided by the free mountaineers of the Caucasus. Russia had to hold the Georgian Military Highway in the center so the war against the mountaineers was divided into eastern and western parts. Circassia refers to a region the majority of whose inhabitants before the 1860s were the Adygey ethnic group, known to the West as Circassians. This region consisted for the most part of the region between the westward flowing Kuban River to the north and the Caucasus mountain range to the south, although the Kuban River constituted only part of the northern boundary. The Circassians were never politically united for a long period. The western bulk of Circassia, they belonged to any of about ten tribes, living in communities headed by chieftains. In the east of Circassia were two feudal polities, Greater Kabardá and Lesser Kabardá. In the late 1550s, the ruler of one of the Kabardás, Temryuk , struck a politico-military alliance with Tsar Ivan IV of Russia , for mutual assistance against expansionist attacks by the Persian and Ottoman Empires. In this period of history, the Circassians were Christians; Islam did not begin to penetrate Circassia until the following century. In the 1560s Ivan and Temryuk directed forts to be constructed, including Tumnev at the western end of Circassian lands and at Sunzha Ostrog at the mouth of the Sunzha river, at the eastern end of Circassian lands. How many years after interacting with Kabardia did Russia annex eastern Georgia?","output":"Russia interacted with Kabardia around 1560 and annexed eastern Georgia in 1800. To find out how many years passed between those events, we can subtract the earlier year (1560) from the later year (1800): 1800 - 1560 = 240 years. So, 240 years passed after Russia interacted with Kabardia before they annexed eastern Georgia."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer from options.

Replace parallel meaning transition words and phrases with “therefore. Include “therefore” to improve sentence flow. Article:","output":"Title: The Power of \\"Therefore\\": Enhancing Your Writing Style and Flow Introduction Good writing often stems from careful consideration of words and phrases that can improve the overall readability and clarity of your work. One such word that can significantly enhance your writing style and flow is \\"therefore.\\" This simple yet powerful word is a versatile and valuable tool that can replace parallel meaning transition words and phrases while demonstrating cause and effect relationships within your text. In this article, we will explore how using \\"therefore\\" can help you achieve greater coherence and logical progression in your writing. The Magic of \\"Therefore\\" By nature, \\"therefore\\" is a conjunctive adverb that effectively conveys cause and effect relationships. When used appropriately, it can create a natural flow in your writing, providing readers with a clear understanding of the logical progression of your ideas. Moreover, it can replace other transition words and phrases with parallel meanings, simplifying your writing and making it more concise. Take, for example, the sentence: \\"The evidence suggests a strong correlation between poor air quality and respiratory health problems; therefore, improving air quality should be a priority for public health policy.\\" In this instance, \\"therefore\\" demonstrates the cause and effect relationship between air quality and respiratory health, tying the two concepts together and enabling the reader to make a logical connection between them without any ambiguity. Using \\"Therefore\\" to Replace Parallel Meaning Transitions Several transition words and phrases convey cause and effect relationships, such as \\"as a result,\\" \\"consequently,\\" \\"due to,\\" \\"owing to,\\" and \\"thus.\\" While some variety is desirable in writing, using \\"therefore\\" to replace these parallel meanings can help streamline your text and create a more coherent writing style. Consider the following sentences: 1. Jane faced numerous obstacles throughout her journey, and as a result, she learned valuable lessons about self-reliance. 2. John faced many difficulties due to his lack of preparation, which ultimately led to his failure. By incorporating \\"therefore\\" into these sentences, we improve the flow and coherence of the text: 1. Jane faced numerous obstacles throughout her journey; therefore, she learned valuable lessons about self-reliance. 2. John faced many difficulties due to his lack of preparation; therefore, he ultimately failed. Including \\"Therefore\\" to Improve Sentence Flow The proper placement of \\"therefore\\" can dramatically enhance the flow of your writing by guiding readers through a logical progression of ideas. When using \\"therefore,\\" it is essential to place it in a position where it will effectively signal a cause and effect relationship between two clauses or sentences. For example: - Incorrect: \\"Therefore, Sarah skipped breakfast, she was running late for work.\\" - Correct: \\"Sarah was running late for work; therefore, she skipped breakfast.\\" In the correct example, \\"therefore\\" links the cause (running late for work) with the effect (skipping breakfast), creating a clear and logical connection for the reader. Conclusion Mastering the art of using \\"therefore\\" in your writing can have a significant impact on the overall quality and readability of your work. By incorporating this powerful word into your writing style and replacing parallel meaning transition words and phrases, you can successfully establish cause and effect relationships, improve sentence flow, and create a more coherent and logical text for your readers to enjoy."},{"instruction":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Zizzi, eatType = coffee shop, priceRange = £20-25, customer rating = high, area = riverside, familyFriendly = no","output":"Zizzi, a highly-rated coffee shop in the riverside area, offers an exclusive non-family-friendly dining experience with a price range of £20-25."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Polish.

This relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels. Typically, a sister is depicted as a pile-on who can be used for ransom in the climax. This movie treats the subject in an entirely different light. It is inspired by George Eliot's novel \\"The Mill on the Floss\\". The brother is very prosaic, all-good, the blue-eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society. In spite of this, the love of the brother-sister is the winner. This movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world. Although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries, yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as appreciative and insightful, highlighting the emotional depth and the unique representation of the brother-sister relationship in the movie.

The review also draws a comparison between the two main characters - the prosaic brother and the wild, defiant sister - and their complex bond.

PM David Cameron announced on Friday that he would step down by October. He had urged the country to vote Remain in Thursday's referendum, but the Leave campaign won by 52% to 48%. Since Thursday's vote there has been intense speculation about who will replace Mr Cameron, and when and how the UK will begin formal negotiations to exit the EU. Meanwhile, potential leadership contender Boris Johnson has been meeting with Conservative MPs Jake Berry and Ben Wallace at his home. The BBC understands he also met with justice secretary and fellow Leave campaigner Michael Gove. Several sources have told BBC political editor Laura Kuennsberg that Mr Gove will co-chair Mr Johnson's leadership campaign, if he runs. Mr Johnson, who is widely expected to announce his leadership bid in the coming days, plans to run on a \\"unity\\" ticket, with a prominent Remainer part of the campaign leadership, our editor said. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May has been canvassing opinion among MPs and is expected to announce her leadership bid in the next couple of days. Our political editor said there was a growing sense among Tory MPs that only two or three names will enter the leadership contest because it is about choosing the next prime minister, rather than a wide field that would be narrowed down by the Parliamentary party. International Development secretary, Justine Greening, suggested today that Boris Johnson and Theresa May should come to a deal rather than having a drawn out contest at all. Mr Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Leave, said: \\"The government itself now had a view... which was to remain, and so now we need to change that position and actually deliver on this very clear mandate from the British people.\\" He said he was \\"incredibly sad\\" Mr Cameron had chosen to go as he wanted him to \\"remain to help stabilise the situation and get us moving\\". \\"But I do think it would be very, very difficult for the public who have voted for leaving the European Union to find that they then had a prime minister who actually was opposed to leaving the European Union. \\"So I think it is quite clear that - at least the leadership end of it - but I would like all the others, Remain and us, to come together.\\" Mr Duncan Smith also ruled himself out of the future Conservative leadership contest. He said the House of Commons had \\"an obligation to deliver on the British people's verdict\\" and progress with leaving the EU. \\"The Conservative party is in a majority in the House of Commons and my view about this is there are also a number of Labour MPs who are very clear they want this to be delivered on,\\" he said. When questioned about the Leave campaign's assertion that leaving the EU would free up Â£350m a week extra to spend on the NHS, Mr Duncan Smith said the NHS would receive \\"the lion's share\\". \\"It is not a promise broken, I never said that during the course of the election,\\" he said. \\"What I said was we would be able to spend the lion's share of that money, now the government is now able to spend, so people can say that there is more money available now for the NHS, categorically more, which is what's required and that's the key point.\\" Asked if UKIP leader Nigel Farage - a key Leave figure - would be involved in the cross-party exit negotiations with Brussels, Mr Duncan Smith suggested the party's sole MP Douglas Carswell would be consulted. \\"There is a UKIP MP who is part of that process in a parliamentary sense, and I'm very happy to discuss... with UKIP about what their expectations are, but the government itself, right now, actually dictates how this will happen,\\" he said. On immigration, he said the Conservative government had to honour its manifesto pledge to bring net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving - down to below 100,000. Mr Duncan Smith said: \\"I said consistently throughout that we need to get control of our borders and the only way to do that is to leave the European Unionâ€¦ \\"Once we do that we are in a much stronger position to achieve that objective of bringing down migration to tens of thousands within this Parliament - I will stand by that.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article is about the aftermath of the UK's referendum on leaving the European Union, with a focus on the Conservative party's leadership contest following David Cameron's resignation announcement.

On the other hand, the term \\"adolescent boy\\" simply refers to a teenager's gender and age. Although adolescence is a challenging developmental stage for many young people, referring to someone as an adolescent doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative connotation. When combining the two terms, the sentiment is mostly influenced by the \\"unruly\\" descriptor. Describing an adolescent boy as unruly suggests that he may engage in disruptive behaviors, struggle to follow rules, and resist authority, all of which tend to be undesirable traits. Although it's essential to note that the sentence may lack context and does not provide information on the circumstances surrounding the individual, the use of the adjective \\"unruly\\" to describe the adolescent boy is sufficient to determine that the sentiment of the sentence is generally negative."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 568*y - 5218*y = -97650 for y.","output":"Alright, let's work on this step by step. The equation given is: 568*y - 5218*y = -97650 Step 1: To simplify this, let's combine like terms on the left-hand side of the equation, those being 568*y and -5218*y. Subtracting 5218 from 568, we get -4650. So the equation simplifies to -4650*y = -97650. Step 2: Next we need to solve for y. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is -4650. This will isolate y on one side of the equation, giving us the solution. Mathematically, this looks like: (-97650) / (-4650) = y. Step 3: Performing this division gives us a solution of y = 21. So, the solution to the equation 568*y - 5218*y = -97650 is y = 21."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Nate and Andy were two zoologists. They have been studying the characteristics of nocturnal and diurnal animals. Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals. Which zoologist learned less about bats? Hint: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. The answer is:","output":"To determine which zoologist learned less about bats, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. Nate and Andy are two zoologists studying characteristics of nocturnal and diurnal animals. 2. Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals. 3. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day, and diurnality is the opposite. Now, let's consider the hint provided: 1. Animals use crypsis to avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting by being nocturnal. 2. Bats are mentioned as an example of an animal that uses echolocation and has an optimum evening emergence time to balance the risk of predation and foraging. Since the question is about which zoologist learned less about bats and the hint focuses mainly on nocturnal animals, we can reach the conclusion that: Bats are primarily nocturnal animals. Therefore, Andy, who studied nocturnal animals, would have learned more about bats than Nate, who studied diurnal animals. The answer is: Nate learned less about bats."},{"instruction":"Title: Amazon falls down on the job Review: Usually we can depend on Amazon to only market and promote honesty and be a reliable seller of product...However, in this case they have fallen down on the job, selling non 88xl cartridges as xl's or, in one case, substituting two regular 88's for one 88xl.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? More people were born in the last year than were born in any year before 1960.","output":"The statement \\"More people were born in the last year than were born in any year before 1960\\" does follow the information provided in the preceding text. The text tells us that 2.6 billion of today's 5.6 billion people were born since 1960, which amounts to approximately 46 percent of the global population. This indicates that the population growth has accelerated in recent decades compared to the time before 1960. Population growth is generally influenced by factors such as fertility rates, mortality rates, and migration. An increase in fertility rates and/or a decrease in mortality rates can lead to an increase in population. Technological advancements in healthcare, improved living conditions, and increased access to education and resources have contributed to a decline in mortality rates and an overall increase in the global population. Moreover, the post-1960 period witnessed the demographic transition in several developing countries, characterized by both increasing population growth and declining fertility rates due to industrialization, urbanization, and expanding education and healthcare access. The baby boom period that occurred in various countries, particularly in the Western world, as well as the increase in birth rates in developing countries, led to a considerable rise in the number of people being born each year since 1960. For example, between 1950 and 1960, the annual global number of births stood around 97 million. However, this number rose to 139 million by 1989. Therefore, based on the acceleration of population growth since 1960, it is reasonable to infer that more people were born in the last year than in any year before 1960. While the fertility rates have been gradually declining in the recent decades, it is important to note that this trend may not hold for every individual year or location due to fluctuations and local variations in demographic factors.

Begin a conversation and ask a simple question.Watch carefully for eye movement during the response.If the person looks up, he or she is thinking or forming pictures.This is also a sign of a visual thinker.Looking up and to the left shows recalling a memory, while looking up and to the right could show imaginative construction or lying. If the person looks down, this could be a sign of obedience or even blame.Looking down and to the left can show a person talking to themselves.Looking down and to the right can show that they are feeling strong emotion. Looking sideways can indicate distraction or checking out a potential threat, hut a sideways glance can also show anger.In addition, eyes that look side to side often show shiftiness and lying.

His ex-wife (Kim Raver) believes that he is a bad example to their ten-year-old son Nick (Jake Cherry), and Larry fears that Nick respects his future stepfather, bond trader Don (Paul Rudd), more than him. Cecil Fredricks (Dick Van Dyke), an elderly night security guard about to retire from the American Museum of Natural History, hires Larry despite his unpromising rÃ©sumÃ©. The museum, which is rapidly losing money, plans to replace Cecil and two colleagues Gus (Mickey Rooney) and Reginald (Bill Cobbs) with one guard.

For example, why do some people paint the walls of their rooms yellow and others pink? The same is true in stores. They want us to feel something when we look at their products. Green, for example, tries to show the quality of a product: how good it is for us or for our environment. It also suggests that the product is healthier, has less fat and maybe fewer calories. Red, on the other hand is an aggressive color that is often used for packaging food. Red wants us to become hungry or thirsty. Purple is a kind of color that is often seen as royal. It indicates that it is something special. Producers use purple to show that something is of good quality. Blue is not very often found in food packaging because there are not very many foods that have a blue color. Colors can also have different meaning in different cultures and countries. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries. The Egyptian pharaohs wore white crowns. A white sale is a sale of sheets, towels, and other bed and bath items. A white flag is the universal symbol for truce . A white elephant is a rare, pale elephant sacred to the people of India, Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. In these countries, something that is a white elephant is either a possession that costs more than it is worth to keep or an item that the owner doesn't want but can't get rid of.

The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums. The Romans never really infiltrated Ibiza, and even after the defeat of Hannibal in 202 b.c. during the Second Punic War their influence was restrained. Only with the fall of Carthage in 146 b.c. did they manage to make inroads, but, as local historians stress, Ibiza was neither conquered nor annexed by Rome, but confederated, retaining remarkable autonomy. For centuries to come the old Carthaginian traditions were allowed to continue on Ibiza alongside the new Roman way of life.

We have an equation: -1344 = 41*j + 39*j -24*j First, let's combine those j's that are being multiplied by those numbers (41, 39, and -24). You can imagine this like having 41 apples, 39 apples, and taking away 24 apples. How many apples do you have left? 41 apples + 39 apples - 24 apples = (41 + 39 - 24) apples Now let's add the numbers: 41 + 39 = 80 80 - 24 = 56 So our new equation will be: -1344 = 56 * j Now we need to figure out how many times we have to multiply the 'j' with 56 to get -1344. You can think of this as sharing -1344 pieces of candy evenly among 56 kids, and we need to find out how many pieces of candy each kid gets. To do this, we'll divide -1344 by 56. -1344 ÷ 56 = -24 So our solution is: j = -24 This means that when we multiply 56 by -24, we get -1344."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: In which state is the headquarters of software company Flux located?","output":"The headquarters of software company Flux is located in the particular state where the company has established its primary office for operations and management."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

As Kyle confided in Nick that this would be his first time leading a prayer meeting, a heavy feeling of nervousness and anxiety began to surface within him. Aware of the responsibility he was about to undertake, he couldn't help but feel apprehensive about the task at hand. Emotions surged through Kyle's heart as countless thoughts raced through his mind – questions about whether he could do justice to the role and provide comfort to the people attending the prayer meeting. Kyle knew that prayer meetings were important gatherings, occasions where individuals would come together to seek solace, guidance, and a deeper connection with their spiritual beliefs. It was essential that he, as the leader, create an atmosphere conducive to the attendees' spiritual growth and their journey toward a better understanding of their faith. As his fears threatened to overwhelm him, Kyle remembered Nick – who had been in a similar position before, taking the lead in the group's prayer meetings. He realized that, although nervous, he was not alone in this journey. Looking at his friend, Kyle mustered the courage to share his thoughts, seeking not only advice but also reassurance that he could indeed handle the task at hand.

Fred started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's. His cholesterol is very high now. Vic became a vegan later,and he is in a very good physical shape. But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. What is an answer for this question: Which friend had a decreased blood flow to the heart? A:","output":"Based on the given information and background, it is most likely that Fred, who started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's and now has very high cholesterol, experienced a decrease in blood flow to the heart. This is due to the role of cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis, as described in the background. When Fred consumed excessive amounts of junk food and fatty foods, his cholesterol levels increased. High cholesterol is one of the factors that contribute to atherosclerosis, a disorder in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. Over time, these deposits form plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through blood vessels. Restricted blood flow in the coronary arteries can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. In more severe cases, it can result in a complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart, causing a heart attack, which can lead to significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, and in some cases, death. On the other hand, Vic became a vegan later in life and is now in excellent physical shape. By choosing a plant-based diet, he likely eliminated many sources of unhealthy fats and cholesterol, reducing his risk of developing atherosclerosis and, subsequently, having decreased blood flow to the heart. In conclusion, Fred, with his unhealthy dietary habits and high cholesterol levels, is the friend who likely experienced a decreased blood flow to the heart. Adopting a healthier lifestyle, like Vic's vegan diet, can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and maintain overall heart health."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: mediocre fable from burkina faso .

The reviewer's choice of language suggests disappointment or dissatisfaction with the film's quality, and there is a strong indication that it has not met their expectations. Furthermore, it gives the impression that the movie simply did not leave a lasting or favorable impact on the critic, tarnishing its overall reputation.

On one hand, the reviewer highlights the enjoyable aspects of the book, specifically the erotic writing, which they are clearly drawn to as a fan of the series. This portrays the book in a positive light by emphasizing its engaging and tantalizing nature for readers who appreciate this genre. Such people would likely view this aspect of the review as flattering. Moreover, the reviewer also establishes a sense of continuity by mentioning the previous books in the series, \\"Sinful\\" and \\"Wicked.\\" For those who have enjoyed these prior installments, this connection may spark interest in reading the latest book, solidifying the flattering perspective. On the other hand, the review paints an unflattering picture of the book by pointing out its shortcomings. The battle scenes are described as \\"too much,\\" and it is mentioned that the reviewer had to skip a couple of pages due to boredom. This indicates that the pacing and content of the book may not be engaging for all readers, particularly those expecting a more romance-focused storyline. The mention of the book's focus on war and its details might also be seen as unflattering for those who purchased the book with the expectation of an erotic romance. Nevertheless, this aspect might appeal to readers who are interested in both eroticism and war-related narratives. It could even be taken as a recommendation for those with such interests. In conclusion, this review paints the product in both flattering and unflattering lights, depending on the readers' preferences and expectations. For those seeking a spicy erotic romance, this review might dissuade them as the book seemingly doesn't reach the same levels of spice as the prior installments in the series.

Article: The small unframed painting called \\"Fisherman\\" was signed by a little-known Italian artist, Maveleone (1669-1740). When it was sold recently in New York for 27000, the seller, Mr. Oliver Pitt, was asked to explain how the picture had come into his possession. Pitt said, \\"I didn't know it was so valuable. I'm not an art expert. Photography is my hobby. I bought 'Fisherman' in Italy in 1970 for 140.the picture was dirty, and I couldn't see the artist's signature. But anyway it wasn't the picture that I like. I bought it because of the frame.\\" \\"It's most unusual frame, made of tiny, silvery sea-shells. They are set in such a way that they reflect perfect light onto the surface of a picture. I now have a photograph of my wife in that frame, and I'll never part with it.\\" \\"When I returned to New York I showed the painting in its frame to a customs officer. I told him that I had paid 140 for it but admitted I didn't know its actual worth. The customs man valued it at 140, and I was asked to pay duty on that value. I did so, there and then.\\" \\"Later, I took off the frame, and that uncovered Maveleone's signature. My wife suggested in fun that the painting might be a valuable one, so I cleaned it and put it up for sale.\\" As a result of his explanation, Oliver Pitt had to appear in court. He was accused of knowingly making a false statement of the value of a picture so as to cheat the Customs Department. Pitt was not happy. \\"I told the truth as I knew it then,\\" he said, \\"What else could I say?\\" And then the judge agreed with him. \\"The Customs Department is to be responsible (blame),\\" he said, \\"for making a true valuation of goods bought into the country, so that the correct amount of duty may be charged. Mr Pitt did not cause or try to cause the mistake that was made. He paid the duty that was demanded. If now, the Customs Department finds that its valuation was not correct, it cannot be allowed to have another try. Pitt is not guilty. Question: Which is true according to the passage? - Pitt knew the true value of the picture. - Pitt's wife knew the true value of the picture. - When Pitt's wife suggested keeping the picture, she was kind of joking. - Pitt didn't pay any duty at all.

Which case would see smaller opportunity for food sources, case A or case B? Greg was studying behavior of different organisms. He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case B. He was astonished by the complicated interactions among organisms. Hint: Ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines. The answer to this question is:","output":"Case A would see smaller opportunity for food sources. In case A, organisms exhibit inquiline behavior, which means they live within the ant nests and can have a complex relationship with the host ants. These organisms may compete for the same food sources as the ants (e.g., larvae, eggs, and food stores), or they may depend on the ants for their own survival (e.g., through Wasmannian mimicry). On the other hand, in case B, organisms do not exhibit inquiline behavior and therefore do not rely on the ants' resources as a food source or as a means for survival. These organisms would have access to a wider range of food sources available in their environment, which would ultimately present more opportunities for food sources when compared to case A."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: when does the tour de france finish 2018?","output":"To find the answer to this question, I will search the internet for information about the finishing date of the Tour de France 2018.

Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi (Nu'aymi) and \`Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad \`Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani (Humayqani) were named as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224. Nu'aymi was designated for providing financial support to al-Qa'ida, Asbat al-Ansar, al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and al-Shabaab, and Humayqani was designated for providing financial support to and acting on behalf of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). \\"It is essential for countries to take proactive steps to disrupt terrorist financing, especially where al-Qa'ida and its affiliates are concerned. We will continue to work with our partners in the Gulf to ensure that charitable donations are not used to support violence in the region or elsewhere,\\" said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. Nu'aymi is a Qatar-based terrorist financier and facilitator who has provided money and material support and conveyed communications to al-Qa'ida and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen for more than a decade. He was considered among the most prominent Qatar-based supporters of Iraqi Sunni extremists. Humayqani has used his Yemen-based charity as a cover for funneling financial support to AQAP and has frequently traveled throughout the Arabian Peninsula while conducting business for AQAP. During political unrest in Yemen, Humayqani reportedly assisted AQAP in gaining a foothold and safe haven in al-Bayda' Governorate, Yemen and as of mid-2011 served as the acting AQAP amir there. Both Nu'aymi and Humayqani are at the center of global support networks that fund and facilitate terrorism. As a result of today's designation, any assets these individuals may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from doing business with them. 'Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi In 2013, Nu'aymi ordered the transfer of nearly 600,000 to al-Qa'ida via al-Qa'ida's representative in Syria, Abu-Khalid al-Suri, and intended to transfer nearly 50,000 more. Nu'aymi has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qa'ida in Iraq leaders and Qatar-based donors. Nu'aymi reportedly oversaw the transfer of over 2 million per month to al-Qa'ida in Iraq for a period of time. He also served as an interlocutor between these Qatari nationals and al-Qa'ida in Iraq leaders. Between 2003 and 2004, Nu'aymi provided support to the Iraqi insurgency more broadly and served as a conduit for their broadcast materials to media outlets. Nu'aymi as of mid-2012 provided approximately 250,000 to two U.S.-designated al-Shabaab figures, Mukhtar Robow and Sheikh Hassan Aweys Ali, the latter of whom is also designated by the United Nations (UN). Also in 2012, Nuaymi provided financial support to a charity headed by Yemen-based Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, who channeled funding to AQAP. \`Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad \`Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani In his capacity as the head of a Yemen-based charity, Humayqani has used his status in the charitable community to fundraise and has provided some of that funding to AQAP and has facilitated financial transfers from AQAP supporters in Saudi Arabia to Yemen in support of AQAP operations. As of 2012, Humayqani was an important figure within AQAP and reportedly had a relationship with important AQAP leaders. Humayqani and others in March 2012 reportedly orchestrated an AQAP attack on a Yemeni Republican Guard base in al-Bayda' Governorate, Yemen. The attack employed multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and killed seven. He is suspected to have recruited individuals to AQAP who were involved in a plot to assassinate Yemeni officials. Humayqani has provided financial support and other services to AQAP and acted for or on behalf of the group. He has represented AQAP in meetings with Yemeni officials to negotiate the release of Yemeni soldiers held by AQAP and worked with AQAP operatives to coordinate the movement of AQAP fighters within Yemen. Humayqani has directed a group of armed AQAP associates that intended to carry out attacks on Yemeni government facilities and institutions, including a Yemeni government building in al-Bayda Governorate. He has also recruited individuals in Sana, Yemen on behalf of AQAP in support of AQAP efforts in southern Yemen. Along with the U.S. and UN designated cleric Shaykh Abd al-Majid al-Zindani, he has issued religious guidance in support of AQAP operations. Humayqani and AQAP leadership have planned to establish a new political party in Yemen, which AQAP planned to use as a cover for the recruitment and training of fighters and a means to attract broader support. AQAP leadership decided that Humayani would play a public role as a leader and spokesman for the new political party.

The 59-year-old educator had a stellar résumé that included extensive fundraising experience and years of work with international human rights groups. But one apparent accomplishment was omitted from the list: According to U.S. officials, Nu’aymi also was working secretly as a financier for al-Qaeda, funneling millions of dollars to the terrorist group’s affiliates in Syria and Iraq even as he led campaigns in Europe for greater freedoms for Muslims. Nu’aymi was one of two men identified by Treasury Department officials last week as major financial backers of al-Qaeda and its regional chapters across the Middle East. Although U.S. officials routinely announce steps to disrupt terrorist financing networks, the individuals named in the latest case are far from ordinary. Both men have served as advisers to government-backed foundations in Qatar and have held high-profile positions with international human rights groups. The second man, a Yemeni, is heavily involved in his country’s U.S.-backed political transition. Their alleged dual roles — promoting humanitarian causes and civil rights while simultaneously supporting extremist groups — reflect a growing challenge for counterterrorism officials attempting to monitor the torrents of cash flowing to Islamist rebel groups in Syria, current and former U.S. officials say. “Individuals with one foot in the legitimate world and another in the realm of terrorist financing provide al-Qaeda with a cloak of legitimacy,” said Juan Zarate, a former Treasury Department official and author of “Treasury’s Wars,” a book that describes U.S. efforts to penetrate terrorist financial networks. Zarate said such cases greatly complicate the “financial diplomacy” involved in attempting to disrupt terrorist support networks, especially private funding from wealthy Persian Gulf donors seeking to help Syria’s rebels. Despite attempts by gulf states to crack down on jihadist financial networks, former and current U.S. officials have described a surge in private support for Islamist extremists in Syria, particularly in Qatar and Kuwait. The Obama administration has repeatedly urged both countries to rein in private donations to jihadists, while acknowledging that new tactics, including the widespread use of Twitter and other social media, make fundraising more difficult to track. “It is essential for countries to take proactive steps to disrupt terrorist financing, especially where al-Qaeda and its affiliates are concerned,” David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in announcing financial restrictions against Nu’aymi and the Yemeni national, Abd al-Wahhab al-Humayqani. Cohen said the Obama administration would continue to work with the gulf region’s capitals to “ensure that charitable donations are not used to support violence.” The administration’s action last week named both men as “specially designated global terrorists,” a determination that allows U.S. officials to freeze their financial assets and bar American citizens and companies from doing business with them. Treasury Department documents alleged that both men used their charity work to conceal efforts to raise millions of dollars for al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, from Syria to the Horn of Africa. The naming of the two officials raised eyebrows in Qatar and Yemen, where supporters viewed the allegations as politically motivated. Both men have been prominent critics of U.S. counter­terrorism policies, particularly the use of drone strikes against terrorism suspects. Nu’aymi, a Qatar University professor and former president of the Qatar Football Association, was a founding member of a prominent charity — the Sheik Eid bin Mohammad al-Thani Charitable Foundation, named for a member of the country’s ruling family. In recent years, Nu’aymi had gained renown as an international activist, serving as president of Alkarama, a Geneva-based human rights organization that works closely with the United Nations and major international activist groups to advocate for Muslims’ civil rights. Alkarama lobbies on behalf of Islamist detainees around the world, and it accuses Western and Arab governments of suppressing the rights of political groups that promote Islamic rule for the Middle East. Recently, the group has spoken out against U.S. drone strikes. Some of the group’s former clients are linked to Islamist militias seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Humayqani is an Alkarama founding member and onetime adviser to Qatar on charitable giving, according to his résumé. He is a founding member of Yemen’s conservative Rashad Union party and has served on the country’s National Dialogue Conference, a group established in the wake of the Arab Spring uprising to advise the government on political and economic reforms. The U.S. government strongly backs the National Dialogue with political and financial support. Nu’aymi, in a response posted on Twitter last week, said the U.S. allegations were in retaliation for his criticism of American policies, including drone strikes in Yemen and U.S. support for the recent overthrow of Egypt’s democratically elected government. He said the U.S. claims about his fundraising work were “far from the truth.” Humayqani was traveling and could not be reached for comment. A statement released by his Rashad Union party condemned what it called “false accusations” by the United States and urged Yemen’s government to rally to his defense. The allegations against Nu’aymi come at a time of increasing U.S. concern about the role of Qatari individuals and charities in supporting extreme elements within Syria’s rebel alliance. One charity, Madid Ahl al-Sham, was cited by Jabhat al-Nusra in August as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group, which has pledged loyalty to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If the oil fields were to dry up, it would result in less petroleum production. Since petroleum is the primary raw material for fuel used in engines, the amount of carbon dioxide produced by these engines would be significantly affected. The second effect mentioned in the process is 'engines produce carbon dioxide.' To understand how the reduction in petroleum production would impact the emission of carbon dioxide by engines, it's essential to analyze various factors involved. Let's break down the effects into the three proposed categories: more, less, and no effect. 1. Less Effect: With the decrease in petroleum availability, there would be a decline in fuel production for engines. Since engines are among the primary contributors to carbon dioxide emissions, one can expect a decrease in CO2 emissions due to the reduced operation of fossil fuel-based engines. Moreover, the demand for renewable and cleaner energy sources would likely increase, further helping to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, less carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere from engines, reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions. 2. More Effect: On the other hand, a sudden shortage of petroleum could lead to increased demand for alternative sources of fuel, such as coal, which could result in higher carbon dioxide emissions as these sources are less efficient than petroleum-based fuels. That being said, the trend towards renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions could counterbalance this potential risk and diminish its likelihood as the primary outcome. 3. No Effect: A 'no effect' scenario would be improbable, given that removing a significant source of fuel like petroleum would undoubtedly have some impact on the carbon dioxide emissions generated by engines. It is highly unlikely that alternative clean energy sources could meet the demand and completely offset the impact of reduced petroleum availability, and so there would be at least some effect on the emissions from engines. In conclusion, the drying up of oil fields would generally result in a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions that engines produce. However, the magnitude of the effect could vary depending on several factors such as the availability of alternative fuels, the pace of adopting renewable energy technologies, and the efficiency levels of alternative fuels. Based on the current global trajectory towards cleaner and renewable energy sources, the initial idea of less petroleum production leading to less carbon dioxide emissions is the most plausible scenario."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Within an observation period of up to 8 years (mean, 63.1 months) six patients with squamous cell carcinomas and three with basal cell carcinomas were observed. Eight of the nine tumor patients had been exposed to potential carcinogens such as arsenic and/or ionizing radiation prior to PUVA treatment. Five with squamous cell carcinomas were skin type I or II; in four of the six patients with squamous cell carcinomas the tumors were located on unexposed skin areas. The mean cumulative ultraviolet A (UVA) dose in three of the six squamous cell carcinoma patients was three times as high as that in the group of nontumor patients. The other three squamous cell carcinoma patients had lower mean doses than nontumor patients, as did the three patients with basal cell carcinomas. Although the cumulative UVA dose may eventually turn out to be relevant for PUVA carcinogenesis, our present data do not sufficiently substantiate a correlation between cumulative UVA dose and squamous cell carcinoma formation in PUVA-treated patients. This report confirms that previous exposure to carcinogens appears to be the most important factor for nonmelanoma skin tumor formation in long-term PUVA patients. Question: Does the abstract contain any numerical data? A:","output":"Yes, the abstract contains numerical data. Part #1: Presence of numerical data in the abstract Usage: The phrase \\"Two hundred ninety-seven long-term photochemotherapy (PUVA)-treated patients\\" is an example of numerical data, as it states the exact number of patients involved in the study. This meets the criteria because it provides a specific number that relates to an important aspect of the medical study. Part #2: Numerical data plays a key role in medical records Usage: The sentence \\"Within an observation period of up to 8 years (mean, 63.1 months) six patients with squamous cell carcinomas and three with basal cell carcinomas were observed.\\" contains important numerical data related to the length of the observation period and the number of patients affected by different types of carcinomas. This meets the criteria because it shows specific numerical data that is crucial for understanding the results of the study."},{"instruction":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","output":"Imagine you have a box of toys on the floor. A task to test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning could be asking them to stack the toys with the heaviest one on the bottom and the lightest one on the top. They would need to think about the size, weight, and shape of each toy, and figure out how to arrange them so they are stable and don't fall down. Remember, physical reasoning helps us understand how objects work in the world, just like how we know that heavy things should go at the bottom of a stack so it doesn't topple over!"},{"instruction":"In these two sentences (1) The Holocaust was insanity on an enormous scale. (2) The scale of the model., does the word scale mean the same thing?","output":"In these two sentences, the word \\"scale\\" is used in different contexts and carries different meanings. 1) In the first sentence, \\"The Holocaust was insanity on an enormous scale,\\" the term \\"scale\\" is used to describe the vastness or magnitude of a tragic event that took place during World War II, known as the Holocaust. In this context, \\"scale\\" refers to the size, extent, or level of something, which, in this case, is the extreme degree of human suffering and the systematic murder of approximately six million Jews, along with millions of others, by the Nazis. The term \\"scale\\" here conveys the enormity of the massacre, emphasizing the incomprehensible nature of the events that unfolded during this dark period in human history. In this sense, \\"scale\\" is an abstract concept that helps the reader understand the immense scope of the Holocaust and the level of \\"insanity\\" or irrationality that drove the systematic persecution and extermination of millions of people. 2) In the second sentence, \\"The scale of the model,\\" the word \\"scale\\" has a more concrete and specific meaning, as it refers to the proportion or ratio between the size of a model or replica and the actual object that it represents. In this context, \\"scale\\" indicates a direct relationship between two measurable quantities – in this case, size or dimensions. For example, if you have a 1:10 scale model of a car, it means that the model is ten times smaller than the actual car in every aspect (length, width, and height), serving as an accurate representation of the larger object, merely reduced in size. In this sense, \\"scale\\" is a measurable concept that helps us understand the relationship between the size of a model or replica and its real-world counterpart. In conclusion, while the word \\"scale\\" is present in both sentences, the meaning and context of the term differ significantly in each instance. In the first sentence, it conveys the idea of an immense scope or magnitude related to a tragic event, whereas in the second sentence, it refers to a proportional representation of an object's size in the form of a model or replica."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story.

Now do a next sentence writing task.","output":"Eric, who had initially been proud of his progress, found himself slipping back into his old habits as February rolled around, and he was disheartened by this regression. Although he was aware that the journey to a healthier lifestyle would be difficult, the allure of quick snacks and an indulgent lifestyle had been too strong for him to resist. As the months went by, Eric tried to regain the determination that he had displayed at the start of the year, but his motivation seemed to ebb and flow, with periods of strict dieting and consistent gym visits interspersed with periods of inactivity and unhealthy eating. Feeling frustrated, Eric began a search for ways to maintain his motivation and prevent himself from reverting back to his old way of living. In his quest, he stumbled upon an assortment of forums and support groups focused on promoting healthy lifestyles and weight loss, and he began to browse them in the hopes of finding inspiration. It was during this exploration that he discovered the idea of creating small, manageable goals and combining them with a reward system as a means of sustaining interest in his fitness journey. Eric was intrigued by this approach and decided to implement it in his own life; he sat down and made a list of short-term targets, each tailored to improve his overall well-being in some way. These included increasing his physical activity, decreasing his calorie intake, and incorporating more nutrient-dense foods into his diet. To keep himself accountable, he enlisted the help of a close friend to track their progress together, and he found that this shared experience lent a fresh burst of enthusiasm to his efforts. As the weeks went by, Eric noticed that his mindset began to shift – whereas previously the thought of a strict diet and intensive exercise regimen would cause him to feel dispirited and overwhelmed, now it was the smaller, achievable goals that painted a more attainable picture of success. He embraced this new perspective, and gradually, he began to notice tangible improvements: his stamina increased, his clothes fit more comfortably, and he felt proud of his progress. Still, Eric knew that one of the most significant challenges he faced lay in sustaining his efforts over the long term. To prevent complacency, he decided to introduce variety into his routine – trying out new workout regimes, experimenting with healthy recipes, and occasionally treating himself to a controlled indulgence to avoid feeling deprived. These changes allowed Eric to maintain his interest in the journey, and he found that, over time, his lifestyle modifications began to feel more like enjoyable habits rather than a chore. In reflection, Eric learned that the key to sticking to his diet and adopting a healthier lifestyle involved acknowledging that setbacks would occur, but that it was crucial to remain focused on smaller, achievable goals. By sharing his experience with others and incorporating variety into his routine, Eric was ultimately successful in not only adhering to his New Year's resolution but also in cultivating a genuine passion for living a healthier, more vibrant life."},{"instruction":"Data: Barny Cakes, country, France; France, leader, Gérard Larcher Sentence about the following data:","output":"Barny Cakes, a popular bakery in France, has been thriving under the nation's robust leadership.

The Presbyterian schism began with the controversy in relation to the Japanese shrine worship enforced during the Japanese colonial period and the establishment of a minor division (Koryu-pa, 고려파, later The Koshin Presbyterian Church in Korea, Koshin 고신) in 1952. And in 1953 the second schism happened when the theological orientation of the Chosun Seminary (later Hanshin University) founded in 1947 could not be tolerated in the PCK and another minor group (The Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea, Kijang, 기장) was separated. The last major schism had to do with the issue of whether the PCK should join the WCC. The controversy divided the PCK into two denominations, The Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap, 통합) and The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong, 합동) in 1959. All major seminaries associated with each denomination claim heritage from the Pyung Yang Theological Seminary, therefore, not only Presbyterian University and Theological Seminary and Chongsin University which are related to PCK but also Hanshin University of PROK all celebrated the 100th class in 2007, 100 years from the first graduates of Pyung Yang Theological Seminary.

Step 2: Confirm the correctness of the provided information. The provided information is an accurate representation of a typical legislative process, where the House of Representatives debates a bill and decides to either approve or reject it.

We are given several location options and we need to determine which one would be the most appropriate for an apple tree in the Northern region. 2. Let's assess each option: a) Alaska: Although it isn't impossible for apple trees to grow in Alaska, the extreme cold climate makes it difficult for apples to flourish, therefore making it less likely. b) Farm yard: In general, farm yards are suitable for cultivating apple trees, but we cannot determine the specific location only based on this description. c) Park: A park could be an appropriate location for an apple tree, as parks can encompass a range of climates, landscapes, and environments. However, the term \\"park\\" itself is quite vague and we don't have enough specific information to determine if it would be in a Northern region. d) Flowers: This isn't a location and therefore not a valid option. e) New Jersey: New Jersey is indeed in the Northern region of the United States. It has a temperate climate that is suitable for growing apple trees. 3. Based on the available information, New Jersey (option e) seems to be the most appropriate location for an apple tree in the North.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did. I was not an easy person to love. Why did the writer's wife leave him? - not enough information - The writer was too unpleasant and difficult to love. - She was unhappy in the marriage and met someone else who she fell in love with. - Her family persuaded her to do it. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it seems that there could be multiple reasons why the writer's wife left him. One possible reason is that the writer admits to being not an easy person to love, which might have made it difficult for his wife to be happy in the marriage. Another reason could be that she met someone else (the so-called friend) and fell in love with him, leading her to leave the marriage for a new relationship. It is also possible that the opinions of her family may have had an influence on her decision, but there is not enough information to confirm this. Overall, it seems that a combination of factors like the writer's difficult nature, her newfound relationship, and potentially her family's views contributed to the wife's decision to leave the marriage."},{"instruction":"Write a negative movie review.","output":"Once upon a time, I watched a movie that was not so good.

Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers. Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the Military Service Act in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of Military Service Tribunals to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916. The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. Recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy. Conscription lasted until mid-1919.

But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. and a hint : Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development.

Please answer this question : Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland?

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Aging is a natural process that occurs in all living organisms. It is an inevitable and unavoidable part of life that involves a gradual decline in biological functions and increases the risk of diseases and death. The underlying mechanisms of aging are complex and not yet fully understood. However, several factors contribute to aging, including genetic, epigenetic, and environmental influences, accumulation of cellular damages, and changes in metabolism. Researchers have been actively investigating the prospect of slowing down or even reversing aging in recent years. In some studies, it has been observed that certain interventions (such as caloric restriction, medications targeting specific aging pathways, and cellular reprogramming) may provide some benefits in delaying the onset of age-related diseases or extending the lifespan of certain organisms. However, it is essential to note that these findings are still in their early stages and, in some cases, are limited to non-human organisms. Moreover, the concept of completely stopping the aging process comes with ethical, social, and ecological concerns. If people could indeed stop aging, it would likely create complications regarding resource distribution, social dynamics, and the overall balance of the global ecosystem. While advancements in science and technology continue to progress in the field of aging research, it is important to recognize that, as of now, there is still no conclusive evidence or technology available that could stop the natural process of aging completely.

Article: Watching TV is a very popular pastime in the prefix = st1 /UKbut what kind of programmes do British people like to watch? Well, the most-watched TV programmes every week are very popular dramas that are usually on at least four times every week. They are dramas based in one neighbourhood that try to describe ordinary life in theUK--- we call these dramas 'soap operas' or 'soaps'. In the early days of TV, there were often dramas on during the day. Back in those days, it was traditional for the husband to go out to work and for the wife to stay at home and look after the house and the children. Most of these daytime dramas were aimed at entertaining the housewives who would traditionally be at home, probably doing the washing. Companies selling washing powder would advertise their products at times when these dramas were on, and sometimes those companies would even sponsor the drama. Hence the word 'soap'. So what about the word opera? Well, that's because these dramas are often an exaggeration of real life. They are supposed to represent ordinary life but to make them entertaining, lots of dramatic events like murders, divorces, affairs etc. all happen probably much more regularly than they would in a normal neighbourhood. Most soap operas these days are shown in the evening. Each show will have several different storylines happening at once that continue over several shows. The same _ will appear in every show too. There are lots of different soaps on in theUKon different channels but there are three main popular ones. 'Coronation Street' has been on since 1960. It is set in a suburb of Manchester and it's supposed to represent working class life in the north ofEngland.

It took a long time for Mary to heal from her fallout with Tanya as - Mary was just more sensitive.; - Tanya was just more sensitive.;","output":"It took a long time for Mary to heal from her fallout with Tanya as not only was Mary more naturally sensitive, she was also deeply affected by the rift that had formed between her and her close friend. So many shared memories, dreams, and goals now seemed to be tainted by the bitter taste of conflict, making the healing process prolonged and emotionally draining. Additionally, Tanya's own sensitive nature only served to complicate matters further. Mary's increased sensitivity was a core component of her personality; a trait that had been with her from a young age. For her, friendships and relationships carried with them a sense of emotional security, and the loss of this security following her fallout with Tanya left her feeling vulnerable and exposed. This made it even more difficult for Mary to reconcile her feelings and move forward. Her efforts towards self-care and healing were often undermined by the pain she felt when reminded of their happier times together, as she struggled to let go of these cherished memories. At the same time, Tanya's heightened sensitivity only made it harder for Mary to find the closure she sought. Even though Tanya perhaps did not experience the same level of emotional turmoil as Mary, her own sensitivity fueled misconceptions about Mary's intentions and efforts towards reconciliation. This led to more misunderstandings and miscommunications between the two, which only strained their already damaged relationship further. Tanya's guardedness and reluctance to accept Mary's olive branches may have been rooted in her own fears and insecurities, and her sensitivity to both the pain caused by their fallout and the potential for future emotional harm left her hesitant and unwilling to take the necessary steps towards healing their friendship. The fragility of both Mary and Tanya's emotions served to create a landscape of uncertainty and confusion, where both parties struggled to navigate the path towards forgiveness and healing. Caught between feeling abandoned and hurt, and the longing to restore their once-strong bond, they were faced with the monumentally challenging task of rediscovering trust and redefining the very nature of their friendship. Ultimately, the story of Mary and Tanya's fallout highlights the vulnerability and complexities that arise within human relationships, and in particular, how sensitivity can both enrich and complicate our lives. As they embarked on their long and arduous journey towards healing, Mary and Tanya would be forced to examine not only the nature of their conflict, but also to reflect deeply upon themselves and their emotional needs. By confronting these challenging aspects of their personalities and friendship, they could ultimately seek growth and understanding, and potentially, offer an opportunity for new and stronger bonds to be forged in the process."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Hi, I'm Li Ping.

After undertaking a year of medical internship, Fisher served as an emergency room physician prior to joining NASA. The space first held by Anna Fisher relates to her historic designation as the first mother in space. Among her numerous accomplishments, this stands out as a particularly impressive one. Dr. Fisher's historic space flight took place from November 8-16, 1984, aboard Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-51A). She thus achieved the feat of becoming the first mother to travel to space, breaking new ground not just for women but for all parents, showcasing that even the most complex and demanding jobs could be undertaken while raising a family. During her mission, Fisher performed as the mission specialist. Along with four other crew members, she engaged in various tasks, including the deployment of two satellites: Canada's ANIK D-2 and the American Satellite Company's LEASAT 1. Furthermore, Fisher expertly operated the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), allowing her to retrieve Westar 6 and Palapa B-2 satellites that were malfunctioning—pioneering the implementation of satellite retrieval and repair missions. After her groundbreaking space flight, Fisher continued working with NASA. She participated in project reviews, researched and developed software, and provided technical support during the Space Shuttle-Mir Program. Fisher also played an essential role in the development of the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) whose goal was to support NASA's deep space exploration missions. Anna Fisher retired from NASA in April 2017, concluding a remarkable 39-year career that made her an inspiration to many. By achieving her space first of becoming the first mother in space, Dr. Fisher broke through barriers, pushing the boundaries of what was considered possible not only for women but also for parents pursuing demanding careers in any field. Her impact on space exploration, gender equality, and the pursuit of groundbreaking projects leaves a lasting legacy for generations to come."},{"instruction":"It was another landmark week in the presidency of Donald Trump. He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference. Trump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation. There were, however, some significant setbacks as well, including the withdrawal of Ronny Jackson as the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs and intense congressional...

While Samuel had children, Hunter did not, so","output":"Samuel had children, but his friend Hunter didn't. You see, children are like tiny people who are just learning and growing. Samuel loved being a father, which means he took care of his children, helped them learn new things, and spent time with them. Hunter, on the other hand, was a person who didn't have any children yet. He still had friends and family, and he liked spending time with them too! Sometimes he would go over to Samuel's house and play with Samuel's children, because even though Hunter didn't have his own kids, he still liked being around them. One day, Samuel and Hunter decided to take the children to the park. The park is a fun place where kids can play on swings, slides, and other fun equipment. They thought it would be a nice day to enjoy the sunshine and have a little adventure. At the park, Samuel's children played on the swings, pumped their little legs to go higher, and whooshed through the air. They raced over to the slides, climbed up, and then slid down with happy giggles. Hunter watched them and smiled, seeing how much fun they were having. Samuel and Hunter also played a game of catch with the kids, running around and throwing a soft, squishy ball back and forth. Samuel's children sometimes called Hunter \\"Uncle Hunter\\" even though he wasn't really their uncle, but just a close friend of their dad. Hunter liked that because it made him feel special and a part of their family. Later, they all sat down on a big blanket under a tree and ate a picnic lunch together. They shared sandwiches, fruits, and yummy cookies that Samuel's children helped to make. They all laughed and talked, enjoying each other's company and the nice day at the park. When it was time to go home, Samuel's children gave Hunter big hugs and thanked him for a fun day. Although Hunter didn't have children of his own, he felt lucky to have such a wonderful friend like Samuel and to be an \\"uncle\\" to his children. And who knows, maybe one day Hunter would have his own little ones to play with too!

A:","output":"To answer this question, let me first gather some information about Rastafarianism and their religious texts. Step 1: Identify Rastafarianism as a religious movement Rastafarianism is a religious and cultural movement that emerged in Jamaica in the 1930s. It is based on the worship of the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, who Rastafarians believe is a divine figure like Jesus Christ and the messiah incarnate. Step 2: Determine the primary religious text of Rastafarians Rastafarians use the Bible as their primary religious text, specifically the King James Version (KJV) or the Authorized Version. Step 3: Understand the Rastafarian interpretation of the Bible While Rastafarians use the KJV of the Bible, they have a unique interpretation of its content. They emphasize certain themes and passages, such as the Book of Revelation, which they believe contain prophecies about the Rastafarian movement and the fall of oppressive powers in the world. Step 4: Highlight the Rastafarian focus on African elements in the Bible In addition to their unique interpretation of the Bible, Rastafarians also focus on the African elements present in the text. For example, they believe that the biblical figures King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba were ancestors of Emperor Haile Selassie, and that the original Garden of Eden was located in Africa. So, to answer the original question: Rastafarians use the King James Version of the Bible as their primary religious text, with a distinct interpretation and focus on African elements within the scripture."},{"instruction":"Vikram Solanki beat the rain clouds to register his second one-day international century as England won the third one-day international to wrap up a series victory.

The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25.

Guided by the visions of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), apparently remnants of his shared consciousness with Merlin, SG-1 searches for the ark. They fly the Odyssey through the supergate to the Ori galaxy. Accompanying them are Marrick (Currie Graham), a representative of the IOA, the international body that oversees the Stargate program, and Tomin (Tim Guinee), a renegade commander of the Ori forces. Tomin, like Teal'c (Christopher Judge) in the early seasons of Stargate SG-1, is tormented by the wrongs he did for his evil masters. Teal'c pitilessly tells Tomin that Tomin will never forgive himself, but he must nevertheless work to help others.Working on a tip from the anti-Ori resistance, SG-1 beams down to the Ori planet Celestis to look for the ark, but Lt. Cols. Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Mitchell (Ben Browder) return to the Odyssey when they learn that Marrick has locked himself in with the Asgard core, an advanced system installed by Earth's Asgard allies. Before they can get to him, Marrick installs a chip in the core and launches a program that synthesizes a Replicator. (Replicators are self-replicating machines that try to take over any ship or world they encounter.) The Replicator, naturally, escapes into the ship, while Marrick explains that the IOA never believed that SG-1 would find the ark. Unleashing Replicators is the IOA's plan to defeat the Ori's followers.While Carter and Mitchell struggle with the Replicators for control of the Odyssey, Jackson, Teal'c, Vala (Claudia Black), and Tomin descend into a system of tunnels pointed out to Jackson by Merlin. They find the ark, but before they can return to the beleaguered Odyssey, the Asgard core attracts several Ori motherships. The Odyssey jumps to hyperspace to escape, leaving the party on Celestis behind -- along with the ark. The ark and all but Teal'c are captured and taken...

It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida. - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS. - The expansion card (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. - Columbia Data Products (CDP) is a company that produced some of the first IBM PC clones. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company. - Clean room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions. - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s. - The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a \\"de facto\\" standard. - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Compaq Computer Corporation was a company founded in 1982 that developed , sold , and supported computers and related products and services . Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers , being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer . It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001 . Struggling in the aftermath of the dot - com bubble bust , Compaq was acquired for US 25 billion by HP in 2002 . The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower - end systems until 2013 when , without warning , the Compaq name was quietly discontinued . The company was formed by Rod Canion , Jim Harris and Bill Murto -- former Texas Instruments senior managers . Murto ( SVP of Sales ) departed Compaq in 1987 , while Canion ( President and CEO ) and Harris ( SVP of Engineering ) left under a shakeup in 1991 , which saw Eckhard Pfeiffer appointed President and CEO . Pfeiffer served through the 1990s . Ben Rosen provided the venture capital financing for the fledgling company and served as chairman of the board for 18 years from 1983 until September 28 , 2000 , when he retired and was succeeded by Michael Capellas , who served as the last Chairman and CEO until its merger with HP. Prior to its takeover the company was headquartered in a facility in northwest unincorporated Harris County , Texas , that now continues as HP 's largest United States facility . What entity does 'compaq' has the relation 'industry' with? Answer:","output":"Compaq has the relation 'industry' with the computer industry, specifically the development, production, sales, and support of computers and related products and services."},{"instruction":"Yes, a tap dancing horror thriller........with Shelley and Debbie!

One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food.

Context: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

The highway that cut through the countryside is the correct answer because: 1. Countryside usually refers to rural areas with vast open spaces, farmland, and natural landscapes, making it a more suitable option for a scenic route. 2. United States is incorrect because it's a broad term referring to an entire country, not a specific kind of landscape. 3. Beach is not appropriate because a highway cutting through a beach wouldn't be typical, and it doesn't encompass the diverse views people may look for in a scenic route. 4. Atlas is incorrect since it's a book of maps or a collection of geographical information, not a type of terrain or landscape. 5. Developed land refers to urbanized areas, which often lack the natural beauty and diverse landscapes associated with scenic routes.

For best results, use crushed ice or small pebble ice instead of large ice cubes. Dump the flavored syrup into the glass, pouring it evenly over the ice already inside. You can use either commercially prepared beverage syrups or homemade syrups. When using commercial syrups packaged in a pump bottle, adding two to four pumps of syrup usually provides the right amount of flavor. If you've made standard Italian soda before, use the same amount of syrup for an Italian cream (French) soda. If you're starting with this drink, then you'll need to experiment a little. Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) for a milder flavor and up to 4 Tbsp (60 ml) for a stronger, sweeter taste. Use any syrup flavor you want. For a twist, you can even combine syrup flavors. Add equal parts of both syrups when combining two flavors. Some combinations that work well include: banana and Irish cream, strawberry and coconut, raspberry and almond, and peach and vanilla. Add the club soda to the glass. Do not fill the glass completely; leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of empty space in between the top of the club soda and the top of the glass. Pour the half and half over the contents of the glass. Slowly stir it in until the color of the soda softens throughout the entire glass. Do not stir the contents of the glass too much since doing so can cause the soda to become flat. Only stir the French soda a few times, just enough to spread the half and half through the top two-thirds to three-quarters of the glass. For a slightly different variation, add the half and half before adding the club soda. Adding the half and half after the soda is more traditional and allows the half and half to spread gradually, creating a smoother drink. Adding the half and half before adding the soda will create a foamier beverage. If you don't have half and half, combine equal parts heavy cream and whole milk. Stir the two ingredients together in a separate dish before adding the mixture to the glass. Use almond milk if you need a dairy-free alternative to half and half. Drink the French soda (also known as an Italian cream soda) immediately, before the ice can melt and water down the taste. Consider garnishing the glass with pieces of fruit or fresh mint. Whipped cream can be added, as well. Summary:","output":"To make a yummy drink called French soda, first fill a big cup halfway with small ice. Then, pour tasty syrup over the ice - you can use one flavor or mix two together. Next, add fizzy club soda, but not too much, leaving some space at the top of the cup. After that, pour some half and half (or something similar) and gently mix it. Be careful not to mix it too much, or you'll lose the fizz. Finally, enjoy your pretty drink, and you can add fun things like fruit, mint, or whipped cream on top!"},{"instruction":"In this task, you will be shown a passage.

Barros Schelotto played 16 years of his professional career in the Argentine Primera Division (6 with Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata and 10 with Boca Juniors). With these two teams, he won a total 17 official titles (one with Gimnasia and 16 with Boca). In 2007, Barros Schelotto left Boca Juniors for Columbus Crew in the Major League Soccer, therefore having his first experience outside his native country. Born with a twin brother, Gustavo, Barros Schelotto was hence nicknamed El Mellizo (\\"the twin\\"). He started playing professionally at the end of 1991 with his hometown team Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata, where he scored 45 goals in 181 matches in five seasons and in 1993 won the AFA Centenario Cup. On 14 September 1997 he transferred to Primera Division Argentina powerhouse Boca Juniors, for whom he played for almost 10 years. He was considered an idol by Boca fans and in his later years at the club showed his experience whenever he stepped on the pitch. Barros Schelotto remains one of Boca's top scorers in international matches with 25 goals, just one goal behind former teammate Martin Palermo. In 1996, he was offered to play for River Plate, but after club icon Enzo Francescoli was not happy with the potential signing, the deal collapsed. In mid-1997, Boca Juniors showed interest for him and his brother Gustavo. It was like that that Barros Schelotto twins arrived to Boca teaming up to a former rival: Martin Palermo, Gimnasia's archrival Estudiantes de La Plata former player. The three of them were repeatedly recommended to Boca by Diego Maradona, who was playing his last season for the Buenos Aires team, retiring on October the same year. Once in Boca, he made his debut as a substitute for Claudio Caniggia, scoring on 14 September 1997 against Newell's Old Boys in a 2-1 victory. With Carlos Bianchi as Boca Juniors' coach, Barros Schelotto got his traditional 7 shirt and kept it until 2006-07 season. He and former rival Martin Palermo became a successful attacking duo, who highly contributed in the 1998-99 title-winning season. He missed the 2001 and 2003 clubs international achievements due to injuries. In 2003, he was a key piece in the winning Copa Libertadores side, with his peak performance at the Round of 16 match against Brazilian team Paysandu, where he scored a hat-trick and assisted Marcelo Delgado's goal. In the second half of 2003 he again suffered from injuries and could only play for 46 minutes in the Copa Intercontinental winning match against AC Milan, when he replaced Carlos Tevez. With Alfio Basile as Boca coach, his participation in the first team was gradually lowering. He even was out of some first team matches and had to play for the second team to maintain his performance level. He scored 87 goals in 302 games for Boca Juniors. when did he start playing soccer in argentina?","output":"He started playing professionally at the end of 1991 with his hometown team Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata."},{"instruction":"Translate from Spanish to English: Ahora bien, algunos consideran que el auge de otros países y nuestras dificultades económicas internas son indicios de que el poder de Estados Unidos ha disminuido.

I tried to place the grocery bag in the basket on the bike, but the","output":"bag was too big and cumbersome. The bag was filled with a collection of essential items such as milk, bread, and eggs, as well as a few treats I had decided to indulge in, like a box of cookies and a tub of ice cream. The sun was bright and warm, a gentle breeze slightly cooling my face as I puzzled over the situation. I considered the options that I had at my disposal. I could either fit a few items into the basket and carry the rest in the bag, balanced precariously on my handlebars, or I could make another trip. Doing the latter seemed arduous and time-consuming, considering that the store wasn't exactly close to home. The decision wasn't easy, but I finally concluded that I needed to find a middle ground by consolidating the items. Carefully, I took out the loaves of bread and tried placing them vertically in the basket, hoping to create space for the rest of the items. To my delight, the plan worked, and it allowed me to place the milk carton and cookie box in the still-cramped basket. I wrapped the eggs in a newspaper, placed them gently on top of bread, and was finally able to fit everything in the basket. My only dilemma now was the tub of ice cream, which had already started to melt in the warm sunlight. Time was of the essence, so I quickly weighed my remaining options. I had my backpack with me, which was filled with my laptop and a few books. However, I realized that if I could just make enough room for the ice cream in the backpack, I could potentially save it from turning into a soupy mess. Determined, I opened up the backpack and relocated some of my books to the basket, creating a dent in the bag. I nestled the tub of ice cream in the middle, zipped the bag tight to keep in the cold, and strapped it onto my back. Feeling confident in my problem-solving skills, I began to pedal, the breeze now feeling even more refreshing against my skin. Soon enough, I found myself lost in the rhythm of my journey, every rotation of the bicycle wheels bringing me closer to home. The largely empty streets made for a smooth ride, a luxury at this hour as people were either at work or school, leaving the roads wide and free of any congestion. I slowed down occasionally, taking in the beauty of the old houses lined along with neatly trimmed hedges, the bright flowers in full bloom, and the distant laughter of children playing in a nearby park. As I approached the final stretch, my thoughts wandered to the reward I could indulge in once I got home—a big scoop of that delicious ice cream. The excitement propelled me to pedal even faster, and before long, I arrived at my destination. Fumbling with my keys, I unlocked the door and almost dashed into the kitchen, the grocery bag swinging from the bike's basket. With an unbridled enthusiasm, I unpacked everything, grabbing the tub of ice cream last. I nearly gasped with relief when I found that, despite the heat of the sun, my quick thinking had saved my dessert from an untimely demise. With a sense of accomplishment, I scooped out a generous portion of the ice cream and sank into my favorite armchair. The sun still dappled the garden outside, casting golden shadows on the living room floor, and the faint, comforting sounds of the bustling world beyond my sanctuary brought a sense of peace. As I savored the taste of the ice cream, I reflected on the little adventure I had just embarked upon. It seemed silly, but it had been the perfect reminder that sometimes, the simplest of challenges can lead to the most rewarding moments. And so, I relished every bite, the sweet, cold cream leaving behind a satisfying taste of victory."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and category of the product based on the review given by the user and your task is classify whether the given category match the review.

In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

Watch your fish for unusual swimming patterns. Take a close look at your goldfish's fins and scale. Check if there's anything on your fish that wasn't there before. Pay close attention to your fish’s eyes. Make sure your goldfish is eating. Article:","output":"Title: The Importance of Monitoring Your Goldfish's Health: Key Aspects to Keep an Eye Out For Introduction Goldfish, as adorable and low-maintenance as they may seem, still require plenty of care and attention to maintain their health and well-being. As a responsible goldfish owner, it is crucial to be aware of any changes in your fish's behavior and appearance, as these could indicate underlying health issues. In this article, we will discuss some essential aspects you should focus on while monitoring your goldfish's health, including swimming patterns, fins and scales, eyes and ensuring they are eating well. 1. Goldfish Staying Close to the Surface One of the first signs that your goldfish may be experiencing some health issues is if it frequently stays close to the water's surface. When a goldfish consistently lingers near the top, it can often signify a lack of oxygen in the tank, which can lead to stress and other complications. Moreover, this behavior can also indicate some discomfort in their swim bladder, affecting their buoyancy control. To address these issues, make sure to regularly test the water quality and provide adequate aeration in the tank. Additionally, consult your veterinarian or an aquatic expert on the possible remedies for swim bladder issues. 2. Unusual Swimming Patterns Goldfish are usually active swimmers that gracefully navigate their surroundings. If your fish starts exhibiting unusual swimming patterns, like swimming in circles, erratic movements, or consistently swimming upside-down, it could be an indication of a health problem. These abnormal behaviors could result from stress, poor water quality, infections, and internal parasites. To prevent these issues, ensure you maintain a clean and well-balanced tank environment, be mindful of any new additions to the tank, and promptly address any factors that could contribute to stress for your fish. 3. Fins and Scales Regularly inspect your goldfish's fins and scales for any visible changes. Healthy fins should be smooth, intact, and free from any fraying or tears. Clamped fins or any discoloration may suggest stress or infections. On the other hand, scales should possess a healthy, metallic shine and a smooth appearance. Swollen or protruding scales can indicate a condition called dropsy, where the goldfish retains fluids due to organ failure or bacterial infection. Immediate medical attention is required for such cases, as dropsy can be fatal if left untreated. 4. New Additions on the Fish As you examine your goldfish's appearance, pay attention to any foreign objects, growths, or blemishes that were not previously present. These additions might include small white specks, fungus-like growths, or ulcers on the fish's body. Each of these conditions can have different causes, ranging from common goldfish diseases to parasite infestations. Make sure to consult a professional for proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations if these symptoms are present. 5. Fish’s Eyes A goldfish's eyes should be clean, bright, and free from any cloudiness or bulging. Cloudy eyes are often a sign of poor water quality or bacterial infections, while bulgy or protruding eyes can be indicative of injury, fluid retention, or more serious conditions like popeye disease. Address the underlying issues contributing to these eye-related symptoms, including improving water quality or consulting a veterinarian for professional advice. 6. Ensure Your Goldfish is Eating Goldfish generally have hearty appetites. If your goldfish suddenly shows disinterest in food, it could be due to stress, illnesses, or overfeeding. Observe their eating habits and maintain a balanced and varied diet for the fish. Consult a veterinarian if the goldfish continues to refuse food or loses weight. Conclusion Goldfish are delicate creatures that require regular monitoring to maintain their overall health. As a responsible goldfish owner, it is essential to stay attentive to any changes in your fish's appearance or behavior, as these can be early warning signs of potential health issues. By providing a clean, well-maintained environment, a balanced diet, and prompt attention to health concerns, you can significantly improve your goldfish's quality of life and ensure they remain healthy, happy companions for years to come."},{"instruction":"Given a piece of financial news and its polarity, classify it into 'true' if the polarity is correct and classify into 'false' if the polarity is incorrect.

Their properties and behavior are quite different from those of metals on the left side. Under normal conditions, more than half of the nonmetals are gases, one is a liquid, and the rest include some of the softest and hardest of solids. The nonmetals exhibit a rich variety of chemical behaviors. They include the most reactive and least reactive of elements, and they form many different ionic and covalent compounds. This section presents an overview of the properties and chemical behaviors of the nonmetals, as well as the chemistry of specific elements. Many of these nonmetals are important in biological systems. In many cases, trends in electronegativity enable us to predict the type of bonding and the physical states in compounds involving the nonmetals. We know that electronegativity decreases as we move down a given group and increases as we move from left to right across a period. The nonmetals have higher electronegativities than do metals, and compounds formed between metals and nonmetals are generally ionic in nature because of the large differences in electronegativity between them. The metals form cations, the nonmetals form anions, and the resulting compounds are solids under normal conditions. On the other hand, compounds formed between two or more nonmetals have small differences in electronegativity between the atoms, and covalent bonding—sharing of electrons—results. These substances tend to be molecular in nature and are gases, liquids, or volatile solids at room temperature and pressure. In normal chemical processes, nonmetals do not form monatomic positive ions (cations) because their ionization energies are too high. All monatomic nonmetal ions are anions; examples include the chloride ion, Cl−, the nitride ion, N3−, and the selenide ion, Se2−. The common oxidation states that the nonmetals exhibit in their ionic and covalent compounds are shown in Figure 18.19. Remember that an element exhibits a positive...

This is what holds your homework up. Maybe your little sisters drawings are hung on the fridge in this manner. Do magnets stick to all materials? Of course not. You have probably checked and they do not stick to other surfaces. They do not stick to wooden doors or glass windows. Wood and glass are not attracted to a magnet. Obviously, only certain materials are attracted to magnets. Do you have any questions?","output":"Magnetism is a fascinating phenomenon observed in various materials and has both practical and scientific applications. You mentioned refrigerator magnets as an everyday example of magnetism. These magnets interact with certain types of metal surfaces, such as the iron content in steel, which is the primary material used in most refrigerators. Not all materials are attracted to magnets; they can be broadly classified into three categories based on their magnetic properties: 1. Ferromagnetic materials: These materials, such as iron, cobalt, and nickel, exhibit strong magnetic properties in the presence of an external magnetic field. They can become permanently magnetized and have a high degree of interaction with magnets. 2. Paramagnetic materials: These materials, like aluminum and platinum, show weak magnetic properties in the presence of an external magnetic field, but they do not retain magnetic properties when the field is removed. Their interaction with magnets is generally not noticeable in everyday situations, and they do not stick to magnets like ferromagnetic materials do. 3. Diamagnetic materials: Materials like copper, silver, and gold are weakly repelled by an external magnetic field, but this effect is typically too subtle to notice without specialized equipment. These materials are not attracted to magnets at all. As you mentioned, magnets don't stick to certain materials, such as wood or glass. This is because they do not have any significant magnetic properties – they are essentially non-magnetic materials. Applications of magnetism are numerous, spanning various industries and technologies. For instance, magnets are used in electronic devices, such as hard drives and speakers, as well as in electric motors and generators. In the medical field, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relies on the principles of magnetism to produce detailed images of the human body. Additionally, magnetic forces are harnessed for transportation purposes in magnetic levitation (maglev) trains. In conclusion, magnetism is a fundamental force that plays a critical role in many aspects of our lives, from basic household objects like refrigerator magnets to advanced technological applications. The various properties and interactions of magnetic materials provide a versatile and powerful tool, enabling the development of new devices and scientific advancements."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A woman in a black dress stands in a city street.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A woman is standing by a city street.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Article: Bill Javis took over our village news-agency at a time of life when most of us only want to relax. He just thought he would like something but not too much to do, and the news-agency was ready-made. The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile. He lived in a flat above the shop, alone. Except in the very bad weather, you always knew where to find him in the afternoon, as I have said. Once, on a sunny afternoon, I walked home along the river bank from a shopping trip to the village. By my watch it was three minutes past four, so I was astonished to see Bill sitting there on his little chair with a line in the water. He had had no luck, I could see, but he was making no effort to move. \\"What's wrong, Bill?\\" I called out from the path. For answer, he put a hand in his jacket and took out a big, golden object. For a moment I had no idea what it could be, and then it suddenly went off with a noise like a fire engine. Stopping the bell, Bill held the thing up and called back, \\"Ten to four, you see, and this is dead right.\\" I had never known anyone carrying a brass alarm clock round with him before.

Identify the context: The word \\"perversity\\" is presented without any additional context or surrounding words. It stands alone as a single-word sentence. 2. Determine the meaning of the word: \\"Perversity\\" refers to a deliberate and stubborn desire to behave in a way that is unreasonable or unacceptable, often despite the consequences. It can have negative connotations and is often associated with rebellion, disobedience, or immorality. 3. Evaluate the sentiment: Based on the meaning of \\"perversity,\\" the sentiment could be considered negative or unfavorable, as it suggests disobedience, immorality, or unreasonableness. 4. Consider the limitations of the analysis: Since there is no additional context provided, it's important to note that the sentence could be perceived differently based on the context in which it is presented. The word \\"perversity\\" on its own does not provide any clear indication of the intended sentiment or emotion behind the sentence. In conclusion, based on the meaning of the word \\"perversity\\" and the lack of context, the sentiment of this sentence would likely be perceived as negative or unfavorable. However, additional context might change this perception."},{"instruction":"Is it possible to conclude that \\"The mother with two son are swimming in the sea.\\" if \\"two boys are swimming while the mom is tanning on the beach\\"?","output":"No, it is not appropriate or logically consistent to conclude that \\"The mother with two sons are swimming in the sea\\", if the provided statement is \\"Two boys are swimming while the mom is tanning on the beach.\\" The two sentences give us different situations on what the characters in them are doing. In the first sentence, \\"The mother with two sons are swimming in the sea\\" suggests that the mother and her two sons are all in the sea, doing the action of swimming. This paints the picture of a family enjoying their time in the water together. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Two boys are swimming while the mom is tanning on the beach\\" provides information of the boys swimming but the mother is not included in the swimming activity. Instead, she is said to be tanning on the beach, which is a different action in a different location. This suggests that while her sons are in the water, the mother is on the beach, likely watching them and/or enjoying the sun. In order for the conclusion to align with the given information, the actions of the individuals and their locations must correspond accurately. Therefore, based on the initial statement, one could say: \\"The two boys are swimming in the sea while their mother is nearby on the beach, tanning.\\" This sentence preserves the actions and locations provided earlier. In conclusion, since the activities and locations specified in both sentences differ, the conclusion that \\"The mother with two sons are swimming in the sea\\" from the statement \\"two boys are swimming while the mom is tanning on the beach\\" would be incorrect and misleading.

We were able to find the corn crops but not the maze since the","output":"directions we received turned out to be quite ambiguous. The sun was setting, casting a beautiful orange glow over the fields, and the air carried the sweet scent of freshly cultivated soil. Our group of friends had been so excited about the idea of exploring a corn maze, and now we feared that our enthusiasm might lead us astray. The map we had been given at the local farmer's market seemed well-detailed at first glance, but as we followed the narrow dirt path, the twists and turns seemed to make no sense at all. The trees that lined the edge of the field cast long, eerie shadows, making it difficult to discern the boundaries of the cornfields. It didn't help that the wind whispered through the crops, creating a low, haunting melody. That, combined with the encroaching darkness, only served to increase our uneasiness. Determined not to let this adventure go to waste, we decided to split into pairs and search for any signs of the elusive corn maze. We agreed on a meeting point and set a time for everyone to reconvene. With a renewed sense of purpose, we ventured forth into the golden waves of corn. My partner and I, armed with flashlights and our unreliable map, delved deeper into the fields. The towering stalks rustled around us, and I couldn't help but feel a mixture of excitement and trepidation. We fought back the urge to call out to our friends, wanting to maintain an air of mystery and independence. As the minutes ticked by, we began to notice strange markings on some of the cornstalks. At first, we assumed it was just the work of playful hands, but soon we found more intricate patterns carved on the plants. They appeared to be ancient symbols, similar to the ones often found in forgotten caves and burial sites. The carvings seemed to be leading us on a specific path, and our intrigue grew with each discovery. When we finally emerged from the cornfields, we found ourselves in an enchanting clearing. The moon cast its silvery light upon a circular labyrinth, created by tall, elaborately decorated hedges. It was an unexpected find, but it seemed to be the very corn maze we had been searching for. The sense of mystery deepened as we realized the striking similarities between the symbols found on the cornstalks and those adorning the hedges of the labyrinth. Reuniting with our friends, we exchanged stories about our respective discoveries and reveled in our success of unearthing the hidden maze. The whispers of the wind in the cornfields seemed to feel more like encouragement than caution now. Together, we embarked on our journey through the maze, armed with nothing but our camaraderie and the dim glow of our flashlights. As the night wore on, we navigated through the twists and turns of the labyrinth, solving riddles and following clues left by the mysterious artist who had adorned the cornfields and hedges with their enigmatic symbols. When we finally reached the heart of the maze, it was dawn, and the first light of the rising sun flooded the clearing. We emerged victorious, not just as a group of friends who conquered an incredible challenge, but also as curious souls who unraveled the secrets and magic of a once-hidden world. Although the story of finding the corn maze would forever be etched in our memories, we could never quite explain how it came to be or who created the mysterious symbols that guided us there. But, perhaps, some things are better left as unsolved mysteries; a reminder of the awe-inspiring beauty and wonder that life has to offer when we embark on adventures with open hearts and minds."},{"instruction":"Kimberly Jonathan \\"Kim\\" Hyde was a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Home and Away, played by Chris Hemsworth.

The monastery is currently inactive. The fortress played a major role in protecting the north-western regions of Armenia (Gugark) and is among the most well preserved of all in modern Armenia. The main church at the compound is famous for its highly artistic frescoes, which cover the inside walls, the partitions, and the bearings of the building. The modern name of Akhtala was first recorded in a royal decree of 1438. The etymology of the name \\"Akhtala\\" is believed to be of Turkic origin, meaning \\"white glade\\". The original Armenian name of the settlement where the monastery is built is Pghindzahank, which means \\"copper mine\\". - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe.

Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Spitak, is a town in the northern Lori Province of Armenia.

Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte. After reading the above, is \\"Japanese\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What are some of the languages are now spoken by employees of the NLS?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"Japanese\\" is the correct answer to the question, as the text indicates that Neighborhood Legal Services (NLS) has expanded their capacity to include staff who are proficient in a number of Asian languages including Japanese. The text details how NLS, an organization dedicated to providing free legal services to the economically disadvantaged, has broadened its presence in the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys where there is a significant Asian population. The non-English speaking Asian population traditionally faced several barriers to accessing such services including language limitations, cultural isolation, and the legal service providers' own lack of cultural expertise. However, in response to the particular needs of these communities, NLS has sought to enhance its language capabilities as part of its service expansion. As NLS executive director, Neal Dubovitz, specified, there was an objective to increase language diversity comparable to the Spanish-English bilingual capability which is now common in their legal offices. This expansion incentive gave rise to the hiring of around 13 attorneys capable of speaking different Asian languages. Attorney Rebecca Yee lists these languages as Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Tagalog. One case illustrates Family Law Attorney Irene Mak who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, and Thai and was hired to work on domestic violence cases. Mak's own experience, her zeal to serve the Asian community, along with her language skills, epitomize the broader goal of the NLS; to diversify and expand their services to cater to diverse communities and cultures. Therefore, with the inclusion of Japanese-speaking staff as a part of their expansion, NLS has made an important step towards enhancing accessibility and inclusivity in their services for the Asian communities in the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys. So, \\"Japanese\\" is indeed a correct reference to the languages now spoken by employees of the NLS."},{"instruction":"If \\"A guy is reading a book and sitting on the floor.\\" does that mean that \\"A guy is looking at book while sitting inside.\\"?

Article: Everyone tries to get to school on time. But when bad weather gives you trouble, can you still make it before the bell rings? In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms?

Williams CNN Editor's note: Umbria Communications collects and analyzes postings from millions of weblogs to find out what is being discussed in the blogosphere and who is engaging in discussion. Gas prices rose more than 50 cents over the 12 week period. (CNN) -- Surging gas prices have sparked debates at the water cooler, on Wall Street and in the halls of Congress, and Internet researchers say it's also a hot topic in the blogosphere. The marketing research firm Umbria Communications, in partnership with CNN.com, studied blog postings published between the weeks of March 12 and May 28, and found that the number of mentions of gas prices increased by more than 45 percent -- from 4,032 mentions/million posts to 5,865 mentions/million. To put those numbers in perspective, the XBox -- Microsoft's popular gaming system -- got 11,053 mentions/million in a recent week, while eBay got 7,310 mentions/million and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had 1,439 mentions/million. (See charts from Umbria) The increase in mentions tended to follow the change in gas prices, which rose about 50 cents during that period, but there were some spikes in the discussion. The number jumped to 8,421 mentions/million during the week ending May 7, the week after Senate Republicans proposed an energy plan that included giving most taxpayers a 100 gas rebate and Congressional leaders called for a price gouging investigation. President Bush also said he wanted to increase automobile fuel efficiency standards and Exxon Mobil reported 8.4 billion in profits for the first quarter of the year. Blogging on gas prices peaked at 8,764 mentions/million during the week ending May 21, as bloggers reacted to General Motors' plan to offer subsidized gas in California and Florida to buyers of big SUVs like the Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon and the Hummer H2 and H3. People were also discussing the impact of gas prices on their Memorial Day travel plans. Umbria President Howard Kaushansky said his company collects millions of published blog post in a data warehouse, so that the company's analysts can look for trends. He compared it to a public opinion survey -- only without the survey. \\"By merely listening in on tens of millions of bloggers out there, there are now close to 40 million bloggers, we can identify what's on people's minds, what they talk about in an unprompted manner,\\" Kaushansky said. Umbria uses speech patterns to determine the age and gender of blog posters and divides the blogger population into three age groups: Kaushansky said male boomers tend to dominate political discussion, but that wasn't the case with gas prices. Members of Generation Y made up almost 55 percent of the blogging population during the week ending May 28, but they made up more than 69 percent of the posts on the subject. Boomer males, on the other hand, made up 13 percent of that population, but made just 10 percent of the posts. \\"I would have thought that gas prices was sort of an across the board issue for people, but it seems like it's a more younger issue and more young people are talking about it and talking about it more negatively,\\" Kaushansky said. Umbria director of product management Michael Sevilla said gas prices were cutting into the discretionary spending for members of Generation Y -- many of whom were just getting started in their careers, going to college, or still living with their parents. \\"Although they did not directly say it, they alluded to the fact that now a larger percentage of their meager dollars had to go to gas,\\" Sevilla said. \\"And that means less driving around to visit friends and fewer dollars to buy things.\\" Kaushansky said he was surprised that the study found a substantial number of positive comments about gas prices. For example, during the week ending March 12, there were 1,056 negative mentions of gas prices/million and 945 positive mentions. The remaining 2,031 mentions were either neutral, or too vague to determine the sentiment. But Kaushansky said that doesn't mean people were happy to pay more. Some posts argued it was good for the free market to run its course, even if it meant paying more for gas, he said. Others said that if it was OK for Derek Jeter to make millions playing baseball and Julia Roberts to get big paychecks for being in movies, then there was nothing wrong with Exxon Mobil's 8 billion profit. He said other positive posts came from people who were happy that they bought a hybrid or met a new friend on the bus.

Question: suppose Every breath I exhale carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect no baby will be born. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation is \\"every breath I exhale carbon dioxide\\". According to our current understanding of human biology and the carbon cycle, exhaling carbon dioxide is part of the natural respiratory process in humans, where we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.

Over the past year, fewer people like and support Mr. Abbott's government. This is not just in one area, but it's happening all over Australia. There is something called \\"polls\\" that help us know how many people support a political party. These polls show that Mr. Abbott's group, called the coalition, is not as popular as another group called Labor. This is like if you and your friends are choosing between two games to play, and more friends want to play the other game instead of Mr. Abbott's game. A big newspaper in Australia called \\"The Australian\\" shared this news with everyone. They said that in different parts of Australia, like Victoria, South Australia, NSW, Queensland, and Western Australia, the number of people who like Mr. Abbott's group has gone down a lot. It's kind of like missing points in a game. These polls also show that the Labor group has more support than Mr. Abbott's coalition in different parts of Australia, like in Victoria, NSW, South Australia, and Queensland. This means that if people had to choose which group they like more, they would pick the Labor group over the coalition. So, is it surprising that the government led by Mr. Abbott is not doing well? Not really, because the polls show that a lot of people don't like them as much anymore and prefer the other group, called Labor."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: Name the British scientist who shared the 2013 Nobel Prize for Physics.

Article: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs ?If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker--BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device , the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \\"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \\"The Russian Balance Sheet\\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \\"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas.\\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three. At very least, despite Russia's economic underperformance, its stock market outperformance does suggest it is indeed one of the group.

Kislyak, even though he did not disclose them to the Senate during his confirmation hearing and they occurred during the heat of the race between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Sessions was advising on national security. In his account on Thursday of the more substantive meeting, which took place in his Senate office on Sept. 8, Mr. Sessions described Mr. Kislyak as one of a parade of envoys who seek out lawmakers like him to glean information about American policies and promote the agendas of their governments. “Somehow, the subject of Ukraine came up,” Mr. Sessions said, recalling that the meeting grew testy after the ambassador defended Russia’s conduct toward its neighbor and heaped blame on everybody else. “I thought he was pretty much of an old-style, Soviet-type ambassador,” Mr. Sessions said, noting that he declined a lunch invitation from Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Sessions’s decision to recuse himself was one of his first public acts as attorney general. He said he made the decision after consulting with Justice Department officials, and he denied misleading Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, when he said in his confirmation hearing that he had not met with Russian officials about the Trump campaign. “In retrospect,” Mr. Sessions told reporters, “I should have slowed down and said, ‘But I did meet one Russian official a couple of times, and that would be the ambassador.’ ” ||||| poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201703/3091/1155968404_5345639518001_5345635105001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true Sessions recuses himself from Trump-Russia probe The attorney general is removing himself following reports he met twice with the Russian ambassador during Trump's campaign. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday that he will recuse himself from any investigations related to campaigns for president, including any probe into contacts between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russian officials. “I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign,” Sessions told reporters Thursday at a news conference at the Justice Department. Story Continued Below Sessions, who maintained support from Trump himself, said he consulted senior Justice Department staff for their “candid and honest opinion about what I should do.” “My staff recommended recusal,” he said. “They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just.” In a statement following his remarks, Sessions noted that his recusal goes for “any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaign for president of the United States.” He added, however, “This announcement should not be interpreted as confirmation of the existence of any investigation or suggestive of the scope of any such investigation.” A growing number of Republicans had called on Sessions to recuse himself — and Democratic leaders had insisted he resign altogether — after reports emerged Wednesday that Sessions had met twice with the Russian ambassador last year despite testifying during his confirmation hearing that he had no communications with Russians during the campaign, amplifying the Trump administration’s Russia problem. In an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News on Thursday evening, Sessions said that in the coming days he plans to to file a supplement to the Senate record to clarify that he did meet with the Russian ambassador. “I will definitely make that a part of the record,” he said. While talking with Carlson, he said he didn’t recall much specific about his conversation with the ambassador, apart from a disagreement about Ukraine policy. He said they didn’t discuss the presidential campaign in a “meaningful way.” Trump himself offered his support via a statement released later on Thursday night, saying the attorney general \\"did not say anything wrong.\\" \\"He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional,\\" Trump continued, before blasting Democrats for \\"overplaying their hand,\\" and decrying the \\"illegal leaks of classified and other information.\\" Sessions insisted Thursday that his statements at the hearing were “honest and correct” because his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were not related to the campaign but to official matters related to his service as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The attorney general, however, who was until three weeks ago a U.S. senator from Alabama, said he could not rule out the possibility the campaign came up when the Russian diplomat visited Sessions' Capitol Hill office in September. “I don’t recall,” Sessions told reporters. “Most of these ambassadors are pretty gossipy and this was in the campaign season, but I don’t recall any specific political discussions.” Sessions said his memories of the discussion were somewhat vague, although he suggested there was little chance of skullduggery because of the presence of two staffers from his office at the meeting. The pair are retired Army colonels, he noted. Sessions said he remembered Kislyak being “pretty much of an old-style Soviet-type ambassador” and denying any Russian wrongdoing in Ukraine. The exchange, he said, grew somewhat tense after Kislyak blamed the unrest in Ukraine on “everyone else.” “It got to be a little bit of a testy conversation at that point,” Sessions said. Sessions said he was preparing to send the Senate Judiciary Committee a letter clarifying his answers on Russia. He also said he regretted not mentioning the meetings. “In retrospect, I should have slowed down and said, ‘But I did meet one Russian official a couple of times,’” the attorney general added. After riding high on Trump’s well-received first address to Congress on Tuesday, the White House found itself mired once again in the scandal over whether Trump campaign officials had frequent contact with Russian officials last year, as officials from President Barack Obama’s administration were looking into allegations that the Russian government was engaging in cyberattacks to try to tilt the election Trump’s way. Calls for Sessions to recuse himself from the Justice Department’s investigation into ties between Trump and Russia had snowballed, following a Washington Post report Wednesday night exposing multiple meetings between Sessions and Kislyak during the campaign. Those meetings, one of which occurred during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, came amid an alleged effort by Russia to aid Trump’s campaign, for which Sessions was a prominent surrogate. During a Thursday afternoon tour of an aircraft carrier in Newport News, Virginia, Trump responded to a reporter's shouted question, saying that he had “total” confidence in Sessions. Asked if he knew about Sessions’ conversations with the Russian ambassador, Trump said, “I wasn't aware,” and asked if Sessions should recuse himself, the president responded, “I don’t think so.” Sessions did not disclose his meetings with the ambassador when asked about connections between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign during his confirmation hearings. In fact, he told Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) that “I did not have communications with the Russians.” In a set of written answers for Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Sessions said he had not been in contact with Russian officials regarding the 2016 campaign. Aboard the aircraft carrier, Trump said Sessions “probably did” tell the truth in his testimony to Franken and Leahy. “This is the latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats. [Attorney] General Sessions met with the ambassador in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is entirely consistent with his testimony,” a White House official said. “It’s no surprise Sen. Al Franken is pushing this story immediately following President Trump's successful address to the nation.” In an interview with Fox News, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Sessions “did his job” and had been “100 percent straight” with the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings. He said Democrats were guilty of “continuing to push a false narrative for political purposes.” “Look, there’s nothing to recuse himself [from],” Spicer added. “He was 100 percent straight with the committee, and I think that people who are choosing to play partisan politics with this should be ashamed of themselves.” When Sessions was asked why he recused himself despite Trump and Spicer saying he should not, the attorney general said they were not familiar with the ethics standards involved. “I feel like they don’t know the rules, the ethics rules. Most people don’t,” he said. “But when you evaluate the rules, I feel like ... I should not be involved investigating a campaign I had a role in.” A spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, speaking to CNN on Thursday morning, said Kislyak is a “world-class diplomat” who has “communicated with his American colleagues through decades on different fields.” She said CNN had accused Kislyak of being a Russian spy and warned the network to “stop spreading lie[s] and false news” as she walked away from her interviewer. In a brief exchange Thursday morning with a reporter from NBC News, Sessions himself had said he would recuse himself “whenever it’s appropriate” but denied that he had discussed the campaign with Russian officials. “I have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaign, and those remarks are unbelievable to me and are false,” he said. But a senior national security official from the Obama administration said ties between Trump and Russia were a source of grave concern for the outgoing administration in its final days. The official said he had no specific information that Sessions was among those interfacing with the Kremlin on behalf of the incoming administration, but he said former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign over misstatements to Vice President Mike Pence and others about conversations with the Russian ambassador, was not acting alone. “It seems pretty clear that [Flynn] was not a rogue here,” the senior official said. “I don’t believe that Flynn was the only person promising things to the Russians, communicating to them what would happen once the Trump administration came in.” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, on Thursday called for Sessions to step down, saying the senator had not met \\"his own rigorous standard\\" for \\"complete and truthful testimony.\\" Schiff complained earlier Thursday following a briefing by FBI Director James Comey that the bureau was withholding information regarding its probe into the Kremlin’s efforts to interfere in last year’s election. “I would say at this point we know less than a fraction of what the FBI knows,” Schiff told reporters following the briefing. “I appreciate we had a long briefing and testimony from the director today, but in order for us to do our investigation in a thorough and credible way, we're gonna need the FBI to fully cooperate, to be willing to tell us the length and breadth of any counterintelligence investigations they are conducting.” As the furor over Sessions grew, about 150 people gathered outside the Justice Department to demanded that he step down. “Lock him up! Perjury is a crime. Sessions resign!” protesters chanted. Those turning out to call for Sessions’ exit heard from several Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Nydia Velazquez, Eleanor Holmes Norton and Sheila Jackson Lee. The demonstrators cheered as Lee said, incorrectly, that House Speaker Paul Ryan had just called on Sessions to recuse himself from the probe into alleged Russian tampering with the U.S. election. “Not enough,” Lee declared. “We will be sending a letter to president Trump asking him to seek the resignation of his attorney general or fire him right on the spot.” Even after Sessions announced his recusal, it wasn’t enough for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who accused him of perjury while calling for his resignation. His “narrow recusal and his sorry attempt to explain away his perjury are totally inadequate,” she said a statement. “Attorney General Sessions’ lies to the Senate and to the American people make him unfit to serve as the chief law enforcement officer of our country. He must resign immediately.” Republicans, in contrast, scoffed at the idea of a resignation. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he had recommended recusal to Sessions earlier Thursday. “First and foremost, any talk of resignation is nonsense,” Grassley said in a statement. “There’s little doubt that alleged conflicts, no matter how flimsy and regardless of whether or not they are based in fact, will be used against him to discredit him and any potential investigation into alleged conversations between the campaign and the Russian government. So, his actions today were the right thing to do.” At a press conference Thursday morning, Ryan had said Sessions need not recuse himself unless he becomes the subject of an investigation, at which point the attorney general would “of course” step aside. The speaker said he had seen no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian government officials during the 2016 campaign. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter Thursday to Comey, the FBI director, and U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips, seeking a criminal investigation into Sessions. The letter, signed by every Democrat on the panel, suggested Sessions may have been in violation of perjury and lying to Congress laws and asked the FBI for a briefing on its investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia. The Democrats said Sessions’ rationales for meeting Kislyak “appear to be disingenuous at best as the questions put to him did not in any way ask if the meeting was campaign related.” “This is obviously a very serious matter,” they wrote.

Sessions, a longtime U.S. senator who was an early and high-ranking player in President Donald Trump’s campaign before becoming the country’s top law enforcement official, announced the decision after several fellow Republicans in Congress suggested the move would be appropriate. “I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign,” Sessions told reporters at a hastily arranged news conference. Sessions said he had been weighing recusal - ruling himself out from any role in the investigations - even before the latest twist of the controversy over ties between Trump associates and Russia that has dogged the early days of the Trump presidency. The president backed Sessions, saying Democrats had politicized the issue and calling the controversy a “total witch hunt.” Sessions’ announcement did nothing to quell concerns among congressional Democrats, a number of whom called for Sessions to step down. Trump and Republicans who control Congress are trying to move past early administration missteps and focus on issues important to them, including immigration, tax cuts and repealing the Obamacare healthcare law. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump’s favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Sessions denied he had contact with Russian officials when he was asked directly during his Senate confirmation hearing to become attorney general whether he had exchanged information with Russian operatives during the election campaign. He told reporters he was “honest and correct” in his response, although he acknowledged he “should have slowed down” and mentioned he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator. “I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,” Sessions said, adding he felt he should not be involved in investigating a campaign in which he had had a role. In a statement on Thursday night, Trump said Sessions “did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional.” Sessions’ meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak were disclosed on Wednesday night by the Washington Post. Sessions received Kislyak in his Senate office in September and also met him in July at a Heritage Foundation event at the Republican National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors. Trump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn last month after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak before Trump took office and that Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The recusal means Sessions, a powerful member of Trump’s inner circle, will not be briefed on details of any probe. Should the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to move forward with charges, Sessions would not be in a position to weigh in on whether the Department of Justice should take the case.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas CALLS TO RESIGN House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi urged Sessions to resign and said “his narrow recusal and sorry attempt to explain away his perjury” were inadequate. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Sessions’ explanation for failing to tell the Senate about his meetings “is simply not credible.” He called on Sessions to step down and said the Justice Department should name an independent prosecutor to investigate Russian interference. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to launch a criminal investigation into Sessions’ statements to Congress about his communication with Russian officials. Sessions is one of many “subjects” of a government investigation of any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, two U.S. officials familiar with the probe said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sessions was not now a “target” of the probe by the FBI, the Treasury Department, the CIA and the National Security Agency. The investigation, one of the officials said, had a number of subjects because of the numerous contacts between associates of Trump, including Flynn, and the Russian Embassy in Washington as well as Russian and some Ukrainian businessmen and companies. At least two other officials in Trump’s campaign said they also spoke with the Russian ambassador at a conference on the sidelines of the July convention last July, USA Today reported on Thursday. Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner also met with Kislyak in December at Trump Tower in New York, an administration official said on Thursday, confirming a report in the New Yorker. While there is nothing legally wrong with such meetings, the reported contacts raise questions about the White House’s repeated statements that it knew of no further contacts with Russian officials beyond those by Flynn. Slideshow (4 Images) Trump has accused officials in former Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. The White House dismissed the disclosure of the Sessions meetings as a partisan attack, saying his contacts with the ambassador had been as a member of the Armed Services Committee. Trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia, drawing criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Ties with Russia have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscow’s military interference in Ukraine, military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and President Vladimir Putin’s intolerance of political dissent. With his administration on the defensive over Russia, Trump’s enthusiasm seems to have cooled, and his top foreign policy advisers have begun talking tougher about Moscow. The Russian Embassy in Washington, shrugging off the uproar, said on Thursday it was in regular contact with “U.S. partners.” |||||Summary:","output":"US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has decided to recuse himself from any future investigations into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election, however, he insists he did nothing wrong when he failed to disclose meetings that took place last year with Russia’s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.

He was on the point of launching this project, having invested 1,000 of his own money (equal to 25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series. In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life. He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits. Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls. Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home. Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co. With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York. According to Snow, Longacre was known as the best engraver in the country. answer the following question: What were the last names of the people who agreed to work together on the The American Portrait Gallery? Answer:","output":"Longacre and Herring"},{"instruction":"First question: Is one a prime number? Second question: Is one a composite or prime number? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: No, one is not a prime number. A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and can only be divided by 1 and itself. Since one is only divisible by 1, it cannot be a prime number. Second question: One is neither a composite nor a prime number. A composite number is a number that has more than two factors. One only has one factor, which is 1 itself, so it is not composite either. These two questions are related but not the same. The first question asks if one is a prime number, and the second question asks if one is either a composite or a prime number. The answer to both questions is that one is neither prime nor composite."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Adare Manor, architect, \\"James Pain and George Richard Pain,\\"; Adare Manor, completionDate, 1862; Adare Manor, buildingStartDate, \\"1700\\"","output":"To generate a sentence about this data, I will follow these steps: 1.

The line is a part of the larger quote \\"Theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die,\\" found in the sixth stanza of the poem. The poem narrates the courageous, yet doomed, charge of the British Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava, which took place on October 25, 1854, as a part of the Crimean War. The military action was marked by a monumental error in communication amongst British commanders, which led to a reckless charge by the Light Brigade, comprising nearly 600 men, into a heavily fortified Russian position. Tennyson's line has subsequently come to signify blind obedience to authority without questioning. The poem is an exploration of the complex reality of war, where soldiers often place their lives on the line by following orders, sometimes blindly, out of a sense of duty and loyalty. In the context of the poem, the line is intended to convey the sense of camaraderie and the spirit of sacrifice among these soldiers, who did not question their orders but instead, charged headlong into a dangerous situation, fully aware of the likelihood of death. At the same time, it serves as a critique of poor leadership and the potential consequences of prioritizing obedience over critical thinking. \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" has been referenced and adapted in various forms of popular culture over the years, including music, film, and television. Its message about the human spirit in the face of adversity, as well as the implications of unquestioning loyalty to authority, resonates with people even to this day."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},H=["disabled"],E={key:0},j={key:1};function F(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
